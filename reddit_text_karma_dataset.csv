1n6geug,offmychest,My autistic co-worker just cried in my arms. Saddest day ever,"Today my co-worker walked into work and he kept hovering around my desk but looking really gloomy. And I mean like cartoon gloomy, hanging his head and whimpering. So I asked him, ""What's up, Brian? Have you eaten?""

He suddenly got down onto the floor by my desk and actually started to cry. He told me his cat, who has been with him since he was 11 (Brian is in his 30s) died today, and that was his last living family member. I immediately put my arms around him and this poor man just curled up into like an almost fetal position and sobbed in my arms like he's never ever cried in his whole life. He kept repeating ""Kitty's gone"" and ""I don't have Kitty anymore.""

I toughed it out and didn't cry the whole time including when I and another coworker walked him home - and my other coworker stayed with Brian to have dinner and watch a movie with him, cause he knows Brian likes Pokémon and he likes Pokémon too.

But yeah now I'm at home and bawling my eyes out too. That was genuinely the saddest thing I have ever had to do. Poor Brian. He must have loved that cat so, so much.

EDIT: Y'all, Idk what to say, I feel slightly embarrassed reading all of the nice things everyone's saying.

1leyhfb,offmychest,Every night my wife does something that breaks me,"Im just so overwhelmed with emotion i thought id share. My wife of one year, partner of 8 years (university sweethearts) does something every night that honestly just wipes my brain.

Shes always had a perfect sleep schedule and i never have. Were working on aligning sleep now but so far, she usually goes to bed way before i do. Lets say she goes to bed at 11 pm and i get into bed 2 to 3 am.

Every night when i get into bed, she extends her leg and rests her little foot on the top of mine. Sometimes its accompanied by a little adorable “hmm” sound she makes as if shes confused. With a questioning tonality. Im usually freezing and her foot is so toasty from having been sleeping for hours already.

She sometimes also kind of … pats my foot with hers. She would lay her foot on mine then pat her toes on my foot kind of like a “hi” or a “hmm all checks out” gesture. She is entirely unconscious doing this. 

I could be having the worst day of my life and damn near pulling my hair out from stress, and as soon as she does that i can’t help but laugh, and instantly deflate. Its so adorable and honest that i just basically die.

1ibqnu3,offmychest,My fiancée saw me walk up the front doors of his work and his heart dropped,"I just knew. I just knew today would be a good day. 

Normally I don’t like going by his work when I get off as traffic is usually ridiculous and I’m already exhausted. 
But I had a strenuous day at work and his restaurant has great food and drinks and aren’t typically busy on Mondays. Traffic was light due to the rainy weather, and I was able to get off work early for once. 

I picked his son up from school and we were on the way. Anticipation building up in my stomach. Excitement. 

We pull in, his son and me get out, hand in hand, walking up to the glass front doors, waiting for him to notice…..

And boy…when he did…

He shut his eyes and threw his head back, hand clutching his chest, nearly tearing up. 

I let go of our son’s hand and let him go run and hug and comfort his father with arms wide open and the biggest smile. They held each other so tight. Two steps behind, as I walked up, my soon to be husband was so quick to discreetly grab us both, keeping us close, off to the side to give me a proper embrace. We all hugged, his grip was tight. 
He finally pulled away, seconds feeling like minutes, looked me in the eyes with a mix of sadness and anxiety and said “how did you know? How did you know I needed you today?” And I just looked him in the eyes and said, I don’t know, but maybe because I needed you too.

The look in his eyes, filled with love and relief when he saw us, the way he lets us know he is ours, just reassures me that this man is whole heartedly committed to me and us and our future, and I could not be more blessed.

Two months ago, I heard banging and cursing through the wall. I knocked, and found him standing in a puddle with a wrench in one hand and a YouTube tutorial paused on his iPad. The kitchen sink was spraying water like a busted fire hydrant.

I’m no plumber, but I offered to help. Took me an hour, two towels, and one trip to Home Depot. When I finished, he just grunted and said, “Huh. Thanks.”

After that, I started checking in. Bringing his mail up. Picking up his meds. Talking baseball in the hallway. He never said much, but he’d nod a little longer each time.

Two weeks ago, he passed away. Massive heart attack. I figured that was that.

Yesterday, a lawyer called me. Turns out he left me his condo in his will. Paid off. Furniture included. Apparently, I was the only person who “bothered to give a damn.”

1it4n6y,offmychest,Stopped a rape last night,"I went to a deli around midnight last night for food. I see this really young girl (she’s maybe 21 or 22) who is incredibly intoxicated. She can’t even stand up. I look over and I see this creepy delivery guy, who is in his late 50s or 60s, literally telling her “let me take you somewhere to feel better.” He keeps trying to give her something she does not want. I’m too far away to see what it is. Moments later, he sits her down in a chair and is clearly trying to coax her into leaving with him. I call the police and they claim they’ll be there soon. 10 minutes pass and no one arrives.

I go outside, and all of a sudden, I see this guy HOLDING HER UP and dragging her through the streets of New York. He is aggressively making out with her and she has no idea where she is.

I called the police again to no avail. I follow them and finally, the guy gets to his apartment and I had to intervene. I asked him if he knows this girl. He gets startled and backs away. She grabs me for a drunk hug. The guy panics and says he is the police, then changes his story to that’s his sister. He reaches in his pocket to make it seem like he had a badge or gun. I completely ignore it because adrenaline had taken over at this point. I wasn't going to let this POS intimidate me. I asked the girl if she knew this dude or if she knew where she was, and she says no, they were going to have a “fun time.” I then asked her if she wanted that and she told me no, she just wanted to go home. I snatched the girl’s stuff from his hands and we walk away. The loser pulls out his phone to record us. I suspect he was going to flip and say I was the one harming her.

We go into a bodega down the street to kill time. She is a mess — crying and saying she wants to call her dog to pick her up. The bodega owner steps in to keep her calm. That’s how drunk she was. A small crowd gathers inside the store because no one knows what’s going on. Luckily, a bystander intervened because he saw the fucking loser STILL lurking outside waiting for her to leave. This idiot finally comes in the store and acts as if he knows her. The police show up (after 20 - 30 minutes) and questions him. He can’t keep track of his lies, so they kick him out and warn him to stay away from her. The police eventually orders her an Uber from her phone to send her home.

I am a little shaken up by it. I know it’s 2025, but I cannot believe this guy was going to sexually assault this girl if I had not intervened. The one thing that still bothers me were the cops telling me afterwards that it was no big deal because people get drunk all the time in the city. Yet they thanked me anyway. No, this was going to be rape. Blatant rape.

I feel like I fucked up because this guy has footage of me and I don’t have footage of him. I don’t know. I guess I’m venting at this point. I feel like this should not be traumatic for me in any way, but I’ve been thinking about it ever since. So fucked up, man.

1llzpqz,offmychest,My grandfather had a 4 year old daughter before he died. My whole family wants to send her to an orphanage. I said I’ll take her and now everything in my life is upside down.,"Hi. I’m 23M, and this week my entire life changed.

Three days ago, my grandfather passed away. He was 78. He had two kids: my mom and my uncle. I’m the youngest in our family, or at least I thought I was.

My family is very big.

During the wake, a huge bomb dropped on all of us. It turns out my grandfather had a four year old daughter. With a cleaning lady who used to help him around the house. The woman is gone and no one knows where she went. The girl’s name is Lenka, and she’s tiny, quiet, and completely alone. And everyone in my family hates her.

At the funeral, nobody would even look at her. I saw her curled up in the corner of the room, like she was trying to disappear. And the only conversation anyone had was who’s NOT going to take her. They all agreed she should be sent to an orphanage.

I don’t know what happened to me at that moment, but I snapped. I walked over to her, knelt down, smiled, and asked, Would you like to live with me?  
She didn’t say anything. Just slowly nodded. And that was it.

That night, Lenka came home with me. She had been staying with my cousin for a few days, and Nika handed me her health card and basically said good luck. I’m a 23-year old guy living alone in a small apartment in eastern Slovakia. I work from home. I pay rent. I’m not rich. I’ve never raised a child. I’m still an external university student. I go to school on weekends. But she came with me. And she’s been here since.

That night she didn’t say a word on the car ride. I showed her my apartment, gave her food. She barely reacted. Later that night, while I was trying to sleep… I broke. It was 2 a.m. and I was crying like I haven’t cried in years.

I kept thinking: What the hell am I doing?  
How can I raise a child when I’m just a kid myself?  
My family won’t help. Everyone will judge me. She’s not even technically my niece she’s my aunt.

(Yeah. That part’s wild. She’s my mom’s half-sister. Which makes her my aunt. But she’s 4.)

I couldn’t sleep at all that night. Around 3am we had a little accident, she wet the bed. She didn’t cry. She just tried to hide the blanket like she didn’t want me to find out. My heart cracked in half. I told her everything’s okay and helped her clean up.

In the morning, I explained we needed to go shopping for her things. We walked to the store only 5 minutes away, but it took us 15. She was trying to be independent and didn’t want to hold my hand. But on the way back, she was so tired she almost collapsed on the sidewalk. I asked if I could carry her, and she said no at first but after a few more steps, I picked her up anyway. She looked annoyed, but didn’t resist. We made it home.

I made her breakfast (thank you to the friend who gave me ideas), then told her we had to go to some offices so I could become her guardian.

I thought I’d just drop off the papers. Instead, the whole process started immediately.

It was chaos. I brought every document I had, my ID, death certificate, her health card, a letter I wrote asking for emergency temporary custody. But when I got to the child services office (ÚPSVaR), one woman… tore me apart.

She was cold and cruel and basically called me a stupid boy to my face.  
You’re just a kid.  
You can’t raise another kid.  
You don’t even have rights to her.  
She’s better off with her mother.

And she said all of this in front of Lenka, who was sitting quietly in my lap.

I looked down and saw tears running down her face. At first, I didn’t even notice just felt her little body trembling. She was crying silently.

I gently apologized to the woman, stood up, and said we’d come back later. I took Lenka outside and walked her to a little ice cream shop nearby. We sat together in silence. I explained we’d have to go back and talk to the mean lady, but I promised I’d stay with her the whole time. She nodded.

Back inside, the woman didn’t get any nicer, but she did explain what would happen next. Basically exactly what I had read online: social workers will visit us. They'll try to contact her mother. If they find her, she may get legal priority. But I’m going to fight this. Because if that woman abandoned Lenka once, she’ll do it again. And I won’t let that happen.

Now it’s late again. I’m completely drained. And I need to say this somewhere: I love this kid.  
I’ve known her for three days and I’d do anything to protect her.  
But I’m falling apart inside.

I work from home, which is the only reason this is even possible. But on weekends I go to university, and I’ll probably have to give that up. There's no babysitting culture here in Slovakia, especially not in a small town like ours.

I’m selling my motorcycle so I’ll have more money for her.  
I’m terrified I’ll never find a girlfriend because what 23 year old wants a boyfriend with a 4 year old?

I feel like I traded everything I used to be… for someone who deserves a better life. And I don’t regret it.

But I’m scared. And tired. And trying not to break.  
I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I just needed to let it out.

1i0drsp,offmychest,"My Stepdad Lied About Me Being Pregnant to “Teach Me a Lesson,” and It Traumatized Me","When I was 15, my stepdad decided to “teach me a lesson” about responsibility in the most cruel and manipulative way imaginable. He lied and told me I was pregnant. It has come out that i had had premarital sex. He made me pee in a cup and claimed he “tested” it. I didn’t see what he did, but he came back and said I was pregnant. I had no reason to doubt him.

For roughly five months, 18 weeks, I believed I was going to have a baby. My body even seemed to respond—I gained weight, had morning sickness, cravings, and even felt what I thought were kicks. I mentally prepared for this child. I grieved the life I thought I’d lose as a teen mom but also grew to love the baby I thought was growing inside me. My reputation at school took the expected hit. And then the hit you'd expect when i don't end up having that baby. Yep, i became that girl.

When I finally asked about getting prenatal care, he laughed and told me he’d lied the entire time. It was at the dinner table and I'll never forget my mental state shattering. I was devastated among many other things. To make things worse, he found the pregnancy journal I had been writing in every week for the baby to one day read. He confiscated it and quoted it back to me laughing at my thoughts and feelings for weeks afterward.

It felt like I had lost a child, even though there was never a baby. It always felt wrong to say i suffered a miscarriage so i never felt like i could talk to somebody about the kind of grief i felt.

This experience has haunted me for years. It’s left me with trust issues, trauma, and a lingering grief that’s hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t been through something similar. I’ve tried to find others who’ve had an experience like mine, but I haven’t found anything.

I wanted to share my story here because I feel like this kind of thing hasn't been talked about. If you’ve been through something similar, I’d love to hear from you. And if not, thank you for letting me get this off my chest. 

ETA - The first time i ended up actually pregnant, they ended up being twins. This feels symbolic. Like i was given the child i ended up not having in addition to the one i was to have then. It's comforting when i look at it that way. Like my love for them was real even if they weren't. So real that the baby just HAD to come into existence.

She kept saying, “I don’t want to go alone.”

So I told her, “They’re waiting for you, Grandma. Your mom’s making your favorite soup, your dad’s got your old piano ready.”

Son: [Friend] at school talked about it and I haven’t heard of it. 

H: Well, sometimes depending on what a woman is wearing, you can see shapes and lines through her clothing, between her legs. 

S: Oh. Weird. 

H: Not weird, just natural, with some leggings or swimsuits or whatever. 

S: Is it ok to look?

H: It’s ok to glance but never stare and never make a woman uncomfortable. 

S: Do you notice if ladies have cameltoe?

H: Sure, sometimes. 

S: do you look?

H: Of course I notice sometimes but it’s just their body, who they are. When you’re a man you will learn you can notice things and see they are pretty without being a weirdo about it. 

S: Have you even noticed mom that way?

H: Sure. 

S: Her friends?

H: Sure, it happens. They’re women, it’s natural. 

S: What about boobs? Ok to look?

H: Same answer. It can be part of a woman’s appearance, it’s fine to glance respectfully. 

S: You notice mom and her friends’ boobs?

H: Yes, sure. Have you finished your homework?

1l9zkfg,offmychest,My wife bought me Dark Souls… and I’ve been lying to her ever since.,"Two weeks ago, it was my birthday.  
I woke up in the morning and found my wife making breakfast. The moment she turned around, I knew something was up. She’s never been good at hiding her emotions or lying. Her eyes were sparkling, and she was smiling from ear to ear.

She gave me a big warm hug, then immediately ran to the hallway closet. She pulled out something blue, and I instantly knew, it had to be a PS4 game. I know her too well, and I knew she wouldn't be able to wait. She had to give me the gift first thing in the morning. Honestly, I was surprised she hadn’t told me about it earlier.

She walked up to me with her hands behind her back, grinning even harder than before. She looked like she was about to burst with excitement… and then boom right in front of my face lands Dark Souls Trilogy.

I started panicking a little on the inside, because… well, I had already platinumed all the Dark Souls games years ago. But then I remembered all the times I’d casually complained to her about how modern games are too easy, lacking real challenge. She knows I like challenging games, even though she barely plays anything herself just The Sims, really.

I suddenly felt this wave of guilt. I imagined her googling something like “hardest games in the world” just to find the perfect gift for me.  
I tried to act surprised and asked, “What kind of game is this?”  
She proudly lifted her chin and told me it was the hardest game in the world and that even *I* wouldn’t be able to beat it.

After that came some playful flirting and a lovely day together… but I knew what was coming.

That evening after dinner at a restaurant, we got home and she sat on the couch, just staring at the game she’d bought like an excited little kid. I told her we’d play together after I took a shower. I went first, then her.

While she was in the shower, I made a new PSN account and started installing Dark Souls 1. I decided to pick a build I had never used before, to make it at least somewhat believable and so she wouldn’t catch on that I had played it before.

I played like a total noob or at least I tried to.  
Every time I died, she laughed, and I pretended to be frustrated.  
It took me like an hour to even get to Firelink Shrine… but seeing her having fun, seeing that beautiful smile that was the real gift. The best one.

And that’s how it’s been for the past two weeks.  
Every evening, we find 2 hours to sit down and play Dark Souls together.  
Yes, she plays too. We take turns after every death.  
She even started watching lore videos on YouTube and learning how builds work.  
Sometimes, she brings up build ideas over dinner like, “Hey, what if we switch our weapon for better scaling?”

But now… I feel like the biggest jerk and manipulator in the world.

I love our gaming sessions, but I still haven’t told her the truth.  
We’re both adults, and I know she could handle it but I enjoy this time together so much.  
I don’t want to ruin it. I don’t want to break this little thing we both clearly love.

I just needed to get this off my chest.  
I’d really appreciate any advice.  
And yeah… I know. I’m kind of a huge asshole.",7728,0.98,7728,0,7889.0,161.0,551,1749766467.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l9zkfg/my_wife_bought_me_dark_souls_and_ive_been_lying/,False,True
1m4268i,offmychest,My sister killed herself and I’m glad she wasn’t found sooner,"My older sister killed herself in January. We had an extremely strained relationship. She moved back home with my dad and I. My dad found her dead in her bedroom when he got home from a work trip. It was about 15 hours before she was found. 

She called me on the phone from her upstairs bedroom to ask me to bring her water, very weakly but that did not click with me at the time. I was downstairs in the living room. Due to our strained relationship, I told her to get it herself. I did not know it, but she was actively dying.

To get to the point, through my guilt and grief, I have come to the realization that if I were to have brought her water, I would’ve found her in her dying state. I would’ve called the police. Panic would’ve ensued. Due to what she took, there would’ve been absolutely no way to reverse the effects. Found on time or not, she would’ve died regardless. 

I’ve come to think about the fact that she died in her quiet bedroom. Maybe she had music playing. She was in her own silence. If I were to have found her and called 911, maybe her last dying thoughts would’ve been regret and panic amongst chaos, rather than peace and silence amongst her own final thoughts. 

I am coping with this everyday of my life. I wish I had my entire life to do over with her, I wish my last words to her weren’t so nasty. Thank you for listening.

1oihuxm,offmychest,Something happened yesterday changed my view on women’s health,"Yesterday during one of our classes, we had a group presentation. While waiting for our turn, I noticed that one of my group members ( who’s a female) suddenly became tachypneic (started breathing rapidly). I asked if she was okay, and she explained that she has chronic sinusitis and usually breathes through her mouth because of congestion.

After our presentation, she sat down and her face was red, and she was clearly struggling to breathe. I asked again if she was okay, she looked at me while crying silently. I took her outside and tried to calm her down, but she was extremely tachypneic and told me, “I can’t breathe,” and that her hands and mouth were tingling (which happens with rapid breathing btw).

I called the nurse, and the first question she asked was, “Are you having a panic attack?” The girl said no and mentioned that she has sinusitis flare up, but the nurse proceeded to say, “It’s okay, maybe this is your first presentation of a panic attack,” and continued asking if she was feeling stressed or struggling mentally, keep in mind that the poor girl was literally out of breath and saying she felt like she was going to faint. I was like WTH??. I told the nurse, “Can we please check her vitals? She has a sinus infection, this could be something serious.”

After about 15 minutes, the nurse finally checked her vitals: her temperature was 39°C, her blood pressure was 150/95, and her pulse was high. I immediately offered to drive her to the ED with one of her friends because I KNEW this clearly wasn’t a panic attack.

And guess what? She was later diagnosed with SIRS, which could have progressed to sepsis if we hadn’t acted quickly.

As a guy, This situation made me truly reflect on how women’s pain is dismissed or labeled as an emotional response rather than a legitimate medical concern. The sad part is that this bias came from another woman. I genuinely doubt the nurse would’ve said the same thing if it was a dude.

No offense to those who experience panic attacks (they’re absolutely serious as well) but my point is that women’s pain/health issues is too often misattributed to psychological causes instead of being investigated as a result of a possible pathological process.

Edit: I didn’t expect this amount of women experience with the healthcare system, some of y’all stories are crazy. 
Also I just did what any decent human could’ve done :). 

Edit2: For those of you asking about the girl, thank God she’s doing very well now. As for filing a complaint against the nurse, she refused to do so. However, I believe that not advocating for yourself only makes things worse for others. If everyone keeps avoiding the elephant in the room, how will we ever make a change? I think I’ll speak to the nurse about it, since I truly hope such a situation won’t happen to someone else in the future.",7380,0.99,7380,0,7455.0,75.0,477,1761677316.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oihuxm/something_happened_yesterday_changed_my_view_on/,False,True
1lmng23,offmychest,A man at my gym made me feel safe yesterday with a very simple gesture,"I’m 20 F and am a regular at my local gym. Anyone who goes to the gym knows that you start to see the regulars there all the time. I’m pretty reserved but there’s a couple other girls I’ve gotten to know. 

There’s a handful of guys that I recognise who just do their thing and keep themselves to themselves, and will nod or smile. One of these guys always seems kinda grumpy honestly. Doesn’t seem like a bad person but always so serious and never seems to smile. Certainly not something that bothers me but just one of those things you observe. Probably in his late thirties. 

So yesterday I was at the gym in a big open room with various free weights, skipping ropes, TRX bands etc. this guy comes in who I’ve never seen and I can see him looking at my butt through the mirror for an extended amount of time. He’s probably in his fifties. He then walks over to me and asks me what I’m working on, I tell him it’s leg day, he says it’s back day for him. He then starts basically telling me how to work out and the whole time he’s deeply looking into my eyes and is just really giving off creeper vibes. He’s not some nuisance fuck boy, he’s a creepy guy that’s probably double my age and I’m getting genuinely bad vibes. And I realise I’m kind of cornered. I don’t think anything physical is about to happen, but he started to make “flirty” comments and I just feel a bit suffocated. E.g. he asked about my glutes, and then asked if I like to work them while wearing this awful kind of flirt face. It’s just us two and I’m feeling kind of trapped and anxious. 

So then the grumpy guy walks in, with his usual stare ahead face and pulls a couple weights off the rack. He notices this guy rambling at me in the corner, and through the mirror he stares at the guy, then at me and gives me a little nod, as in “you good?” And I sort of widen my eyes a bit. I already feel awkward because what’s going to happen here? It’s not like I’m being physically attacked. But without hesitation, Mr Grumpy just goes “hey mate, want to give her some space?” And he goes “what?” To which he responds “yeah, this room is massive, you’ve got her a bit cornered there haven’t you?” and the guy sort of laughed, then looked extremely flustered and said “yeah ok whatever, I was just talking” and walked off. I’ll add Grumpy man is a lot bigger than this guy, which in the world if men means something when it comes to this kind of interaction. 

Grumpy went to put his head phones back on and I said thanks, and he said ”no worries, I’ve got a daughter who’s probably not much younger than you so I’m learning how it can be. I’ve got your back.” Then he just went back to working out and so did I. 

I know this whole thing sounds blown out of proportion but I think the other women here will understand how easy it is to feel intimidated by a strange man, m also how relived it feels to feel safe—and that grumpy man I can tell totally has my back.

1kw1jyb,offmychest,I caught my mom reading my teenage daughter’s diary. Again.,"My daughter is 15. Sensitive, smart, and introverted. She journals almost every night. It’s her way of processing the world. She trusts me to respect her space. I always have.

My mother, on the other hand…

We live with her temporarily. Financial reasons. My mom is helpful in some ways, but she’s always been nosy. I’ve caught her reading my daughter’s diary before. I told her, firmly, to stop. That it was a boundary. That it was not okay.

She cried, made herself the victim, and promised never again.

Last week, I came home early from work and saw her on the couch reading it.

No shame. No apology. Just said, “You should see the things she writes. She’s depressed. She needs help.”

I told her to stop. She said, “I’m her grandmother, I have a right to know what’s going on.”

No. She doesn’t. She broke my child’s trust.

My daughter hasn’t written in it since. She told me, quietly, that she feels violated. That she doesn’t even want to stay in the house anymore.

1kh5ozy,offmychest,I kicked the shit out of my rapist,"A year ago I (20) was raped by an insane gross methead (50). He offered me drugs when I was so drunk I could barely walk. We got to his apartment, he raped me for five hours while I was drugged up. 

He left for the bathroom sometime during it, I managed to grab my phone and started an audio recording. It's three hours long and it's horrible. I never stop saying no, begging him to please stop, please let me go, sobbing, struggling. 

I turned it over to the police who have sat around twiddling their thumbs doing absolutely nothing for a year. He walks free, I see him all the time, small town. I reported it because I didn't want anyone to be hurt in the same way. 

The police and hospital repaid me by informing my parents about this even though I specifically asked every single person I met during the process to please not do that (that's illegal btw).
Backstory finished. 

Yesterday I walked into the store and see Mr. Meth sitting on the floor. I was quite drunk (drinking problem who?). I walked up to him and spoke to him for the first time since it happened. He said some disgusting vile sexual things and made gestures that make my skin crawl just thinking about it. 

He then asked me why I would involve the police, and said: ""Why didn't you just say no?""

I kind of lost it, I responded in the only appropriate way by kicking his face in. It was in broad daylight in public, security and police were called, but I got him good. He was yelling and whining about how there were cameras and the police were going to get me. It was the most cathartic amazing thing I have ever done. 

I went outside to smoke while waiting for the police. I was frustrated that it was taking so long, so I went back in and just attacked him again. He was better prepared this time but I got in many glorious punches to his head and face. 

Eventually the cops arrived, they put him in the back of the police car and spoke to me. After he was gone I was just a sobbing mess. I told them the whole truth, that I was the one who instigated it, that I was quite drunk, what he'd done to me etc.
To my absolute bewilderment, they let me go? Maybe they felt bad for me since I was sobbing so much. They arrested him and put him in the back of the car, and I was free to leave.

They gave us both the same assault charge. I don't really know what to make of all of this, but it was deeply satisfying and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. 
Besides, if he didn't want to get kicked in the face, why didn't he just say no?

She usually looks forward to her birthday like any other kid her age and loves choosing what she gets to do. Although this time I was secretly hoping she would say something I can afford at the moment like she wants to get McD's or something like that but her reply completely threw me off. She told me that the only thing she wants for her birthday is to see her mom just one last time then she burst into tears. That completely broke me, I could only hug her and comfort her all while fighting back my own tears.

I know it will get better in time because we do talk about how she's feeling about everything often and she also talks to someone at school as well but it just tore me up and I will never forget that moment.

1mzoicn,offmychest,"I’m pregnant. My mom wants to come stay with us after we deliver the baby. Not so she can take care of her, but so she can take care of me.","My mom had me unexpectedly when she was in high school, and she raised me on her own. So growing up, it was really the two of us against the world. I’ve always thought of her as a super woman for so many reasons; she’s my best friend.

I’m 28 now, happily married to my high school sweetheart, and we are expecting our first (a daughter!) here in a few months. My mom requested to plan my baby shower, and of course, I was elated at the offer. We had a 3 hour long phone call a few days ago, going over the invite list, theme, registry, all the things. Towards the end of the call, she told me she really wanted to come stay with us after we deliver her. 

She said we’ve probably gotten this offer a ton (and we have), but said she didn’t want to do it to take care of the baby. She wants to come to take care of me. 

She told me when she had me, it was the happiest time in her life. But after I was born, everyone was so focused on me. My mom could barely walk for several weeks afterwards, and she said no one seemed to really care, and she said as she’s gotten older she sees this happening often. Women have their babies, and their support system gets so focused on their babies that they forget about the mom. 

She said she remembered going through all of this, and she promised herself to me as a baby that she would never let me go through it alone.  

She said, and I quote: “I promise you, I won’t forget about you.”

I’ve been crying on and off during the few days that have followed. Of course she’s coming to stay with us; my husband and I have been figuring out a good plan for her. But it just has me so emotional.

5 years ago I moved towns, at 25, after a bad breakup. He had broken up with his ex about 9 months earlier. We were working through our breakups and ended up as FWB. At the time we decided to keep it to ourselves because we didn't want things to get messy. 

A few months later, we realised we worked really well as a couple and started formally dating. Again we decided to keep it to ourselves since the relationship was fresh and we didn't want to have to explain ourselves.

Then 6 months after we moved in together. Us dating became our funny little in joke. 22 months after we bought a house together. Then a few cats. The following year we got married in secret. Our own family doesn't know we're married.

We're now coming up to our one year anniversary and we're talking about children. We've been together 4 years now in total.

We're not sure when the right time to tell our social group is, but right now we're still really enjoying the peace of a quiet life.

We are now wondering if we fake a formal engagement because the rabbit hole got too deep to explain.",6071,0.98,6071,0,6197.0,126.0,253,1741719543.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1j8yjoj/i_married_my_friend_no_one_knows/,False,True
1jtrn1d,offmychest,"I don’t miss my sister, and everyone thinks I’m grieving","My sister died a year ago. Drunk driver, middle of the night, gone instantly. She was 24. Beautiful. Kind. Everyone loved her. The golden child. The angel.

At the funeral, I gave a eulogy. People told me it was moving. They hugged me. Cried on me. Said I was so strong. So brave.

But here’s the truth I can’t say out loud:

I don’t miss her.
I don’t even feel sad.
If anything… I feel free.

My sister made my life hell. No one saw it. Not our parents, not her friends, not the teachers who adored her. She wore sweetness like armor. Like a weapon. But behind closed doors? She made me feel like nothing. Picked me apart. Made fun of my body. Told me I was stupid, weird, a burden.

She once convinced me to tell her my biggest fear just so she could use it against me later in front of people I liked. She said I was “too sensitive.” She laughed when I cried. Called me “the backup kid.” Said if I died first, she’d wear red to my funeral “because black’s too boring.”

I tried to tell people. Once. They didn’t believe me. Said she was just teasing. That she loved me. That I was imagining things.

So I shut up. Let the lie live. Let her be the saint.

And now she’s gone. And I pretend to be broken. I let people think I’m devastated. But the truth is, I sleep better. I breathe easier. There’s a quiet in my life that I never had before.

And I hate myself for feeling this way.
But I don’t wish she were still here.

And I don’t think I ever did.

EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for the support. I really appreciate it. All the comments have helped me out a lot.",5984,0.99,5984,0,6045.0,61.0,160,1744048548.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jtrn1d/i_dont_miss_my_sister_and_everyone_thinks_im/,False,True
1o9fcbf,offmychest,I'm headed for divorce but my lawyer has given me the best news ever,"My lawyer gave me the best news. My [F38] husband (soon to be ex-husband) has been cheating on me and he wants her instead of me. I'm probably naive because I didn't see this coming at all. I was researching vacation options for our 10th anniversary next year and meanwhile he [M39] was running around with another woman (she's either 25 or 27, I can't remember which). I never thought heartbreak like this was real, but he broke my heart.

I've known people who have gotten a divorce and you have to live separately for a year before you can get a divorce. But I wanted to be prepared so I made an appointment with a lawyer now. It was probably the best thing I've ever done. She told me that in our state, alimony is forbidden if there is adultery. Since my husband cheated I won't have to pay alimony. I was prepared that I would have to pay out the nose. But I have proof that he cheated (that he gave me himself) so I won't have to pay him. This was the best news I could have gotten. Also, the living separately for a year only applies to no fault divorces in my state. Since I have proof he cheated my lawyer went ahead and filed on my behalf based on adultery. Technically my husband and I still live together. Our lease expires on the 31st and the countdown on our separation was supposed to start November 1st.

I wish I could be there to see his face when 1) he gets served with notice that I filed and 2) he finds out he won't get alimony because he cheated. He wanted a no fault divorce and I know he was counting on getting alimony. It was the best news I could have gotten.

1o94386,offmychest,I found the wedding ring he never got to give me,"I (27F) lost my boyfriend (29M) last year. We were together for almost 4 years. We’d been talking about marriage, but he always joked, “Not yet I need to make it perfect.”I thought he was just stalling.We had small fights about it. I’d tease him, “If you wait too long, I’ll propose to you instead.” He’d just smile and say, “We’ll see.”He died suddenly heart failure. No warning, no nothing.

Love you always.”My birthday was two weeks after he died.I just sat there holding it, shaking, because suddenly all those “not yet” moments made sense. He was planning it. He was waiting for the right time.I didn’t open the note again for months. I couldn’t even look at the ring without crying. It’s still in that same box, but sometimes I take it out and wear it for a few minutes when I miss him too much.People tell me to move on, to start dating again. And maybe one day I will.

1luabso,offmychest,"My husband is dead, I don’t care if your friends get mad.","My (38f) husband (47m) died a week ago. Our son (6m) and I woke up and found him dead on the couch. I am not doing okay, we are not okay. 
Same day I met with my in-laws (mother, father and brother) and we all agreed we did not want a big funeral. My husband was a bit of a loaner and we decided just family and a few close friends. 
The next day my mom gets to town and I explain to her our wishes for good funeral and she said ‘my friends will get mad if they can’t come say something to you’. These are not people I know and they didn’t know my husband. I just let it go, I don’t have the fight in me right now. 
Two days go by and I’m heading to the funeral home to finalize plans and as I’m walking out of her house she says ‘make sure there is a place for me and my friends’. 
Who tf reserves sections at a funeral?!?! I know she is planning on alienating my time to show her grieving daughter off to her friends. 
Today she called to let me know that a couple of her friends will be late and she knows I don’t like one of her friends that is coming but wanted to remind me she is only nuts when she is drunk. I tried to gently tell her that I will be grieving at the funeral and am not playing host to her friends. She acted shocked that I would even say that. 
I don’t want her friends at the funeral. I don’t care if they would be mad but I think that is bs, I don’t see anyone getting mad if the family requests a private funeral. I know she is going to pull me aside to show me off to her friends to act like she’s the perfect mother but I don’t have it in me to do it this time. 


UPDATE:
The funeral starts in an hour and a half. The first hour is for only immediate family. 
A lot of great suggestions guys, I read all of them. 
Changing the date and time would have costed more money, I checked. Burying him wiped my savings and I already had to ask someone to get us groceries this week, which was completely embarrassing to me.

1i04f4g,offmychest,I caught my fiance hooking up with my sister while I’m pregnant and tomorrow I’m exposing everything at our family gathering,"I have reached the edge of what I can bear. I am 28, and have been with my fiance for just over three years. We live together with my four-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Three weeks ago, I found out I am pregnant again. At first, I was overjoyed, naive enough to think we were finally creating the stable family I had always wanted. He grew distant the very next day. He ignored my excitement, started coming home late, and kept his phone glued to him at all times.

I began noticing strange calls and those discreet social media notifications that vanish too quickly. My gut told me to investigate. I almost wish I had not. He has been secretly hooking up with my older sister behind my back. She was the one I always tolerated even though she drags drama wherever she goes. She would hug me when relatives were around, pretend to be the supportive older sibling, then turn around and badmouth me to her friends. I never imagined she would crawl into my life this deeply. It felt like a slap in the face to read their messages calling me clueless for not noticing.

He told her about the pregnancy before he was honest with me about his doubts, and they joked about how stressed I would be raising another child. My sister bragged that our entire family thinks she is the more interesting and more popular sibling. Meanwhile, I am just the quiet one who apparently deserves this. I do not know if they are still meeting in secret or if they just get a kick out of hurting me. My fiancé denies everything whenever I confront him, says I am hormonal, that my imagination is running wild. My sister keeps messaging me, telling me I should keep my mouth shut and stop being dramatic.

I am done hiding my anger. My mother wants me to talk it out calmly, but how do I fix something so broken I can barely breathe My fiancé thinks I will just accept this. He is counting on me being too shy or too pregnant to do anything. Tomorrow, I plan to blow this up in front of the entire family. We are supposed to have a casual get-together at our parents house, ironically to celebrate my pregnancy announcement. I will gather my phone logs, the screenshots, and all those humiliating texts they sent each other. Once all the relatives have settled in, I will put everything on display. No more secrets.

I might burn everything in the process. I might lose any chance of a pleasant co-parenting scenario. But I feel like I have no other way to reclaim my dignity. I have been crying nonstop for days, my nerves are shot, and all I get from my fiancé is either silent treatment or insults. My sister taunts me and acts like I am worthless. I see no reason to protect them anymore.

I do not know what happens next. Maybe they will run off together. Maybe they will lie or twist things around to make me look insane. My fiancé has not contributed much financially, so I worry about affording my daughter and this potential new baby on my own. Yet I cannot pretend everything is normal. I have to protect whatever self-respect I have left. I am going to set my entire world on fire tomorrow. Part of me feels terrified, the other part is numb. Regardless, I am done letting them tiptoe around my heart. If they want my silence, they should have kept their betrayal better hidden. Let everyone see exactly who they are. That is all I have left.",5233,0.99,5233,0,5286.0,53.0,407,1736737313.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i04f4g/i_caught_my_fiance_hooking_up_with_my_sister/,False,True
1lfm36p,offmychest,Today I was genuinely afraid of my Husband.,"We were joking around and I grabbed his phone and asked for his password, and we kind of started laughing and wrestling over it. And after a while he got me into a head lock, and said he was gonna hold me there till I either passes out or gave it back, which I also thought in the moment was a joke. And then it got tighter, and harder to breath and so I told him that I like actually couldn’t breath, and his response to that was “that’s the point”. And for a split second I thought he was still joking, until I realized he wasn’t letting go. So I gave him the phone back. But idk, it was like really scary. The fact that he would actually rather cause me physical harm than tell me the password for his phone is multiple red flags for multiple reasons. Idk tho
Update: I talked to him about it. I waited until he went back to his duty station- this happened while he was visiting me while I’m still in A school, his duty station is only a few hours from here. But I brought it up and he apologized, he said that to him it just seemed like we were wrestling the way we always do and that he hadn’t realized he was doing it that tightly, he told me he felt ashamed that he put me in a position where I was scared of him even if for just a moment.",5002,0.98,5002,0,5106.0,104.0,682,1750367225.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lfm36p/today_i_was_genuinely_afraid_of_my_husband/,False,True
1hc3n18,offmychest,I turned in my partner to the police after discovering his Reddit and X accounts. ,"He had disturbing accounts on other social media platforms, all of them listed under ""consensual incest"". However, the material he was peddling and the conversations he was having with individuals included the exchange (for money) of CP, as well as encouraging individuals to engage in sexual behaviors with children. 

I have known this man since I was 16 (we are currently 50) and have loved him all that time. Forgiven him for countless transgressions against me and always ended up coming back, but this was a bridge too far. I feel unclean. As if my whole life and every moment I've invested in this man was just cover for him to continue with this sick and demented behavior. 

I feel guilty for how long this had gone on while I just whistled through the graveyard - knowing something was wrong, but not being willing to admit to myself how wrong, or ""lower"" myself by snooping. But finally... I had to... and I did. What I found... destroyed me. I used my own phone to take video of his phone screen while I scrolled through account after account, conversation after conversation, video after video, image after image... then I went to the police station and handed it over to detectives. I was later informed that there was already an investigation into those accounts, they just didn't know his name. I gave them what they needed to arrest him on the spot. He'll probably never leave jail. 

I don't think I will ever feel clean again. I can feel the stain on my soul like a giant black hole, eating me from the inside - destined to consume me completely. I guess we're both in prisons of our own making...

Thank you for letting me vent. 

Update: Just in case anyone is still paying attention. My ex was transported from the jail to the hospital after collapsing and losing consciousness yesterday. He underwent emergency surgery for a perforated bowel and sepsis. Turns out he has stage 4 colon cancer. They had to remove about 50% of his colon and some additional portions of his small intestine that were being strangled by the tumors. He's now on life support, but fading. Maybe he'll save the taxpayers some money and let go. 

Last update: He died on 12/30/2024 after his family decided to terminate life support. After I went to the jail to pick up his personal belongings. In those belongings I found letters, notarized letters, accusing me of making false claims deliberately in order to fraudulently take control of his possessions while he was incarcerated. Also, authorizing some random stranger to enter my home and take possession of EVERYTHING while I was in custody for fraud/theft, leaving me homeless, car-less, and without even clothing or access to money. Every molecule of grief or guilt that I was carrying fell away at that moment. I'm glad he's dead, a tiny part of me actually wishes I could claim responsibility for ending his life because at least it wouldn't be passive... Anyway, hopefully he's rotting in hell and watching myself and his third wife living happily together.

By the grace of God he woke from his coma three days later abd walked out with minor injuries.  

Seeing his lifeless greyish/blue body swinging back and forth from our two dogs jumping up and pawing him.

1i7gc83,offmychest,I deactivated all of my social media…. Because something bad is coming,"I just want to start this post off by saying that I am not a conspiracy theorist. Because I know it may seem rash to deactivate all of my social media apps but let me explain. I live in the US (That may be explanation enough for some of you). I have always been the kind of person to “just know things”; like waking up at the time of death of several people in my life and knowing someone just died, or blurting out phrases that are about to be said, or saying “something bad is about to happen” when I get a *feeling* and then something bad actually happening. All this being said, I’d like to add that I’m neurodivergent and have intense pattern recognition and I am extremely inuitive. I’ve learned to trust my gut because so far it has never steered me wrong, not in my 31 years of life. I also am an extremely rational person and very analytical; I don’t jump to conclusion until I have irrefutable proof.
I’m sure a lot of the world was watching as the US swore in a felon to be our president on Monday (MLK day here in the states, which is a HUGE deal here in the states as Dr. King played a pivotal role in our country’s seperation from and expulsion of segregation). A lot of us watched (some chose to boycott and I really don’t blame you) as a failed businessman took the highest office in our nation with 3 of the 8 weathliest people on our planet stood on stage with him and smiled and cheered along side of him while he invalidated the existance of trans people. He also declared a national emergency at our boarders, effectively locking us inside of our own country. And on top of it all, while a largely populated area of our country is LITERALLY BURNING, he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord and withdrew from WHO… And for those of you that know world history and also have intense pattern ecognition, I know you know exactly whom the actions are akin to. And further affirming that, the Muskrat, a former apartheid South African citizen, gave a “heil h!tler” salute, not once but twice, ON LIVE TELEVISION. And now those clips are being scrubbed from the internet. Those 3 wealthy people that sat on that stage, Musktrat included, control some of the biggest forms of information and communication in this country; Alexa, X (twitter), Facebook, Threads and Instagram. Already there is information being altered or simply being scrubbed entirely. I know I am certainly not the only one aware of this.

Let me get into what I *feel* is coming. ‘Life immitates art’ or something like that… and what I am witnessing in the US is life immitating the beginning of the Handmaids Tale. While I don’t think what happened in its entirety in that show is going to happen here, I can see a lot of what happened pre Gilead on that show is already happening here. And I truly believe that something nefarious this way comes. After browsing on the above mentioned socail media apps, after watching the inauguration, after endlessly watching various news sources and reading news articles, I *feel* that social media is going to be used as a tool to persecute anyone that has opposed the FOTUS. I *feel* it is going to be used to destroy and dismantle the lives of immigrants, POC, the LGBTQIA+ community, and women. I don’t exactly know how, but I have the worst gut feeling right now and I just wanted to share these thoughts just in case anyone else is maybe feeling the same. I really didn’t want to make this post super long but I do have a lot more I could have added to support my feeling. 
And after all of this being said, I’m not saying this *is* going to happen, I just have a feeling; maybe not something super extreme, but certainly no good can come from these men having absolute domain over our modern aged, technology driven, social lives. 
Heed my warning, or don’t; but if you belong to any of the demographics I mentioned, please just be mindful and careful about what you post on the those apps. I know this is a time to speak up and stand against this regime, and for some of us, social media is the only tool we have at our disposal, but I would hate for my feeling to be right. Just stay vigilant. Trust your own instincts. Hopefully I see you all in 2029!!

EDIT: I have seen quite a few people accuse me of fear mongering… I assure you that was not the intent of the post. I just needed to get this feeling and these thoughts off of my chest, as the subreddit is intended for. I’m not going to engage with those saying I’m fear mongering so let me just leave you wih the definition of it as seen in the Oxford dictionary
*noun: fear-mongering
the action of deliberately arousing public fear or alarm about a particular issue.*
The key word being ‘deliberately’. Expressing my concern as a woman in this country is not fear mongering… I’m afraid that’s what the FOTUS has done to those on the far right… you know, like when he claimed trans people are going to go into public bathrooms with your children, or I don’t know, ‘god forbid’ a drag queen read to childen… you know, *imaginary* issues…

One more thing, some people are telling me to “seek help” or that I need “psychiatric help”… 🤦🏻‍♀️ not that I need to explain to you all…. But who do you think diagnosed me as neurodivergent? Perhaps my… therapist? /s
I suggest maybe you’d benefit from seeking help yourself since you feel the need to degrade strangers on the internet instead actually productively contributing to the conversation.",4600,0.87,4600,0,5408.0,808.0,725,1737566331.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i7gc83/i_deactivated_all_of_my_social_media_because/,False,True
1l5fkcg,offmychest,My mom and sister starved themselves to death because of my moms psychosis,"TW: mental illness, death, trauma, suicide, crime scene 

And I have to deal with the aftermath 

In 2020 my mom and sister died together in a locked apartment - along with my mom’s friend.
They didn’t die in an accident or from illness.
They starved themselves to death.
Together.
In the middle of summer.

My mother had developed paranoid schizophrenia, but the diagnosis came post mortem, on my request, in desperation to get some answers. She believed my father was trying to harm them and isolated herself and my sister from everyone. For 1.5 years, they lived in fear, completely cut off.
She also believed they could survive without food and water by “absorbing energy from the universe.” Her mental illness spiraled into something so extreme, she convinced my sister to follow her. And she did.

They were found about five days after death but the police has no exact day of their deaths because of course they did not die at the same exact time but hours or days from one another.
Three bodies, actually – my mother, my sister, and a delusional friend of hers who died with them.
By the time they were discovered, they were in such a decomposed state that the police couldn’t even identify which body was whose. Not even by hair. That’s how bad it was. We had to run DNA testing, dental records.
3 dead bodies in the heat, locked in, door barricaded 
I wasn’t there – but my mind was, and still is.

I’ve never read the police reports. I’ve never visited the place where their ashes are. I still can’t believe they’re gone. And I feel this weird, almost sick obsession with the grotesque details. The smell, the state of their bodies, what the forensic team saw. Sometimes I google crime scenes or morgue cases because my mind is stuck there. I imagine what it looked like. I can’t stop imagining it.

I’ve built a life. I’ve run my own business. I’ve survived.
But I get triggered by things like rotting fruit.
The smell. The texture. It all sends my body into panic.
People ask me about my family, and I smile and lie.
They joke about “crazy people” and I laugh along.
I’ve never told my clients. I’ve never written this down before.
But it lives in me.

I feel guilty.
For not saving them.
For the trauma the police and forensic workers had to endure.
For my sister – who was 29, and could’ve walked away, but didn’t.
And sometimes, I just feel nothing.
Just this heavy silence.

If anyone else out there has lived through the kind of trauma you can’t put into words…
If you’ve ever wanted to scream and vanish and be held, all at once –
I see you.

Thank you for reading this. I don’t know what I want from it.
Maybe just to not hold it alone anymore.


EDIT: posting this has been one of the most healing things in my grieving process!! I had no idea it would be such a relief to be able to share my story and getting so much support! It hurts that some people might not believe that the story is true, maybe it just shows how horrible the events were and how it must be hard for anyone to process the case. Trust me on this- the police were so empathetic and equally shocked that something like this can find place. There is no way anyone could have prevented this during the pandemic. Also- yes, I got help from AI to put into words what happened to me and my feelings. Dont blame me for that.

Thank you so so Much for all your kind words and sharing YOUR stories. I hope this post will be a safe space for us to share and vent in- and be a memory of my loved ones who dont suffer anymore❤️

I have read every single comment of yours ❤️

EDIT 2: one of the most healing things for me after posting this was: I have finally found peace finding out that there is an actual concept called folié de deux, which is shared madness or shared delusion, even if only one person is suffering from actual paranoia and psychosis, it can spread on to others under right and unfortunate conditions. It makes me stop questioning things and finally finding peace with how and what happened. Thank you very much to those who brought this up to clarify and help me answer the biggest questions of them all: WHY 

EDIT 3: I am still totally in shock how many people have read my story but mostly - how many of you are saying that I am a very strong person… it’s very kind, so reassuring, even though I don’t feel like that. I had no choice. I knew if I let this break me, it would ruin my business, my life and my future. I had no choice than keep on working, keep on pretending like everything is ok to my clients ❤️
Also I am deeply touched that my story is spreading like rings in the water resulting in people being inspired to share their own stories, to open up, to live life more consciously and appreciate more. I had no idea that Reddit could be such a healing place ❤️❤️❤️ sending all my love to all of you who have reached out, I will respond ❤️❤️",4587,0.99,4587,0,4634.0,47.0,271,1749283242.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l5fkcg/my_mom_and_sister_starved_themselves_to_death/,False,True
1lj10cc,offmychest,I lied about drinking coffee at work. No one can find out.,"I work in a costumer facing position. For the entire time I've worked here I've drank water out of a coffee thermos that's from a local coffee shop. The logo and name for the coffee shop is printed clearly on the thermos. I got it for free from when I worked at the coffee shop for a couple months a few years ago. The coffee shop has a deal if you go in with one of these thermoses you get a discount refill. 

However, I don't like coffee and I've always filled up with water because it keeps the water nice and cold, and it looks nicer than having a plastic disposable water bottle in front of customers. You can't actually see what I'm drinking. 

Some time after I started working here a coworker made a joke about me being too good for the free coffee we have back in the employee break room. And that I must be a die hard fan of the coffee shop cuz I only ever get it there. I kind of leaned into the joke without revealing it's just water. Now it's sort of become a thing around the office that I get a big refill in the morning and come back with another refill after my lunch break and that I love coffee only from this coffee shop. 

Last Christmas and for my birthday I was given gift cards to this coffee shop. I was very grateful because the place is a bit pricey. I spent them on pastries and breakfast sandwiches and filled my thermos up at the water fountain. I also got a sock monkey mug with hot chocolate supplies which I genuinely love and use at home.

My boss's boss from out of state came in at one point with a chain brand coffee and saw me drinking out of my thermos and asked if they were good. I said they were the best and (jokingly) it's the only way to survive in this place. They laughed and I laughed. Introductions were made. We shook hands. It was good. 

I've recently gotten a promotion and a pay raise and I am pretty sure my pretend love of coffee has something to do with it. My boss drinks coffee throughout the entire day and we've chatted about what the best roast is. I bullsh*t my way through the entire conversation. And how there's probably something wrong with people who prefer tea. She said I'm reliable and always ready to take on whatever the day gives me ""just as long as you've had your morning cup!"".

I imagine this is what people who smoke cigarettes together feel like. Or when everyone's drinking beer at a party. Like some kind of teamwork building exercise. Community bonding.

But I don't like coffee. I don't even really like tea. I just like cold water. But I pretend. I'll have to take this to my grave. ",4481,0.99,4481,0,4527.0,46.0,90,1750736431.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lj10cc/i_lied_about_drinking_coffee_at_work_no_one_can/,False,True
1ifd80i,offmychest,I just found out why everyone at work gives me a certain look,"Hey guys. So I was working out yesterday with my coworker (hitting up chest and shoulders) when he brought up something that I found very fucking funny.

For context I’m a regional manager, so I go from site to site to site, week to week and because of that I’m only at a particular building 3 times a month, so I’m not given enough time to build any real rapport with a lot of my coworkers.

Anyways, my friend from work told me that basically all of my other coworkers, which is mostly women, they 100% believe that for some reason I’m a single dad taking care of my kid and that my wife left us and I’m raising my kid single-handedly and that my wife apparently was a cutie who turned to the lifestyle of meth and that they all feel super bad for me.

I have absolutely no idea where this came from. I’ve never been married and I don’t have any kids so I think the idea that they think this is hilarious.

I think I’m gonna not correct anyone and just continue to roll with it because I feel like that makes me look like a super standup dude. But anyways, that explains why all of the girls at work look at me of this like sort of sad eye. That’s about it. I just thought it was funny and wanted to tell somebody about it.

My ex and I broke up three years ago. It was mutual, no drama, just different paths. His mom and I were really close though. She used to call me her “bonus daughter.”

Yesterday, I ran into her at the grocery store. She looked shocked for a second, then just walked over and hugged me. Like really hugged me, the kind that breaks through your walls before you can stop it.

She said, “You were good for him, and you were good for me too.”

I almost cried right there in the produce aisle. We talked for ten minutes, just catching up on life. She said she still prays for me every night.

1m2lggi,offmychest,I no longer have a sister,"Throwaway. I (31F) have a 9 year old daughter. My older sister has a 14 year old son. Our kids got along until my nephew's father passed away 2 years ago. He's still a kid but he's kind of an ass. His mom lets him get away with anything in the name of ""grief"". My nephew is definitely taking advantage of it.

We all went to check in on my mom today after she had a fall. My daughter loves to knit and she's quite good at it. She brought along her latest project, a personalized backpack she completed a couple of days ago, to show to her grandmother. She has been working on it for weeks from the design to the final product and planned to enter it into a competition with a big cash prize this weekend. I spent a small fortune on yarn and the end result was so worth it. My daughter planned to use the prize money to pay for a school trip we otherwise couldn't afford. I'm very proud of my resourceful girl. 

Well, my nephew set the bag on fire. My daughter refused to give it to him, so he decided to get back at her by destroying it. When confronted, he blamed my daughter and my sister of course made excuses for him. I demanded that she reimburse my daughter for the yarn and her labour, but she refused despite being able to afford it. She said the bag had no value because ""a kid made it"". Nevermind that she was fawning over it when she first saw it. She knows damn well how lovely it was.

My daughter is absolutely gutted. There isn't enough time to make another one and the comments my sister made cut her deeply. I'm heartbroken for my girl. She has lost both her work and the school trip. My sister and her son can go to hell. My nephew is headed down a very dark path and his mom is allowing it.

1i1q3du,offmychest,UPDATE: I exposed my fiancé and sister's betrayal at the family gathering,"I am still reeling from what happened. After writing my last post, I spent hours debating with myself about whether I should really go through with exposing them at our family gathering. A part of me was scared I would turn my whole life upside down forever. But I knew I couldn’t keep letting them walk all over me while pretending everything was fine. I called my mom beforehand to let her know I was breaking up with him and to prepare her.

When I arrived at my parents' house, everyone was already there, including my ex-fiancé and my sister. My mother tried to pull me aside, whispering that we should talk first. I stayed calm, walked straight into the living room where everyone was sitting, and asked them to listen. They looked confused. My sister immediately rolled her eyes, and my fiancé mumbled something, probably hoping I would stay silent.

I started reading the most shocking parts of the messages I found between the two of them. They mocked me, joked about me not noticing anything, and said I deserved this. I had timestamps proving he was sneaking around with my own sister while I was at home with my daughter. My sister stood up and accused me of lying, her voice defensive and low-pitched. But I just kept reading. The messages spoke for themselves.

I revealed how he told her about my pregnancy before even discussing it with me and how they laughed about me being stressed raising another child. My fiancé tried to dismiss me, claiming I was overreacting and misinterpreting the situation because of my ""emotional, pregnant"" state. He even blamed my mental health. By then, he stormed out of the room, and my sister started crying. My dad stared at the floor, silent, while my mother looked horrified. Finally, my sister snapped and stormed out, yelling that I was a dramatic liar who blew everything out of proportion.

Now the fallout begins. My fiancé, or rather, my ex-fiancé, has been texting me nonstop. One moment, he says he is sorry; the next, he blames me for humiliating him. He shows zero genuine remorse. He is just mad that I exposed him. My sister calls me horrendous names, says I ruined her image, and refuses to take responsibility. She insists I am making up drama.

Honestly, I do not even know if they are still seeing each other or blaming each other for being caught. Either way, their secret is out, and that is all I wanted. I am now talking to a lawyer because this man barely contributed financially before. I have to protect my daughter and ensure I never have a child with him. Only the thought of raising two kids alone is terrifying.

I feel numb and heartbroken at times, but I also feel a strange sense of relief. At least everyone knows the truth now. I exposed everything that day in the living room, but at least I am no longer being trampled on in silence. My sister and ex-fiancé can no longer laugh behind my back.

Yes, things will probably get messy. They might lie to other relatives, people we mutually know, or twist the story. But I am glad I refused to keep quiet. All I can do now is focus on the positive, talk to my lawyer, and move forward. It will be painful, but I will do everything in my power to build a new future on my own terms, far away from these people.",4379,0.98,4379,0,4470.0,91.0,209,1736917244.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i1q3du/update_i_exposed_my_fiancé_and_sisters_betrayal/,False,True

1jtj1g8,offmychest,Found out my boyfriend was a cheating scum when I rushed him to the ER.,"Throwaway. 
I’m beyond heartbroken and angry. My longtime boyfriend had an accident at home and broke a few bones…when we got to the hospital he was so out of it he gave me his phone pin (guarded that phone like it was the Crown Jewels) because my phone had died.

Asian dating, local hookups, finding women overseas, messages kept coming from all those apps and sites.So many porn and streaming sites…but what sent me over the edge was the texts and emails and videos with other women.

The pics they’d taken on Valentine’s Day, the quick vacations where he was supposedly taking care of his family, declarations of love and lust going back years.

Women he’d told me not to worry about, they’re just friends, one lost her parents and was having a hard time, another wanted help figuring out to sell her home, you know the excuses.

He’d told me I was ridiculous, paranoid, acting like a controlling witch. But I could feel it…he’d stopped hugging me, touching me and blamed it on the stress of having to take care of his handicapped mom. All while proclaiming he loved me sooo much, calling me the same sweet nicknames (the ones he used with the others as well, btw). Even talked about wanting to get married (brought that up with one of the others as well, which destroyed me).

Now he’s in the hospital and I can just stare at his lying fucking cheating face in that bed…he may not remember when he wakes up that I told him he’s wasted my time and my love and that I hate him more than anything on this earth and this will be the last time he sees me in this life.

But the one thing I did do is use his phone to message all of the other women he’d been romancing, texting/sexting, telling them how sexy they are and how good they make him feel, oh baby I’m ready to have a real relationship because you’re the only one I want…and told them what he’s done, that he’s more than a piece of shit stained trash, he’s the whole fucking dumpster.

Took pics and sent myself a lot of the evidence before I unfollowed, blocked, and deleted every last trace of myself and us from his phone. I don’t want to ever forget how he’s treated me, so I won’t even think about forgiveness. 
I lost my best friend.

Now I’m sitting and looking out the window, waiting for sunrise and a new day to unfold, and wondering why, WHY he sucks so much and makes me feel like I’m not enough. I know I am…but I don’t know if I’ll ever trust anyone with my heart again.

1lqii46,offmychest,Witnessed the death of a small child today.,"Today I was sitting on the couch when I heard a very loud thud. In my building, people often drop/throw things from their balconies to the rooftop patio below, so it wasn’t uncommon to hear something thud to the ground. But today the noise was SO loud. My immediate thought was that I hope it wasn’t someone’s pet or child. I had a friends pet fall to its death from a balcony, so it was my immediate thought. I got off the couch to check. It was a little child, about 4/5, laying there, unmoving. 

I don’t think I’ll ever get that image out of my head. Or the sound. Called police immediately, and had to describe the child. It was very clear he fell from high up, and was dead. Police came quick and they covered the scene up immediately.

They’re still outside now, with a tent now over the body. I had to make a statement to a detective, and they advised me they will be outside taking photos of the scene etc. I can hear them talking. Ran myself a bath and all I could hear while it ran was the sound of sirens, even though it’s been hours since they got here. 

I feel devastated for the family, but also angry. The balconies here are chest high, so the child would have had to climb or have something near the balcony to climb on and over. Ugh. Please hold your kids tightly and make sure they are safe. This should never ever happen.

1ncvct0,offmychest,I had to reject a candidate at work today and I can't stop crying,"I've been crying on and off for hours because of something that happened at work, and I just feel the need to tell someone.

I'm in my mid 20s, software engineer in the UK, and part of my job is interviewing people. Today, my coworker and I interviewed a candidate for a relatively junior role at our company. The man we interviewed was in his late 30s, had 8 years of experience, and had recently moved here from another country. He's currently unemployed.

During the interview, he really struggled with a fundamental problem. It wasn't a trick question. I found myself giving him hint after hint, trying to guide him toward the solution. He did eventually get there and got his code to work at the very end, but it was a real struggle and he was very slow.

Professionally, it was a clear ""no hire."" My coworker agreed. We both knew that if he joined our team, he would be under immense pressure and would likely struggle a lot. It would have been cruel to put him in that position.

But I feel absolutely gutted. This man, more than decade older than me, is in a new country, jobless, and is trying so hard that he's applying for junior roles despite his years of experience. And I was the one who had to deliver the 'no' that will make his life harder. I keep replaying the interview in my mind. He got the code working at the end, so he probably left with a little bit of hope. The age difference just makes it feel worse.

I know it's just a job and I did what I was supposed to do. But I feel like I've kicked someone who is already down. My heart just breaks for him, and I haven't been able to stop crying.

He was only 20 years old. He was doing everything right—going the speed limit had his helmet and his gear, being cautious—when someone turned in front of him at an intersection because they were distracted. He didn’t make it.

The person who hit him is 18. And because they’re “young,” want to go to college, and have a “future ahead of them,” the court gave them just one year of probation and 100 hours of community service. That’s all. No jail time. No real accountability.

He was kind. So deeply kind and caring to me and to everyone around him. He worked hard every day and was saving up so he could go to college too. He had dreams, goals, plans—and now he’s gone.

Im not kidding, she will suck it down like it's liquid crack. I get it, I'm from the south. We love our sweet tea here. I love it.

That's why I got sick of coming home from the brutal heat and humidity to find an empty jug of sweet tea. A jug that I just bought the day before. I jug which would last me at least a week, maybe more.

So I bought one jug of unsweetened iced tea, drank it, and then filled it back up with sweet tea. She won't touch unsweetened. I like it, but she, like most southerners, treat it like it's poison.

That jug lasted me a week and a half, so I kept doing it. I love having a tall glass of ice cold sweet tea when I get home. I have one every day. I love not getting surprised by an empty jug, or a jug with like one shot glass worth of tea put BACK IN THE FRIDGE, which feels insulting. Just drink the last little slurp! Don't leave it for me like you're doing me a favor!

I told her I switched for health reasons and she has to buy her own sweet tea when she wants some from now on.

1hlyyvt,offmychest,Tonight my boyfriend beat me to the point I thought I was going to die.,"Tonight I 28(f) and my 30(M) boyfriend were drinking to celebrate Christmas. I was having a good time, and we started wrapping presents. When I seen his phone, and saw pictures of a girls butt. I confronted him, and said I deserved an explanation. He finally told me 2 days ago he was texting a girl I always had an off feeling about, and got nudes from her. I started crying obv, and he kept asking for his keys which I wouldn't hand over because he was very drunk. I told him sleep in the bedroom, and I'd sleep on the couch. He could leave tomorrow. 

He woke up randomly bc i kept going about my night. He was looking for the bottle of alcohol in the fridge and ripped everything apart completely. Alcohol spilled everywhere, he ripped trash out of the trash can. It was a disaster. He then tried cleaning the floor with lysol disinfectant spray you spray the air with. I tried redirecting him to a different cleaner bc we have animals. Lysol is very toxic to animals. 

That's when it started. He grabbed me in a chokehold from behind and choked me til I almost blacked out. I immediately grabbed my phone and started recording just in case. 
He hit me in my face multiple times so hard my ears began ringing. He then proceeded to choke me two more times, and spit in my face. 
I know he was blackout bc he began talking about how ""I died in Vietnam, and all my friends did b!tch!!"" And how i put him in jail for 2 days. (This was the first ever violent episode in our relationship ever.) He apparently got me mixed up with his ex girlfriend. 

I finally escaped, and called my dad, then his sister. His sister instructed me to call the police immediately, and she'd start driving to me. I called the police and he was arrested after I showed them the 13 minute long video of him beating me. As he got into the car, (I had his sister on the phone) he screamed ""Call your dad, and have him get you the fuck out of my house."" 
The lease has both our names on it. 

His sister got me from the police station after my statement, and took me to the hospital. I'm okay, and have a minor head injury. 

I'm so scared now. Idk what's next for me. I have no car. He controlled out finances so my car wound up getting reposed. Idk how I'll get to my job now. &amp; part of me is feeling bad he's going to wake up in jail, completely unaware of what happened. His sister is convinced he has severe psychosis going on that was triggered from the alcohol (which is no excuse) 

Merry Christmas. Am I right?

1i9sfai,offmychest,My stepmom reported my boyfriend to ICE. He’s an American citizen but his dad is not.,"No politics please. His dad is legally here and has a green card. His mom is an American but my stepmom is racist and bc she’s not white she doesn’t think any of my bfs family are.  I’m losing my mind. My dad and stepmom are in their 40s and have been together since I was like 12? I’m 18 now and a senior in high school. I live with my bf and his parents right now. My mom isn’t around and my dad and stepmom kicked me out when I turned 18. 

But her son still lives there and he’s 20. They have a few more kids. She’s never liked me and my dad is a weakass punk. I feel bad for thinking her son is a loser but he does nothing all day but play video games. I’m a straight A student and have a scholarship for next year, I have a job as well. I feel bad I think my stepbro is a loser because he called me and said that his mom was laughing and telling her friends she called ICE on Tuesday to report my bf and his family. You know? The only reason I’m not homeless right now. And they’re all here legally but because they’re Hispanic and speak Spanish to one another (never her!) they must not be true Americans. I broke down and told my bf and he said everything will be ok but I’m just devastated that I brought this on them. It’s all my fault and all they’ve done is take care of me. I just hope this doesn’t make them mad enough that he breaks up with me and they kick me out. They’re nice people but they could always decide I’m not worth the trouble. 

I want to call DFCS on them. I want them to suffer and have a govt agency up their ass. My bf and his family have all their paperwork and carry copies of it now. They shouldn’t have to. It’s all because of me. 

Edit: you don’t need to tell me to go no contact with them. My stepmom celebrated never having to talk to me again when they kicked me out, literally posted a million family pictures over the holidays with her family. I’ve tried contacting dad about trying to get like my like birth certificate and social security card and to see if I’m still covered under his health insurance but he won’t respond.

1hjr9gr,offmychest,"As a child, I took a nap that cost my parents over $1,500","When I was around 4 years old, I used to spend my days with my babysitter and her daughter. I don't remember much about that time, but I'll never forget this particular day.

I remember the daughter and I were playing in the backyard and it was getting close to nap time. I really didn't want to stop playing to take a boring nap. When the mom called out to us to tell us to come inside, I laid down on the swing (my stomach was on the swing, with my arms and legs hanging down) and pretended to be unconscious. I remember the mom calling my name a few times before she came outside.  I don't remember her reaction or anything she said, I only remember telling myself to stay still, don't laugh, just pretend I'm already asleep. My thought process was that if she thought I was already sleeping, she'd leave me alone, go inside, and I'd continue playing. 

The next thing I remember was lying on my back with strangers around me, whom I knew to be ""ambulances"" (my 4-year-old word for EMTs/Paramedics). At this point I was so afraid of how much trouble I'd be in if they knew the truth, so I had to keep up the ruse. I just concentrated on not moving or opening my eyes.

My next recollection was riding in the back of the ambulance. The EMT was about to give me a shot. This is when I ""woke up"". I told him not to give me the shot. He showed me a bandaid with scooby doo or mickey mouse or something on it. He asked if I wanted that bandaid, I said yes. He said I had to let him give me the shot then. I don't remember if I got the shot or not.

The last thing I remember was lying on the hospital bed with my mom sitting on the chair next to me, crying. The doctor came in and... said stuff. I really don't remember, but probably saying there was nothing wrong with me. 

I put my parents through hell, just because I didn't want to take a nap. And what makes it worse, I did take a nap while lying in the hospital bed.",3995,0.99,3995,0,4036.0,41.0,168,1734842043.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hjr9gr/as_a_child_i_took_a_nap_that_cost_my_parents_over/,False,True
1krugy4,offmychest,I Hate what Ozempic has Done to my Partner,"My partner jumped on the Ozempic trend about 2 years ago. She was not prescribed by her doctor and is not diabetic nor was she obese. She was going to the gym to lose weight, and because (I'm paraphrasing the best I can from memory) she did not want her attractiveness to be defined by her legs or butt. She decided to go on the drug after her weight loss began plateauing.

She was upfront to me about going on the drug, for the reasons, and I was supportive.

Now, 2 years later with the drug in full effect, she is not satisfied. She is upset that her butt is now flat. She's frustrated that her skin is wrinkly. Her doctor has told her that she has lost muscle mass. She looks gaunt, and it has effected our sex life. She never goes to the gym.

But she has a ""healthy BMI"" now, which makes it all worth it to her. She is also deep(ER) in debt as she has been going out of pocket for the drug and has gone from being able to put a bit of money in savings each month to playing whack-a-mole with bills. She makes six figures.

It all seems like a net-negative after 2 years, but she's intent on staying on the drug and has begun a maintenance dose.

We don't live together nor share finances, and she's not a bad person, but I am so uncomfortable and I want to leave. I'm trying not to.",3973,0.97,3973,0,4100.0,127.0,258,1747823339.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1krugy4/i_hate_what_ozempic_has_done_to_my_partner/,False,True

1htlic0,offmychest,i partly blame my parents for my brother’s death.,"in 2009 my 11 year old brother got very sick. starting around August/September, he started vomiting for no apparent reason. it continued getting worse and worse until he literally could not eat anything and what came out was just bile and water. he was emitting several times a day. an 11 year old. bile and water.

my mom took off a lot of time from work to stay home with him but that was really it. no hospital, no doctor, no tests. nothing until DECEMBER. he was diagnosed with late stage cancer on the 17th and was dead on May 22nd of 2010. in those 5 months, the tumors didn’t even shrink. they didn’t respond AT ALL to the heavy chemo and radiation. the poor kid was basically tortured needlessly and died anyway.

what kills me is that he had Burkitt’s Lymphoma. the survival rate for that is 80%. yes, 80% of people with this type of cancer live. my brother didn’t because my parents just didn’t fucking care enough to take him somewhere and get some answers as soon as something was wrong. instead they waited MONTHS. and now my mother has the gall to say that “he was only meant to be on this earth for 11 years. that was God’s plan”. fuckin ass.

i’m angry guys. i know it’s been 15 years but he would be 26 now and he would be so amazing. but we lost that because of sheer negligence. someone tell me i’m not totally crazy for being this full of rage.",3939,1.0,3939,0,,,95,1736017174.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1htlic0/i_partly_blame_my_parents_for_my_brothers_death/,False,True
1j1keej,offmychest,I confronted my husband about housework and he left me and I couldn't be happier,"After years and years of fighting about housework, I gave my husband an ultimation: get his act together, or leave. 

He left. 

I was not expecting that.  But he said it was clear I didn't respect him, and he could never be with a woman who didn't respect him.  He moved into the spare room for a few months, and then moved in with another woman.  The speed with which that happened suggests the 'other woman' was not a new thing, although he maintains that they were 'just friends' prior to our separation.  Apparently she made a move as soon as he was free - or at least, that's his story.  

My reaction?  \*Whatever\*. 

When I met his new girlfriend, rather than feeling resentful or jealous, I wanted to hug her, and thank her for taking him off my hands. 

Also, she's very pretty, which people seem to think should make me feel worse, but actually makes me feel better.  A part of me is like: at least I kept him for a while, despite the competition!

The property settlement is a bit more tense.  I have been the primary income earner and care giver throughout the relationship, and I will continue to have primary care of the kids.  He nonetheless asked for half of everything - citing his future needs and all. 

I don't know whether he was expecting me to fight or get angry, but I just agreed, put the house on the market and sold the shares to give him half, and we're working through some other stuff, mainly because of legal complexity rather than apportionment. I have moved into a three bedroom apartment with the kids, with a dog park down the block.  No pool, no yard, food on the doorstep and no need for a car.  The kids and I have time to enjoy being together, and without dad around, we can do our own thing. 

It's wonderful. 

I feel so guilty for feeling so good.

He is the only man who I have ever dated.  The only man I have ever even kissed.  After so many years of marriage, good times and bad, and our beautiful children, I keep thinking I should be hurt.  I should cry or scream or at least feel \*bad\*.  But I actually feel relieved.  Nothing but relieved. 

(Well, I do feel bad for the kids - divorced parents are not ideal, and I have to deal with some passing guilt about that.  But not enough to change my mind that this is the right decision). 

I know my reaction seems strange.  Maybe there is something wrong with me.  Maybe I was just never invested enough in this relationship to begin with.  Maybe I don't really know how to love.  

But at least I now finally know happiness, and that's a wonderful thing. ",3931,0.99,3931,0,3971.0,40.0,117,1740896268.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1j1keej/i_confronted_my_husband_about_housework_and_he/,False,True
1iwan4q,offmychest,I cheated on my husband and I do not regret it at all.,"I got married at 20 to an amazing man. I don’t think he could have been more perfect at the time— no red flags at all.

A month after we got married, he went on his first military deployment. While he was deployed, we would talk about how we wanted to try to conceive a child as soon as he came back, so that’s what we did and I actually got pregnant really quickly upon his return. Unfortunately, when he came back from his deployment, he was a completely different person. My first sign of this was when I told him I was pregnant. Since this was planned, I expected him to be excited. After I shared the news with him, he pretended he was going to hug me and then body slammed me instead. Then called my dad and told him what he did.

I endured this for 2 more years. My breaking point was when he choked me until I went unconscious and started bleeding from the mouth while I was breastfeeding my daughter, all because he was upset I said good morning while he was playing Call of Duty and his mic wasn’t muted.

When I came to, I called the police, and called my parents to pick me up. I stayed gone for 3 years and then went back like a dummy after my dad passed away. I thought he had changed but he just started back up again after he felt like he had me where he needed me.

I attempted to leave again multiple times again after that, but was unsuccessful. He was a narcissist and I had undiagnosed BPD at the time. Though I wasn’t yet diagnosed, I figured that in order for me to leave and stay gone, I needed to move on with someone else. So, that’s what I did. I knew that i needed a new favorite person before I even understood what a favorite person was.

I started dating my high school sweetheart. We fell in love again really quickly and it helped me to leave my abusive ex husband. And then my high school sweetheart died suddenly  (which is either my karma or some sick joke sky daddy played on me, idk). But by the time of his death, I had already left my ex husband. And it honestly saved my life because I’ve had multiple brushes with death— the last one being my ex husband choking me in front of our two children and telling them he was going to go to prison for killing me and they’d have to go to foster care, while he was doing it.

So yea, cheating is bad in general. But, I cheated. Don’t regret it. Not sorry. It’s the reason I’m alive.

My ex husband did kind of catch me cheating. And he cried. I still felt no remorse. I actually wanted to laugh. But I didn’t laugh because I didn’t want him to kill me.

It hurt knowing that after putting my body and health through hell for nine months, he no longer wants to touch me. He said ""there comes a point in pregnancy and after birth, where you no longer find it attractive""

The worst thing is I already knew. I could tell by the way he looked at me, the way his kisses changed, the lessening of physical affection.

He says his libido had decreased after becoming a parent, but he didn't know why. Then after we were intimate on Valentines Day, he realised that it was because he no longer finds me sexually attractive.

My friends are outraged for me, but I'm not angry because you can't help how you feel.

Things changed after COVID. He went from holding down a factory job to be constantly under/unemployed at restaurants and gas stations, content to contribute $200/month to the household budget.

1j27x5r,offmychest,I’m visiting the US for the first time and it’s made me so grateful that I was born in Europe,"I don’t mean to insult any Americans who read this. During my travels I’ve come across plenty of people who have been very friendly and I am glad to have had to chance to meet them. However, the US is far from what I expected and I just had to get it off my chest.

Everybody knows the US is the richest, most powerful country on the planet - the epicentre of the western world. However, after a couple weeks here I can honestly say you would never know it by looking at it. Even many European countries with far smaller GDPs like Slovakia, Hungary, Czechia etc feel so much safer, civilised and have much better infrastructure.

I know every country has both good and bad. I’m sure there are some truly fantastic places in the US and I don’t mean to takeaway from that. However, having visited a few of the major cities I am so struck by how uncivilised the place feels a lot of the time. For starters, there are homeless people everywhere. In a city like LA, it’s difficult to find a single street without a crazy homeless person wandering aimlessly. How does the richest country in the world not have the resources to deal with this? Of course, there are homeless people in London and Berlin too but not in the same numbers and certainly not so mentally ill.

I’ve been to over forty countries and I think the US is probably the place I have felt the least safe. So many areas feel incredibly sketchy - especially public transport. Surely it wouldn’t be hard to clean them up, have them well-lit and patrolled to prevent unruly behaviour? Like most countries manage to do?

Violence seems so much more ingrained in the culture of the general public here. I’ve seen so many aggressive shouting matches between strangers in the street, often over such tiny things, in the middle of the day. I’ve found it’s not uncommon for these to become physical. This is something I never see back home except late at night, often between the highly intoxicated.

All in all, I’m excited to get back home. I miss the walkable cities and the high quality food. I miss the culture where tipping isn’t a bizarre requirement and tax is always included in the price. I love having free healthcare and not having to file taxes each year. It will be a joy to not have religious nuts shouting in the street and to not keep crossing the road to avoid the next mental person. 

My home country is far from perfect. There are aspects where the US is definitely superior (much higher wages!) - but I will be forever grateful that I was born where I was.",3789,0.94,3789,0,4047.0,258.0,375,1740967645.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1j27x5r/im_visiting_the_us_for_the_first_time_and_its/,False,True
1kyua0b,offmychest,Just figured out what I've been doing for ten years isn't okay,"I'm literally shaking while writing this so, sorry. Also, throw away, for reasons that will be obvious. 

My brother and I have always been very close. He's my best friend I've ever had. I'm 19m and he's 25, but even with that gap we were inseparable. 

When I was nine he made me give him a hand job. He said it was what normal little brothers did for their big brothers. Hed never lied to me, so I believed him. He drilled into my brain that this was okay, said I wanted to do it, too, and I should want to. I believed him. 

Ever since then he just escalated and escalated until now we've been having sex regularly and somewhere along the line I either lost my spine or lost the ability to comprehend that it's wrong. I've been living like a ghost for a very long time. 

I had an epiphany of sorts tonight. It just hit me, all at once. I hate this man that's my brother. I hate what I've been made to do and I hate who I am today because of it.

1ito5f0,offmychest,Booked my flight tickets today. Last 3.5 weeks in America.,"I am going through a lot of emotions right now. Came here after finishing my undergrad. Got my masters degree here in the US.

Stayed in New Jersey for nearly 7.5 years. Austin, Texas for an year. Seattle for another year.

The happiest point in my life was when I got an internship position at a bank in New York. They arranged for a hotel room in Mid Town New York. Hilton hotel. Up until that point, I was so broke I slept on the floor.

The hotel room. Getting that job offer. Working in New York for 10 months. Going to Met Museum every weekend. There is nothing in my life that comes close to the happiness I experienced in that 6 month period. I came back to college after my summer internship with a return offer in hand. I got a second software engineer job at one of my dream companies.

In the fall of that year, I went on a road trip with 3 friends from New Jersey to New Hampshire. The greenery. The beautiful skies in New Hampshire was soo amazing. The whole trip is etched in my memory.

February to October of 2016 was the happiest period of my life. When I remember America, that will be the period that I will flash in my mind.

I am not voluntarily leaving. Amazon did what Amazon does with people.

I booked my flight tickets today. Broke my lease. Came back to my apartment and cried so much.

1hgx8xg,offmychest,I think I just torched my marriage by withdrawing consent to implant our very last embryo. ,"“Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you, you’re a fuckhead, I fucking hate you.”

These are the words that came out of my wife’s mouth today as we were walking our son home from daycare. We’re both professionals in our 40s… yet in that moment you wouldn’t have guessed. We were having an argument over my perception that she was pandering to our son’s tantrums and not enforcing boundaries, and then… that happened. It was on the street, in public, and I was holding my son’s hand. I asked her quietly several times to not speak to me that way, especially in front of our son, and she just kept repeating herself. I’m in my car now, numb, typing this out.

She’s definitely had a rough go of it lately. She’s just learned that her umpteenth (I’ve lost count) round of IVF has failed, and is also dealing with all the excess hormones she’s been injecting herself with. She’s gotten passed up for a promotion at work, and didn’t get another job at a different company (she has one of the top jobs in the country in her field, but she’s a high achiever). After the birth of our son, she went through horrible PPD and lost her fitness after having qualified for and competing in the world championships for her sport.

I’m not denying she has many valid reasons to feel upset. Fuck knows I’m not perfect and probably contribute to her unhappiness at times. But her reactions to her feelings are getting more and more unhinged. She’s thrown our boy (as a baby) down on the couch in frustration. She’s lashed out and told me she finds me unattractive after I lost fitness during the pandemic after the birth of our son (I still hit the gym 2-3x/week, ran weekly 5ks, cycled up to 100km at a time, and fit into medium t-shirts, though I no longer had visible abs). She’s road raged some other woman—even following her to her exit—after some merge dispute. And now this… this pure, unadulterated vitriol.

It breaks my heart that my son got to see it. His little sponge of a brain has absorbed something today, something I’m hoping to dear God doesn’t become some dormant memory that manifests itself in a couple of decades when it’s his turn to have a serious partner.

I’ve just withdrawn my consent for the transfer of our last remaining embryo. We’ve spent damn near $100k trying, but I can’t bring another kid into this. She will lash out again, she’ll try apologizing, she might love-bomb me… but I’d never forgive myself if something happened to this kid. She’s proven herself to be both physically and verbally abusive. 

But the last thing she’ll do, after all else fails… is resent me, then leave me. 

EDIT:
I’m blown away by the responses and messages, both supportive and critical. I’m sorry I can’t go through and respond to every single one but I do read them. Thank you in particular to the women who have gone through PPD/IVF/both who have reached out, and to those who grew up in abusive households. Your comments and stories are eye opening. 

She’s agreed to couples and individual therapy. Therapists are mandatory reporters here, so I will be following their advice regarding next steps. I appreciate the comments telling me to get out… if a trained professional has safety concerns and comes to the same conclusion, I will. But I also know my wife of the last 3 years is not the same person I fell in love with over a decade ago, and I owe it to our family to see if that person still exists.

He's always been embarrassed with me when I walk with him with my umbrella and often grabs the umbrella and closes it. One day he asked me why I hate being tan (with me coming from an Asian background with the beauty standard being pale and all), I told him it wasn't because of that and that I just didn't want to get a sun burn. He didn't believe me and explained it was colourism, along with the history of discrimination on black people (he's african) and that I should be more honest with him. He'd smile and take away my umbrella when going out and tell me to enjoy the sun multiple times even when I told him it was hurting my skin and I could feel the burn and that sunglasses weren't enough.

Now I have skin cancer and he's telling me I should've pushed more in order for him to believe me while crying. 😀

1k5nyam,offmychest,Acquaintance kept baby alive with 4% brain activity,"I went to high school with a girl who I’ll call S. I was friends with her eventual boyfriend and father of the baby. Right after graduation she finds out she’s pregnant but she carries a gene that could cause some very rare birth abnormality with chromosomal issues. I don’t know the exact name of the condition. She had testing done in utero that showed the baby did indeed have this condition and that he would have somewhere around 4% brain activity IF he survived birth. He would be in a bed hooked up to tubes needing 24/7 care if he lived. She was pressured to abort but she “trusted God” and went through with the pregnancy. This is all information she posted publicly on Facebook. 

The baby boy is born, immediately needs resuscitation, a trach, multiple procedures. This poor baby began his life hooked up to tubes. She starts a Facebook group to document his daily struggles and this poor child lays in a bed 24/7, mouth agape and staring at the ceiling. She had to leave college and quit work to care for him. She’s only 23. 

She’s posted about how they’ve been “pressured” by doctors to consider taking him off life support but she refuses, making posts saying god will heal him. Followed by a post that says they are having a hard time managing his pain. 

I just find it sad I guess. I’ve talked with other girls from high school about it and they all think he is a miracle. That God saved him. How? How can it be fair for this poor baby to suffer everyday and you call that a miracle? Is it really a miracle that he lays there getting bed sores, drooling, and in constant pain? 

I just think it’s sad. I needed to vent because I really feel for this kid and others who suffer from such a terrible condition.

1nfcxjc,offmychest,I think my 5 year old daughter might be a psychopath,"So I once bought a gag gift that’s a little wooden box and when you pull it open, a fake spider pops out to give you a little jump scare. 

Well I used it on my daughter to little to no reaction, other than a little “oh” and that was that. The only thing is that she’s a little obsessed with it now. She’ll often give it to me and be like “open it!” And I will and fake being scared. She’ll laugh like crazy and run away. That’s all fine, I mean giving you little jump scares is normal right?

Well, today I’m with my daughter outside to work on my lawn and she runs up to me shaking the box. She’s like, “open it daddy!” And I’m like “not right now honey” and she gives me her puppy eyes and says please, so I can’t resist. 

She shakes it a little and gives it to me, and when I open it a real spider runs out of it and crawls on my hand. I scream, throw the box, and fling the spider off my hand. I look up and she’s literally crying laughing. 

Apparently she decided it would be a good idea to cut out the fake spider from the box, get a wolf spider from where they usually are behind our shed, and put it in the box to trick me into thinking it’ll be a fake spider, but surprise! It’s a real spider!

While I’m really impressed with her ingenuity to play a practical joke, I’m honestly scared that she was capable of doing that. When I told my wife what happened, she was also crying laughing, so I get where my daughter’s humor came from. No chance that anyone that isn’t a legit psycho is capable of doing something like that.

1nahseh,offmychest,"[NAW] I paralyzed a girl in a car accident 23 years ago, she later killed herself. Ive ""moved on"", but I still cannot forgive myself","In 2002 I was driving with some friends late at night and hit a woman who had drunkenly started walking into the street while walking on the sidewalk with her friends. 

The lead up and immediate aftermath of the accident is nearly a total blur for me. i dont remember seeing her, the exact moment of impact, or even getting out of my car. but i remember coming upon her lying in the street, lying facedown and SCREAMING. her friends had swarmed around her, my friends had flooded out of my car and surrounded me, but everyone was dead silent except for her screaming 

i walked to an angle where she could see me from where she was on the ground and one of her friends must have said something like ""he was driving"" and the girls wailing turned into a flurry of words directed at me. ""YOU PARALYZED ME! YOU FUCKING PARALYZED ME!"" ""MY LIFE IS RUINED"" ""I CANT MOVE ANYTHING"" in her frantic and panicked voice, muffled into the concrete 

EMT arrived and brought her away in an ambulance, police arrived and arrested me thinking that i had been drunk driving. i was ultimately released and cleared of any legal wrongdoing 

to make things worse, i was harassed by the girls family and friends for over a year because they believed the police were wrong about me not being intoxicated

i got in therapy and started working on forgiving myself for the accident and moving on with my life, and was somewhat successful for a few years. i tried to get in contact with the girl via her family to apologize and check on her condition, and i was informed that she had taken her own life just shy of 2 years after the accident. 

at that moment, all of the work i had done on myself completely unraveled and i was right back to standing on that sidewalk, watching her and listening to her scream that i had ruined her life. except now with the knowledge that i had, essentially, actually TAKEN her life 

From that moment on, ive brought that pain and guilt with me everywhere. i live a normal life. Got married, had kids, work and walk the dogs. But in all my quiet moments I hear her words and they eat at me 

my family knows about everything that happened, my wife knows and my few remaining friends from those days. But I dont talk about it, because I feel too much guilt surrounding it. Just typing this out is probably the most Ive spoken on this accident in 20 years. i cant help but think that anyone who knows my ""secret"" thinks of me as a murderer.",3584,0.98,3584,0,3659.0,75.0,173,1757212293.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nahseh/naw_i_paralyzed_a_girl_in_a_car_accident_23_years/,False,True
1hqiypn,offmychest,Our dog sitter died while we were on vacation ,"Today has been super upsetting because the situation was a lot worse than we expected. My partner and I got a phone call from the Animal Services dept of a small town near to our hometown on Christmas Eve (while we were on the beach in Mexico). The employee stated that she had our dog in her custody because our dog sitter had died, but that he was safe and being well cared for, and that she was happy to keep caring for him until our return today. She sent us pictures of him on a walk and posing in a Christmas hat, and she said she spent the night there with him so we felt at least okay with that. And I was happy that it was a super small town where there weren’t other dogs in the shelter. Not that we had other options for anyone else to go pick him up anyway. 

I didn’t get to take that phone call so the first questions I asked which were “how did he get there?? Did he go through anything traumatic? How long ago did it happen; was it today?” Etc., never got answered until picking him up just now. And the answers were hard to hear; I’m so heartbroken for the chaos my pup has been through the last 2 weeks. 

So we paid the highest price possible for the best care possible that we could find in our area. It was a board and train program where he would stay in the trainer’s home and get to enjoy lots of land, receive positive reinforcement training lessons, and we were to be able to get “a lifetime of support” from the trainer. It was through a 5-star rated company. We’ve already done training with him, but he could always use a refresher and we figured a trainer could provide the best care. $2,700 for 2 weeks. It was our first time leaving him with anyone other than my mom. 

She committed suicide and neglected him for at least 2 days prior, and the rest of the time when he stayed at animal services he didn’t even have a blanket. He always needs a blanket 😭 he has an old-looking decent sized bite mark on his head, and probably should have been on antibiotics a long time ago, plus random skin swelling, patches of missing fur, sore hocks and irritation around his paws and legs. None of the above mentioned by animal services lady who was “taking such good care of him”. Taking him to the vet immediately obviously. Just needed to get this off my chest. I’m so happy to have him back and safe but like.. what in the world ",3533,0.88,3533,0,4091.0,558.0,115,1735664526.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hqiypn/our_dog_sitter_died_while_we_were_on_vacation/,False,True
1mmy85v,offmychest,"I wish I never saw what I saw on my boyfriend’s phone, but I’m glad I did","I (22F, Black) am in an interracial relationship with my boyfriend (23M, white). We have been together for about 2 years. A couple nights ago we had the weirdest argument. He wanted to hang out with friends, his car is in the shop, so I drove him to the gas station, bought him some beers for the party, got myself wine to relax and play RDR2(i’ve been obsessed), and dropped him off. I was invited but I do not like his friends.

Later he ubers home drunk, throws up, and I start playfully teasing him about it. Then he tries to exit my game. I thought he was joking so I “fought” back and saved, but then he completely shut off the PC. It was so random and out of character that we just went to bed.

I asked him why and he started saying things like “I’m sorry I’m not like Arthur Morgan” and bringing up insecurities about his looks. I said “you’re being dumb and I love you regardless” because I didn’t know what else to say, i was so confused as to where this was coming from. He didn’t like that and was still being pissy, saying that i was calling him dumb, so I went to sleep on the couch.

When I came back later, he was passed out. I had a gut feeling and searched my name in his messages. I found texts from six months ago, when we briefly broke up, where his best friend told him “I don’t think she’s the one for you” and “I don’t like the things she’s pressuring you to do.” I have no clue what that means. I feel our relationship is even. I like going out to bars and restaurants with or without him. If he comes along, sometimes I pay and sometimes he does. I also do most of the cooking and cleaning and even prep his meals for the week while working and keeping the house clean. y’know the “woman” work 🙄. 

I also saw him saying it was “disgusting” that I was “becoming obese” after birth control. I am not obese, I just went from severely underweight to midsize (size 0 to size 6). Then I checked his group chats. His friends are all white and already make me uncomfortable by saying the n-word and making insensitive comments in my vicinity the first time i met them. Never wanted to be around them since. In the chat they were sharing appalling memes like George Floyd jokes, Jewish jokes, and using the n-word casually. My boyfriend even sent a meme of a Pokémon card saying “catching a negress.” His best friend, the one who said those things about me in the texts and who I felt more comfortable around because he has biracial siblings, was in there too sharing offensive memes.

I wish I never would have seen it because now I cannot unsee it. But I am also glad I did. How could I ever marry him or bring a biracial child into this world knowing their father is like this behind the scenes? I am sure if I brought it up, he would apologize and try to “fix” it. But I do not know if I could ever look past it. I am gutted.

We live together with his family who lets us stay for free. We have two cats together. It will take me a couple months to save and move out. He can tell something is wrong, but I am completely turned off by him now and I do not know when or how to tell him what I saw. 

!UPDATE! Today’s confrontation:

So after spending a couple of days away and being with friends, I finally opened up about the situation despite feeling embarrassed. I think it really comes down to a complete difference in morals. I view my partner as an extension of me. I view my friends the same way. If anyone in my circle spoke like his friends do, I’d be disgusted and cut them off immediately, whether it was in private or in front of me. My boyfriend says he never heard his friends talk like that near me. I don’t remember if he was there when it happened, but I know I called them out in the moment; kind of joking to lighten it, but still uncomfortable and grossed out. I didn’t want to flip out and look like the angry black girl, especially since they’re already racist. One of them did apologize after i said something, but that doesn’t change the fact that they’re all complicit. He knew exactly what his friends were like and still chose to bring me around them.

Do I think my boyfriend is racist? No. Do I think he’s spineless with no moral code? Absolutely. I don’t remember exactly what the meme he sent was because I was a bottle of wine deep and already upset after our fight and seeing him and his best friend talking shit about my weight. I had to scroll a bit in their group chat to even find something he sent, and I’m not sure how old it was. it could’ve been a year ago or just a few months. Still, the fact that he’s in that group at all means he’s again- complicit. Almost every day someone’s saying the n-word. 

When we talked, I also brought up that if we were ever to get married and have all our friends and family together, I would never allow his friends anywhere near the people I love, especially if there were kids in the mix. He agreed and said he’d never consider having them at our wedding or around future children. But that just makes me wonder—if you agree they’re that bad, why would you ever bring me around them in the first place? I truly haven’t accepted any invites to be around the friends who did/said the really vile stuff since the first time I met them about two years ago. There are some I don’t mind as much (except for the BFF who joined in on the weight comments and ironically has biracial siblings), but at the end of the day, they’re all still complicit.

After talking to my friends, a lot of them were disgusted too and encouraged me to break up with him. They even reminded me that I’d have places to stay if I needed it. I thought about it on the drive home and just broke down. The thought of ending things, moving, and untangling my life from his feels overwhelming. I’m not in the best financial situation, and it would take months to get my ducks in a row. I was already feeling pressure to confront him because I couldn’t keep pretending everything was fine to his face.

I came home planning to break it off, I started the convo already breaking down couldn’t bring myself to say explicitly that i wanted to break up. I did start by calling him out and admitting to snooping, and I told him how appalled and disappointed I was. He doesn’t think it’s his fault that his friends say these things and hopes I wouldn’t assume he agrees with them just because they’re “dumb.” He admitted he doesn’t really see them as friends, just “drinking buddies,” which doesn’t make it any better. They only hang out a few times a year (besides the bff and some guys i don’t mind), but they’ve known each other since childhood, and he says he’s scared of being friendless. He also said they make fun of him too, and he’s bad at defending himself, but still—why would you keep people like that in your life??

He told me one of them made him uncomfortable that same night I saw the messages. Apparently, everyone was drinking and one friend sexually harassed him and asking my bf to sleep with him, and some other guys made “jungle fever” comments about him dating me. He says he spent a lot of the night alone in the pool to avoid them. I told him I understand being non-confrontational to a point, but I would hope that even if he doesn’t respect himself enough to stand up to them, he would at least respect me enough to do it for me.

I’ve stuck up for him before—once when his friend was talking shit about him in the same group chat, he showed me, and I grabbed his phone and went off on the guy right then and there. But here I am, feeling like he wouldn’t do the same for me. I told him flat-out, “You told me you think me gaining weight is unattractive, and I’ve been working on it (I’ve lost 15lbs since he said that 6 months ago) and on the flip side, I don’t think it’s attractive to have no respect for yourself or for me, and to be complicit in this friendship while dating a Black woman.” He said that he would confront/talk to them, but regardless, why did it take all of this for him to make that decision??

Right now, I feel disgusted and embarrassed that this is the person I chose. I’m terrified about my living situation and feel like I’ve backed myself into a corner. Yes, I could crash with friends, but that would delay me getting my own place. Living rent-free here has been helping me pay off credit cards and repair my credit (which is already bad thanks to 18-year-old me). My car is also barely hanging on, and I’ve been trying to fix it before moving. Breaking up sounds simple on paper, but for me it’s complicated. For now, I’m keeping things cordial just to have a roof over my head while I figure out my next steps. Trust me, I’m just as disgusted and disappointed as anyone else reading this.

TL;DR: Took time away, talked to friends, and realized my boyfriend’s lack of backbone with his racist friends is a dealbreaker. He says he wouldn’t have them at our wedding or around future kids, but still brought me around them in the past and stays in their group chat. He’s going to confront them. I haven’t broken up yet because I’m stuck living with him while I sort out my finances, but I’m still disgusted ",3504,0.98,3504,0,3577.0,73.0,245,1754870638.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mmy85v/i_wish_i_never_saw_what_i_saw_on_my_boyfriends/,False,True

1hc130s,offmychest,Idgaf that the United Healthcare CEO was killed ,"I work in healthcare as a medical device sales rep and I see first hand how these insurance companies screw over innocent people every day. There was one situation that sticks out to me that involves United Healthcare where I was just shocked by how uncaring they were to a patient that needed a medical device to be safely discharged from the hospital. 

One of the most expensive devices I sell are called Non-Invasive Ventilators. They’re usually meant for people with advanced stage COPD, but are also used for people with certain neurological disorders, thoracic cage disorders, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The device works by acting as a “breathing machine” and prevents the user from retaining too much carbon dioxide, which can be deadly. 

So one day I’m working and I get a call from my boss. He tells me that I have an NIV for a hospital discharge. I look through the testing to make sure he qualifies, and I see that his carbon dioxide retention is through the roof. His testing meets all insurance companies’ standards for an NIV. So I submit for authorization with his insurance company, United Healthcare, and wait. The next morning, I hear back that it has been denied. So, I submit it again, and it gets denied again. Meanwhile, this man is still in the hospital, has been there for a few days already, and just wants to go home - but his doctor won’t discharge him without the NIV. 

At this point I get on the phone with someone at my company who works with the insurance company and ask why the authorization keeps getting denied. She explained that United Healthcare doesn’t approve NIVs for patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (even though basically every other insurer does) and she gave me a list of qualifying diagnoses. 

I bring this list with me to the hospital where I meet with the doctor in the patient’s room. I assure the patient we are doing everything we can to get him out as soon as possible. The doctor asked me what was taking so long, and I explained that even though his testing qualifies, his diagnosis doesn’t, and I show him the list of qualifying diagnosis. “He doesn’t have any of these. I’m not going to lie,” the doctor tells me. I assure him that I’m not asking him to lie, I’m just giving him information. He looks at the list and looks at his patient and he says “this list can go to hell! And that insurance company can go to hell! My patient needs an NIV!” The patient was overhearing all of this and said he would just pay for the device out of pocket (around $10k) since he wanted to go home so badly. He was fortunate that he was well-off and could afford the device without help from his insurance company, but I was just shocked that they would deny the authorization for a life-saving medical device when a patient’s testing clearly shows they need it, just because the patient was obese. 

This incident happened right when I started my job. Now that I’ve been in the field for a few years, nothing surprises me anymore, but that situation remains in my mind. What if the patient hadn’t been well-off and couldn’t afford the out-of-pocket cost? According to his insurance company, he would just be left to die. So idgaf that the CEO was murdered. Clearly he gave no fucks about the lives that were lost because of his stupid policies, and this is just one example out of many that I’m sure exist.

I am a college student, I spent my entite life trying to be good enough for my dad to approve of me, getting good grades, not sleeping around, getting into college.

1oq7bm6,offmychest,my brother committed suicide and i am elated,"for the first eight years of my life i was physically and sexually abused by my older brother. he was eight years older than me. he would regularly break my toys, mentally torment me, beat me and make me beg to stop, spit in my mouth, force me to watch gore and rape content, rape my face and ejaculate in my mouth, and piss all over me, all while laughing maniacally. he left my skull permanently disfigured from physical abuse as an infant when my skull was still soft

no one knew the extent of this. my parents and sister knew he would break my stuff and beat me, but they didn't know the extent of the physical abuse, nor anything about the sexual abuse. he would tell me that he would rape and torture me to death if i told anyone the details. it was a credible threat, and became more so as life went on

he dropped out of high school and went to some kind of camp for troubled teens after he got expelled from school for severely beating a classmate. from there, he joined the military and had a long career there, followed by fedboi mercenary scumbag life. my family revered him as a shining example of turning life around

while him leaving for the military was somewhat of an escape from his wrath, it only reinforced the credence of his threats. he literally dedicated his life to being a professional killer. i told two people through my life that i was abused as a child, but gave no further detail of how or when or by whom. i couldn't, because i was paralyzed by fear

he would always tell me his retirement plan was a bullet. well, a few days ago, he shot himself

my first reaction was extreme joy. not only is my abuser dead, but i am now free to finally work through the pain i have been holding inside me for three decades. i'm not a psychopath, and i do feel empathy and sadness for everybody in my family who misses him because they didn't know him like i did

however, lately i have been experiencing sustained anger. because not only did he beat me to [redacted]ing him, but he also fucking got away with everything with no consequences. my only solace is the hope that memories of what he subjected me to tormented him until the end

overall though, i am mostly relieved and happy that i can talk through these issues without crippling fear. i have a lot wrong with me stemming from the abuse and have needed to address it for so long. now i finally can

the main thing fucking me up right now is that everybody in my family is coming to me feeling sorry and expecting me to be sad. still, no one knows. this post is the first time i have laid out the details. i don't know how to confront them at his service, or if i'll even go. whatever

1ljlh9j,offmychest,My friend was deported and then murdered.,"Edit: I did not expect this to get as much attention as it did. Thank you all for your kind words. I know I am just an internet stranger, but it brings me peace knowing there are good people out there. 

I appreciate your advice to go to media outlets. While I would love to do that, I am leaving that decision up to their family as I feel it’s not my place. 

I saw some people say that crossing a border is illegal. Actually, it is not. That’s the only way to seek asylum. No one chooses where to be born, and it is such a privilege to be born in the U.S. For an administration that touts pro-life propaganda, I have seen no evidence of such. 

I am honestly emotionally burnt out and do not have the energy to argue back and forth about who deserves to be in this country. In my mind, no person is illegal on stolen land. And if you can’t have empathy for people who are just trying to survive and protect themselves and their families, then you’re too far gone in my eyes. I hope you never experience pain like this. 

And to the rest of you, thank you. While I know I will never be the same, I am grateful to know that empathy still persists. Please keep sharing your kindness.

—

I don’t even have words anymore to describe what I’m feeling. 

My friend was granted asylum. A few months back, they had a minor traffic violation. They were deemed a “criminal”, detained, and threatened with deportation. Sending them back to their country was a surefire way to get them murdered. And that’s exactly what happened. 

I do not know how tf to explain to brain dead imbeciles that to seek asylum is legal. To cross the border is legal. To seek safety is legal. That you should have empathy for people who don’t speak or look like you. I’m tired of living in a world like this. 

Everyday, this administration has killed every reason I have to live. I cannot believe we are living like this. Fuck those who voted for this demon.

I had no idea he was in there and immediately my face got red and I was so embarrassed and I saw his junk and he said sorry afterwards. I told my husband when we got home and i had a good laugh about it. 


Later, My husband asked me squarely if his brother’s dick was bigger than his. I laughed it off and said no of course not babe. but it was , by a lot…….. and I just had to tell someone the secret too lmao

1ixfzxc,offmychest,RIP To My Favorite Vibrator,"Well, it finally happened, Ol’ Reliable kicked the bucket. 
We first met back in ‘16 when I was a young college lassie. I snuck off to the mall All By Myself and sheepishly wandered into the back aisle of the local Spencer’s. There she was, my floral printed beauty. She matched my shirt, so naturally, she had to be mine.
I paid in cash, lest my nosy mother check my bank account and see what her sweet baby girl was getting up to (she would later find this favorite toy of mine under my mattress but that’s neither here nor there). The cashier asked if I needed any cleaner or batteries. Fuck, did I? I said, “haha nope already got that.” Real cool, real smooth.

Over the years she came with me (and I came with her) through college and my first house and my inevitable move back to my parents. She was a trooper. And though I tried several times to replace her with newer, fancier, rechargeable options, I always came back to her. She even unclogged my ear once when I had mono. 

And last night, she died in my hands. Something in her snapped, and instead of her usually steady thrum, she produced nothing but a sad rattle. I did what I could to revive her, but after nearly a decade of service, she was too far gone.

So here’s to the death of my favorite vibrator. They just don’t make ‘em like her anymore. (They probably do, I’ll have to go back to Spencer’s) ",3315,0.98,3315,0,3384.0,69.0,129,1740438599.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ixfzxc/rip_to_my_favorite_vibrator/,False,True

1hvzw2t,offmychest,I will probably never buy Christmas gifts for a family in need ever again.,"In 2023, a mom on my local moms group posted a plea for toys for her daughter's Christmas. She said she and her husband couldn't afford to buy anything, and I felt bad, because many people were commenting with rude and degrading responses. I didn't know this girl, but it turned out that we had mutual acquaintances and we also happened to work in the same hospital. People said she a genuinely kind person and a hard worker. I bought some toys and clothes for her and she cried when she picked it up, thanking me for helping her out.

This past Christmas, I heard she had to quit work to care for her mother, and she welcomed a second baby. She made a post again on the moms group and asked for small things for her kids. I offered to do it again and I bought things for both daughters. The mom told me that these were the only presents her kids would receive this Christmas as she and her husband were struggling. They even had to sell one of their cars, she claimed. 

Yesterday, she sent me a message to thank me for the gifts. I don't know what prompted me to click on her profile, but there was a recently posted video she she shared from her TikTok. Turns out this mom is trying to become an influencer. She boasts having an elaborate gaming desktop; she spends money on designer bags; she goes on shopping sprees for products to endorse and boost her followers on social media; and she shares shopping hauls on expensive products for herself and her husband. 

I feel so stupid. I know you can't always believe what people say, especially when they claim to be in a rough situation, but damn, some people just play you and take advantage of anyone's kindness. I know not all people do this, but it's kind of ruined any sort of desire I have left to help families especially during the holidays. And I also feel bad thinking this way.

1hk7wlg,offmychest,My deepest secret turns twenty-two; Is no longer my secret,"We met twenty-two years ago today. It was a serendipitous encounter. I should have never met you, but the universe had other plans.

I was covering for a colleague and signed your loan docs with you. From the moment our eyes met, I knew you would change my life. Our story is a long one, intertwined, complicated, ugly, messy, and beautiful.

I could never have known that you would give me my greatest joy and my happiest day on earth: my baby boy, Beau.

I could never have predicted that you would leave me too soon, unannounced. No one called. No one knew about us. Two months after your suicide, I found your obituary online.

I was looking for your cell phone number. I was looking forward to introducing you to your son, as we always said we would when he was older.

Through a series of events that are too long to write today, Beau decided it was time to meet your folks. Eleven days ago, I wrote the letter, enclosed a few photos, and sent it off with a prayer.

Six days ago, we got a phone call. Your mother did not know what to say. By the end of the call, we were set to meet the next day. One restless sleep and then we met your parents, his grandparents.

There was laughter, there were lots of stories. Mine were mostly confessions. Professions of my love and remorse.

Eight thousand thirty-six days. 48% of my lifetime has been spent bouncing between obsessing over you and trying to forget you. The latter is impossible. He looks so much like you.

The one thing your father said over and over and over when he met our son:

I promised them I would go ski with them at least once this year. Today was that day.

And I was... pathetic. I stayed on the school slope. My legs were hurting just taking the T-Bar ski lift, having to take break at the top and while going down. I was sweating.

And... my husband was wonderful. I told him to not wait for me, he told me he was not in a hurry. When I told him I had to stop after going down once, he walked with me to the cottage and carried my skis. We went our separate ways for  the rest of the morning, as I didn't expect to be able to do much more. He didn't mind.

I did a couple more slopes, always pathetic, and at the end of the day, I did barely anything compared to him, but i was DEMOLISHED. And he carried my skis, told me how proud of me he is, and how happy he is that I made the effort. He is cooking me dinner because I cannot stand up.

I love him so much. If people wonder why I don't care valentine's day so much, it's because every day with him feels like valentine's day.

Ever since then I've been drinking TONS of water and hot green tea instead.

Yesterday was a really bad day for me and I was just beyond everything that happened. I sat down to relax with my WoW guild and run some content when I thought ""You know... I'll just have one soda."" I grabbed one, cracked it open, took a drink, and it was easily the most disgusting fucking thing I've had in a while.

When I first swore off soda I couldn't imagine not being able to hold it down and I'd break and go back to sucking down Diet Mt. Dew, but two months off it and I just can't. It's gross. I didn't even finish the full can, I just took a couple sips and dumped it down the sink. It feels wasteful, but I don't think I can go back to drinking soda anymore.

1kr3czv,offmychest,My husband will never forgive me,"Anonymous because I’m so deeply ashamed of myself.

Yesterday I managed to destroy my entire life and marriage in a matter of seconds.

My husband was putting our son (6) to bed and when he was getting his pjs on my husband said to me “we need to remember to put the garbage outside tonight”

And I absolutely lost it. I have been trying to navigate mental load and everything. And in tired of him constantly saying “we need to…” and then it turns out it’s me who has to do the thing. We both work full time, I as well have a second job to bring in more income. 

I lost it and said why can’t you just do it instead of “reminding me” and I said “we is really you saying you” and he said “no it isn’t” and I lost my mind, I screamed at him that I was leaving and never coming back and stormed out of the house.

Our son heard it and was apparently inconsolable. My husband called me and told me how horrible I was, that I have no right to do that shit to our child and I have to come back and make it right. I did come back and apologize to our son but the damage has been done and I have been told in no uncertain terms I’ve caused him lifelong trauma.

My husband originally said he would never forgive me, he has since come around and said he might forgive me in time so long as I never yell in front of our son again.

I am just so heartbroken that I let one moment of weakness completely destroy the trust and love my husband had for me. I am so sad. I’ve been crying the entire night when I’ve got no right to.

I kept having weird dreams telling me to wake up, and when I finally did, my youngest sister had texted us that they were in the icu. I fed my cats and brushed my teeth and then I got the call. Huge blood clot in her lung at 61.
Needless to say we’re all in shock. They live states away and my dad isn’t doing well with this at all. Duh but yknow what I mean.
I’ve gone through my fair share of tragedy and trauma but this…no words. I don’t know what to do with myself.
Anyway, if you still have her in your life, tell her you love her.


Edit: Thank you for the overwhelming response. The initial processing led me to post but stay anonymous. I suppose there was a better subreddit but this was the first I found.

I appreciate the kind words. However, “you’ll be fine” doesn’t land as nicely as I think y’all think it does. I can’t and will never be “fine” again. And I know this because of stuff I’ve lived through before today. You should never aspire to just be fine.

I mentioned this in a reply, but I had no idea what I was doing when I made this post. I’m calm and it still feels like a weird dream until I read y’all’s comments. Reading that you all have experienced something similar and providing loving advice, it really grounds me. I can remind myself this is real, and I’m not wrong to feel the way I feel. Yes this is the suckiest club I’ve ever joined, but I’m not alone.

Heartbreak is a real thing.,"I'm posting this anonymously because I have never been so humiliated in my life. I'm honestly devastated. I can't believe this is happening to me. My husband hasn't had sex with me since our son was born. Our son is 8 months old. I've tried initiating but my husband always has an excuse. It hurt. I thought he wasn't attracted to me any more but that's only half the story. I found condoms in our truck. When I confronted my husband he admitted to having sex with other women but there's no feelings. He says he's not attracted to me but it's not because of how I look. He flat out told me he doesn't want to have sex with me because I'm a mother. He thinks sexual activity of any kind is too degrading for me now. He told me he loves me more than ever but woman shouldn't have sex once they become mothers. I don't know if he's lying or what. We've been married for 8 years and he casually admitted to seeing other woman like it was nothing. When I told him I was going to stay with my sister he was surprised. I can barely sleep.

I told him absolutely not. I wouldn’t lie to her, especially not now. He blew up, said I was “choosing sides” and “trying to ruin his marriage.” I told him I wasn’t the one sneaking around behind a pregnant woman’s back.

1jud2g8,offmychest,"My brother left his girlfriend for a pocket pussy, he's cooked.","So my younger brother (21) had a beautiful gf (21) of 3 years, they were together through all of uni and were seriously in love, they planned a whole future together, family, marriage, kids etc, she was a super sweet, caring loyal girl, a rare gem today which I constantly reminded him of.

So we regularly call on the phone and after all that time they were still deeply in love, he then goes to mexico for a retreat. While in mexico he meets a young girl and discusses to me about getting with her, I said of course don’t. And he did, he only kissed her drunk and then 2 days later called me and said he fingered a 55 year old and prematurely came in his hand on the beach and ran away leaving her there.

I’m of course blown away, he then for the next 6 weeks is constantly telling me how he wants to break up with his gf, how he doesn’t love her anymore, how he can do better, travel etc, he started seriously neglecting her, not responding, not caring about her, pulling away, he even stopped having sex with her and would sneak off in the middle of the night to watch porn by himself and sneak back in bed.

I kept telling him to get his shit together because he is throwing away his entire future with a beautiful girl and future mother of his children. He of course didn’t listen and just neglected her further while insisting that she was so obsessed with him that she would never leave, I told him she would repeatedly and he stuck by this.

He then kept insisting on his “mission” which was to dopaminemax by getting a pocket pussy, a bunch of mushrooms and a Quest 3 VR headset and watch porn all day to dopaminemax.

Of course I tell him for weeks not to do it but he would actually aggressively shut me down if I told him not to and end the call and not speak to me if I bought up how it was a bad idea.

A week or so goes by and his “mission” was ready, he had the new VR and his mushrooms and his new pocket pussy he actually named “Martha”. I still told him not to but he did anyway.

So next he takes the mushrooms and a couple hours in just when he is about to start she calls him, like a idiot he answers and they speak for a hour while she is crying saying something is off, she gets it out of him where he says he doesn’t love her anymore and maybe they should break up, she then spends the whole night desperately crying alone in a fit of tears while my brother has his VR pocket pussy mission and enjoys himself.

The next day he tells me they spoke and they didn’t officially break up and he kept reinforcing that she would never leave him no matter what. I told him he is wrong.

A few days later she officially breaks up with him, he then calls me absolutely crying balling his eyes out in complete disbelief. I of course am absolutely speechless.

He goes crazy desperately calling and texting her, even her mum and sister, begging, it gets so bad to the point she has to block him. He even suggested sending letters to her house and making her powerpoint presentations to explain things.

He for weeks is depressed crying is eyes out, constantly saying he has a feeling she is coming back to him, she would never leave him. It’s been 6 weeks and he is still obsessed just not crying as much.

It’s so hard for me because I am constantly trying to help him get his life together but feels impossible to help when he acts like this.

I am terrified because I have never been to therapy and don’t really know what to expect, but I am going to do it. Also, I live in a very rural area and my husband’s family does not have a lot of money, we couldn’t afford to have a biohazard company come out and the closest company would’ve been at least an hour out, probably longer. I now know homeowners insurance will often cover crime scene clean up but we did not know that at the time. I can’t change what happened or how we handled it now. 

A week ago today, my husband’s mother shot and killed herself. My brother in law and his grandpa found her, and my husband saw her from the back (she was sitting in a wheelchair) before the coroner removed her body. I was spared that image in my head but I did come in after they had taken her out and saw her elderly father (husbands/BILs  grandpa) on his hands and knees lapping up her blood into a bucket. My husband was about to start helping too (he did wipe the blood from the table/chair she was sitting next to) and I really couldn’t stand the thought of the two of them having to do that. I made my husband leave, his grandpa is stubborn and wouldn’t go until the biggest part of the mess was up, but he and I pushed her blood into a bucket. I stayed after he couldn’t do it anymore and wiped up what had dried as well as picked up the tissue that was left behind. 

My husband has seen some stuff in his 27 years of life- has been shot at, lived through his father’s suicide 23 years earlier, and witnessed his mom try to hurt herself in his childhood.. but this is the most f’d up thing I have ever witnessed. I am traumatized. I have been in the family for 7 years and loved his mother very much. I have been in go mode but now that the funeral is over the gravity of what I have seen is really starting to catch up to me. I do feel like I can talk to my husband about it but I’d rather not because he lost his mom. He saw her slumped over in her chair. He saw the worst of it. I only saw the aftermath. I just really don’t know how I’m supposed to move past this. 

I am considering therapy but because my husband is refusing therapy of his own I have this idea in my head that if he saw worse than I and can handle it, I need to handle it too.

1lt9nuy,offmychest,Most men are terrible at oral,"I’ve got a body count somewhere between 70-80, and I can tell you with certainty that most men are just awful at oral sex. They all seem to think they’re great at it and love bragging about their stamina, finding the right spots, having all their partners come from it…but really, they have no clue what they’re doing and can’t take direct instruction, let alone suggestion. 

It’s really disappointing almost every time. What I can’t figure out is: why do they think they’re good at it? Do their sexual partners always fake having a good time? Have they never been told that 30 seconds is nothing? I’ve given oral for 15-20 minutes before; why can’t men give back even half that amount of time? I get that it makes the jaw and tongue sore—there are pretty simple exercises you can do to increase your mouth stamina. (And they help keep your neck from looking saggy as you age too, just saying.)

And why can’t they pick up on cues? Like, if the woman you’re going down on tells you to keep doing exactly what you’re doing and right there, why do you keep changing it up? We’re literally telling men what works for us and they ignore it instantly. It’s so frustrating. The max time I’ve gotten from about 80% of partners was about 2 minutes before they decided they were done and I must’ve obviously gotten off. 🤦‍♀️

1m993j8,offmychest,I'm glad I came home early..,"Typically, I leave work at 3.
Today, I left work at 2, and it took me about an hour to get home. I come in the door, set my stuff down and hear my mom talking on the phone to someone- not unusual. She is 66, has pancreatic cancer and lots of doctors appointments. There aren't many days I come home and she's not on the phone.

Suddenly, I hear mention of routing and account numbers, and it piqued my interest. I see that she has some information written down next to her: Publishers Clearing House. $12 million. 
As soon as they heard my voice ask who she's talking to, they asked her if she was alone, and obvs she said no. They then tell her that she needs to get away from me to continue the transaction. I let her know that their only goal is to drain her bank account.

She told me that they tried to tell her that no one could know about the transfer until it was complete.. I responded with the thought that PCH probably doesn't do direct deposit by phone. She searched* the number and found out it was a robo-call.

1kebi0x,offmychest,Kid killed the cat.,"My wife went on a business trip for several days. During this time our very old cat, who my wife had bought years before we ever met, and who we expected was starting to near her final days, took a dramatic turn for the worse. 

I wanted to keep that thing alive for my wife to get back and was thinking of taking her to the vet the very next day. Perhaps some short term relief could be given to her to get her to eat and drink. I also was thinking the added stress of the vet would just be too much for her. The poor thing did everything in its power to stay close to me and the kids and just sat in our laps that evening. 

I sort of expected that she maybe wouldn't make it, so was trying to have the kids spend as much time as possible with her. That night my kids and I all laid on the bed next to her and I kept her in a little circle of pillows and blankets to protect her from us. 

Around 4am I woke to a stifled small meow and felt around for her to only feel my 4 year olds hair. I felt underneath his head and felt her small squished body. I frantically pushed him off of her and put her into my arms as her breathing slowly faded away and her heart stopped. My son was completely out and had no clue this had happened.

I just put her body in her carrier and waited until morning to let my wife know the cat had passed. She was well aware that she was dying so I didn't really say anything other than I held her in my arms in her last moments. 

The strange thing was at the last 5 or so seconds of her life she calmed down and started purring. I cried a bunch. I just wanted her last moments to be surrounded by her family. But my son squished her to death and I will take that to my grave. 

Edit: Thanks for all the well wishes. I just wanted to say that my post did not do a good enough job at describing that I don't under any circumstances blame my kid. It is just a fact that he may have unknowingly smothered the cat to death.

She had invited me before and even asked them to provide a vegan option for me. That time, they got pizza, and she gave it to me.

After lunch, she messaged me on Teams to ask if I liked it and if I felt full. I thought that was kind of sweet, until she laughed and told me it was real cheese, and she knew it was real the whole time.

What makes this weirder is that we’ve been having lunch together for over a year now, along with a group of colleagues, playing Uno, going out for lunch, just regular coworker stuff. I trusted her, so I didn’t double-check the ingredients like I usually do. And the cheese was tasteless just like most vegan stuff usually is. 

Like… what?? I mean, the world won’t end if I accidentally eat cheese, but this just makes me wonder—was she trying to ‘catch’ me? Get a reaction? Mess with me for fun? I don’t know. I laughed it off in the moment, but yeah, I don’t think I want to share lunch with her again.

1hwcgek,offmychest,I just discovered that my friend hasn't been properly washing his crotch or ass for the last 3 years,"I'd noticed recently that my friend smells quite bad (he has smelled for a while, but recently it's gotten worse). It's not your usual body odor. It's a combination of odors, of which about 80% is rancid cat urine. The smell is not super intense. You can smell it from a few feet away, but it doesn't bowl you over or anything. However, it is revolting. My friend (let's call him Neil) has become nose blind to the odor, so he wasn't even aware that he smelled bad. 

This issue came to light because his father told him ahead of Christmas dinner not to come over unless he took a proper shower and washed his clothes, because he smelled. Neil, whom I don't see that often because we live too far apart, called me to ask if he smelled. (I'd seen him in person a couple weeks before that.) I confirmed that he did in fact smell bad, but I hadn't mentioned it at the time because he'd been going through a mental health crisis recently and I was afraid this would push him over the edge. (The hygiene issue predates the mental health crisis by a long time, so the smelliness was not triggered by it.)

At first I assumed that the reason Neil smelled bad is because the smell of his house had permeated his clothing. He has a serious odor problem in the house because he used to have a cat who urinated on the wall-to-wall carpeting for years and he never properly cleaned it up. I gave him instructions on how to remove odors from clothes by soaking them in a mixture of water and white vinegar. When I asked later if this technique had worked, he said he wasn't sure, because he couldn't smell the odor to start with, so he couldn't tell if it was now gone. But he also mentioned that some of his personal odor may be coming from his bathing habits. I had assumed up till then that he showered regularly like a typical person. Well, I was mistaken.

Neil had a serious accident about 3 years ago and was bed-ridden for months. During this time, it was physically impossible for him to take a shower. He had a nurse that would give him sponge baths once or twice a week, but for the most part he simply went unbathed. During this period, he concluded that regular showering wasn't actually necessary. In his view, he had stopped doing it and it hadn't made a difference. He confessed to me that he rarely showered anymore, maybe once or twice a month. Instead, his daily cleaning ritual is to rub a wet washcloth under his arms. That's it. The washcloth doesn't even have soap on it. As I discussed this with him, it became clear that he hasn't been regularly/properly washing his crotch or ass for years. I was disgusted to hear this. I wanted to shake him and scream ""What the hell is wrong with you!""

And yes, I realize that these issues are connected to his overall mental health. I did some research about this and it mentioned that it's extremely common for people with mental health issues to neglect their personal hygiene. He is already seeing a therapist and a social worker (he's been seeing them for years), and I talk to him on the phone for about an hour every day, much of that time spent trying to talk him down from the ledge over whatever the crisis of the day is. 

I don't expect advice or anything (although I'm not adverse to receiving advice). I'm just venting. Lately, I've been feeling like I'm at my breaking point from dealing with his many issues. During his recent mental health crisis, he was calling me three times a day. I want to be helpful, but I'm so tired.",2956,0.99,2956,0,2986.0,30.0,103,1736314167.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hwcgek/i_just_discovered_that_my_friend_hasnt_been/,False,True
1ofcnwq,offmychest,"I had a daughter when I was 14. She’s an adult now, and she doesn’t know I exist","When I was 14, I got my first girlfriend pregnant. We were kids, completely in love, and completely over our heads. Her parents were ultra-wealthy, controlling, and cared more about appearances than people. Mine were well-off too, but they hated her family. It was a proper Romeo and Juliet mess.

When she got pregnant, her parents gave her an ultimatum to cut me off completely, or they’d throw her out on the street. I was 14. What was I supposed to do? I wanted to fight, but everyone around me made the decisions for us. And that was it… one day I was a kid with a girl I loved and a baby on the way, the next day I was just alone.

My daughter was born, and I never got to meet her. They shut me out completely. No photos, no contact, nothing. I wrote letters for years that I never sent.

Now she’s an adult. She doesn’t know who I am. I see reunion videos on TikTok, dads meeting the daughters, and I cry myself to sleep like some pathetic fool. I imagine what her voice sounds like. I imagine what kind of music she likes, if she has my smile, if she knows someone out there has loved her her whole life without ever getting to say it.

My wife doesn’t know how bad it eats at me. We have a son together, and I love him more than anything. But there’s a part of me that’s stuck in 14-year-old me, still standing there, losing everything. I’ve built a good life, but some nights I just feel like a ghost haunting a life that could have been.

I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I just needed to say it somewhere.

1jldxi6,offmychest,"I thought two of my best friends ghosted me, turns out they passed away.","I used to see two of my best friends (Steve &amp; Nikki) at a bar all the time. They were a happy couple, they'd do anything for me &amp; I'd do anything for them. They were caring, principled &amp; just generally people of very good character. When I was homeless they housed me, when I was hungry they fed me, &amp; when I was sad they showed me a good time. Steve had a 9 year-old kid (previous marriage) and Nikki was an excellent parent. Steve was a cyber-security specialist &amp; Nikki worked in BoH food service usually. Thing is, both of them had problems with drugs. Steve was a recovering heroin addict (sober from heroin for well over a decade) &amp; Nikki was an alcoholic trying to get sober (they had periods of 60ish days of sobriety before relapsing usually). Both of them did wayyy too much blow, usually for days at a time. Neither of them knew how to stop. 

One day Steve &amp; I talked because he was talking to a woman I previously hooked up with (Nikki was fine with it), he wanted to know if it was okay to engage. I said ""yeah we're good"" &amp; we made fun of some politicians we didn't like. That was the last time I talked to him in person &amp; the last time I saw Nikki. A few days later I sent both of them my periodic ""homie checkup"" text when we haven't seen each other in a while. No response. I didn't go back to the bar for a while because I was trying to save money &amp; drink less. Only when I went back there do I find out that Steve did enough blow that his heart nearly exploded &amp; he had a heart attack. Nikki also had heart issues at the same time (possibly a bad batch?) and lasted a bit longer but ultimately passed away. Nikki also had a DNR but I'm not sure if that played a role. Steve was a millennial with a house, a child, 6 figure salary, caring partner and plenty going for him. Nikki was young, lively, plenty of friends &amp; plenty of experience and opportunities to move on with her career or whatever else they wanted to do. Both of them were trying to be good at some point but addiction ultimately took their lives. I'm so glad I sent that ""homie checkup"" text but it sucks that it was too late.

1jn1jid,offmychest,I left my wife after she said I wasn’t manly enough. This is the post and the update I made on relationships that got deleted.,"
We’d been together since we were 18. She was my first everything where as she’d been with a few people before me. We have an 18 year old daughter together who is and amazing brilliant and kind person, I couldn’t have asked for a better kid. 

The last few years my wife has been making the odd comment about my manliness etc and I’ve just brushed it off but she’s really stepped it up the last year and I ended up leaving her about three months ago over it. 

I don’t want this to sound like a humble brag but I do think I’m quite “manly” while also just being a normal person. I’m tall, workout a few times a week, I can do any DIY around the house, I can fix cars, i used to be an amateur boxer and cage fighter and still do it as a hobby to keep fit. The things she said that aren’t manly about me are: 

I like to bake 

I like to cook 

I don’t drink, I don’t care if other people do it’s just not for me 

I like Taylor Swift, Charlie XCX, Arianna Grande, Sabrina Carpenter etc. my main choice in music will always be rap but having a teenager daughter these sort of artists get played and I like some of their songs so I listen to them. I don’t see that as a bad thing 

I have a powerful car and a motorbike but my preferred method of transport is a VW Up. It’s a small car with a little engine but if it’s just me and my gym bag or work bag I don’t see the problem plus I’m not one of them who feels like a car someone drives means anything. My ex wife disagreed and said I give off a certain vibe in it. 

I tend to walk away from arguments with strangers. She perceives any slight as personal insult. If you cut in front of her in traffic she’s leaning on the horn, don’t say thank you if you hold a door open, she’s screaming and shouting at you. I just prefer to let things slide. An example is someone was being obnoxious to me on a night out for no reason. He was in my face calling me all sorts of names and even pushed me a couple of times. I just smiled at him and walked away saying I hope he gets home safely. When we got home she said I embarrassed her in front of her friends by letting him talk to me like that. I said what’s the point of me knocking out a drunk kid who’s half my size. She said I’m a doormat for the world. 

There’s a few other things mainly connected to stuff me and my daughter have in common around stupid social media videos. She said it’s like living with two teenage girls 

In September I left her. I said I can’t be spoken to like this anymore and be belittled. It’s not fair. Even then she had a dig and said a real man would change. She’s changed her tune since and said she’s willing to go to therapy both individual and couples and try and sort out her issues. 

I don’t know if the cuts from things she’s said are too deep though? Since I’ve left I’ve felt more relaxed and happier. I don’t have to worry when I put a song on or want to bake a cake or cook something a bit different what would be said etc. At the same time though it’s scary as she’s all I’ve known and being alone and meeting new people scare the life out of me as I’ve never done that before. 

Everything is telling me I’m on the right path now but I have a niggling doubt in my head that all those words she spoke about me are true and I am an annoying person that will be alone forever. 

TLDR: I left my wife for constantly questioning my manliness and now I’m scared of the future. 

Edit: sorry to everyone I didn’t get a chance to reply to. Thank you all so much for all the love. I’m genuinely humbled. 

Update:

Hi all. I received a lot of love on my first post and had a few people ask for an update so here we are over three months later. 

First and foremost I didn’t get back with her and the divorce is now in motion. Our daughter is very understanding says I seem lot happier and more relaxed. My ex wife kept asking me back until about a month ago she announced she’s seeing a 23 year old and when I felt relief rather than hurt or jealousy I fully realised I am over her. 

Not really much else to report. I’m still baking and cooking and boxing and cage fighting lol. I’ve got tickets to go see Sabrina carpenter with my daughter and we also got tickets to go see Kendrick Lamar so I still like my rap and my teen girl pop lol. 

I also want to say a big thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me after my last post. You were all so sweet and it was both humbling and gave me a massive big head lol. Thank you all ❤️

1okfzl5,offmychest,"I sent a letter to my lost love, I have not seen her in over 30 years. She responded.","After carrying the weight of what was unsaid for decades, I finally wrote a letter to someone I once loved deeply but have never gotten over. The letter was not me trying to reconnect or stir up anything inappropriate, just find peace. I had a dream about her 6-7 weeks ago, the subsequent depression had me in a very dark place, emotionally. I think the letter I sent to her was a last-ditch lifeline for my sanity.

The last time we spoke was in 1992, she's now been married for over 30 years with two adult children. I just needed to say the things I never got to say — to honor what we had, and to let it go with care. I expressed profound grief for a timeline that never had a chance to develop fully.

And to my surprise, she wrote back. I was honestly dumbfounded.

Her reply wasn’t cold, dismissive, or uncomfortable. It was warm and beautifully sincere. She acknowledged the bond we once shared without crossing any lines, did not rewrite the past or make promises she couldn’t keep. She met me in that space of shared memory with kindness and understanding, quietly recognizing what once mattered and allowing it to be laid to rest.

In my letter to her I stated that I wished that I could have undone the choices that separated us, to have faith in what we had. She replied that regrets can be hard to let go of but I need to forgive younger me for I had no idea of how things would have progressed.

I’ll never forget what she and I were and thanks to her response I no longer have to carry it. We parted again but this time with dignity and understanding.

1k2v0e2,offmychest,She clung to my arm while her girlfriend spat at me. I stayed,"Last night I (F26) was selling shirts at a concert. On my way to the car, I passed by a couple fighting. At first I didn’t think much of it until I saw the girl crying and yelling “leave me alone” to her partner. Like, full-on sobbing. I got closer and asked, “Are you okay?”
That’s when I realized it was a lesbian couple, the masc one was yelling at her, being aggressive, and saying horrible shit to her. 

And then the masc turned her anger to me. Started insulting me. Called me homeless. Spit on the ground in my direction.

I told her, “You’re a girl. She’s a girl too. Treat her better.”
And she LOST it.

But I didn’t leave.
The femme girl clung to my arm. She was crying, saying sorry, and I just kept repeating “You’re okay. I got you. It’s okay.”

Then some other girls walked by, saw what was going on, and started going OFF on the masc one. There was a fight like actual punches. I stayed by the crying girl and kept talking to her.
She called her brother. The police came. I stayed until she was safe.

One of the girls who helped told me, “Thank you for standing by her. That was really cool.”
We talked. She asked for my IG. Called me cute like 10 times. Gave me three hugs.
I guess that was nice. But honestly, I can’t stop thinking about the girl who was crying.

I can’t stop thinking about how fucking unfair it is that someone like that (reckless, disrespectful, controlling) has a girl that pretty, that soft, that fragile.
She deserved to be loved. Not humiliated.

And yeah, maybe I was jealous.
Because I would’ve protected her.
I wouldn’t have made her cry like that.

I don’t know.
I didn’t get her number. Didn’t ask for anything.
I just didn’t want to leave her alone.

I hope she left her.

We went to the hospital and got him checked out. He got a cut in his throat when the bottle cap was in there, maybe worse from when I pulled it out. But he is fine now. The doctors said the cuts weren't serious and that he would be ok.

I feel sick, is something wrong with me. Didn't I save his life? All I got were dirty looks at the hospital. 

I look at  don't understand what i am feeling. All I know is that I am lying in bed looking at the cut left on my knuckle, like the only real proof that this happened. It all feels so surreal. I don't know what i want from this post. Maybe just to say something to anyone. 

I just don't know.

Edit: Hey everyone, I wanted to thank you all for helping me understand what I am feeling and helping to explain how the parents might be feeling. 

It has helped me understand more. That and you guys were probably right that a lot of this negative feeling is the result of coming off an adrenaline high.

1jszxfc,offmychest,I got uninvited from a wedding in the worst way and I feel worthless. I’m tired of life.,"I was never told. The bride-to-be went up to my husband at church today and asked him if he was excited for the wedding. He said yes we’re looking forward to it.

She then proceeded to tell him that actually only he was invited in the end. The RSVPs were for both of us, but the actual invite only had his name on the envelope. We didn’t notice. 

Edit: My husband then told her if I’m not invited he isn’t going and left it at that.

I’ve been crying on and off for the last couple of hours because they could’ve just told me. I wouldn’t have been upset. But doing this to me, not even telling me but sneakily uninviting me by not putting my name on the envelope AFTER we both RSVPd is horrible. It’s not about the fact that I’m uninvited. It’s how they did it. It’s the sheer lack of respect.

1k8bjut,offmychest,I Thought Universal Healthcare Wasn't the Answer; Now My Aunt is Dying,"I’ve always had good health insurance and never had to worry about it. It’s amazing how much your perspective can change when you see things differently.

Seven months ago, my 60 year old aunt (that I dearly love) went to the doctor while she still had health insurance from her job. She was unable to continue working, had already left the job, and wanted to be seen before her insurance ran out. She had been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain, and after testing, doctors discovered a small tumor in the lower part of her right lung. They recommended a biopsy and immediate treatment.

But then, her insurance coverage ended, so testing and treatment were delayed. 

She applied for Social Security Disability, but was denied. She tried other options, but nothing worked out. In a last-ditch effort, her daughter transferred custody of her child to my aunt so she could qualify for Medicaid.

Six months later, when she finally had insurance again, she returned to the doctor. They performed a biopsy, CT scan, PET scan, and more. The diagnosis was devastating: stage 4 cancer. The small tumor in her lung had grown, and now it has spread to both lungs and beyond. There’s nothing more they can do, and she doesn’t have much time left. It's inoperable and incurable. 

Now, having seen firsthand how difficult it is for people without insurance, I believe universal healthcare might be the answer. I feel ashamed that it took all of this for me to realize the flaws in the system. It makes me feel like a selfish, entitled person. 

*edit

Almost everyone is attacking me, and this is exactly what's wrong with the system. I admitted I was wrong, apologized, and changed my perspective — yet I'm being met with personal attacks and cruel words. This kind of response is why our country is so divided, and why real issues are so hard to solve. Treating people this way doesn't help anyone. 

**another edit and I'm done

All of you saying you're not the problem are wrong.

The real reason our country is so divided isn’t because people like me ""refuse to understand"" until it affects us personally. It's because of how people treat others, even when they admit they were wrong and are trying to learn. It's because people would rather attack than listen.

I never claimed cruel words were the root of every problem. But they are part of the reason real conversations and real progress break down.

People here have openly said they don't care that my aunt is dying. I have never once said I don't care about anyone else's suffering. I simply didn't know, hadn't fully realized, how brutal the system is for uninsured people. And instead of using that as a chance to educate or build bridges, some of you decided to pile on cruelty.

That's part of why we stay divided. Not because people make mistakes, but because we punish them when they try to understand.

1kuzbdo,offmychest,[29M] My girlfriend thought a pregnancy scare would “change” me. I celebrated when the test was negative. I dumped her two months later.,"
Yeah. I said it.

We were together for 7 years. She knew from day one: I don’t want kids. I don’t want marriage. I don’t want the house, the in-laws, the baby photos, the drama. My goal in life is to travel, live freely, and not end up like everyone else in my family—tied down and miserable.

She agreed. Or at least, she pretended to.

Then, two years ago, she started to shift. Suddenly, she was making comments every day about what we’d need for “our future kid.” Talking to my mom behind my back about buying a house. Saying her parents already saw us married. I thought it was a weird joke between families. I let it slide.

Then came June 22, 2024.

She told me her period was late. She had all the ""symptoms."" I was freaking out. My family started congratulating us. Her family was over the moon. She was glowing, talking about names and parenting like it was already happening.

I begged her to take the test. When she finally did, it came back negative.

I celebrated—like it was f**king New Year's Eve.

She cried. Screamed. Called me cold and said I’d be a terrible father. And maybe I would be. But I never wanted to be one in the first place.

She came back the next day like nothing happened, talking about how cute it would be to have a daughter, and how I should pamper her when she's pregnant ""next time.""

No. Just no.

I ended it two months later.

My family is ashamed of me. Her parents hate me. She's still trying to reach out.

But I feel free. I’d rather be the villain in their story than betray who I am. -- and end up stuck with kids I never wanted and a hysterical wife I can't stand.

(Anyway,  still hurt for the lost years and yes, she was the love of my life)



---

EDIT: People are asking why I didn’t just get a vasectomy if I was so sure I didn’t want kids. And honestly… you’re right. There’s a longer story behind it, but in short: I seriously considered it when I was 23, but my parents scared the hell out of me—saying I could die or end up paralyzed (yeah, totally exaggerated). So I put it off. That was on me. I was already old enough to do my own research, but I didn’t. My fault. I was also under a lot of pressure from a family that wasn’t exactly helpful—they wanted grandkids, a wedding, a “normal” life, and that messed with my head more than I’d like to admit.

Yes, we used protection , but now I see how naive I was. I was never 100% sure she was still on the pill, and I just kept going like it was all fine. That was irresponsible, I admit it. I’m not proud of it. The one thing I always knew for sure was that I didn’t want to be a father. And I stand by that. I will go for a vasectomy in the not too distant future.

Just to be clear, I’m not going into details about my sex life, but I did use condoms most of the time

EDIT 2 : 

After reading the comments and doing some more research, I'll do it as soon as possible. It's a promise to myself and with this post. I was thinking of doing it before 2026, but the sooner the better.

1jnrxc8,offmychest,I hate the sounds my brothers with autism make. I wish they were never born.,"
I have twin brothers with autism that are both in their late teens and I despise the constant, repetitive sounds they make.

One of them can’t say actual words and makes weird buzzing sounds, like a bee mixed with a gorilla grunt. The other one can talk but asks non-stop idiotic questions and when he’s focusing on his video games, he makes a constant humming sound with his tongue out of his mouth for hours. 

I feel bad for them every time I visit my parents, recently I’ve been stuck living with my parents for 2 months until I can get back on my feet, and my brothers are driving me crazy. The pity I feel towards them is not enough to make me like them. 

I know I’m a terrible piece of shit person for confessing this, but I resent my brothers for ruining our family’s lives. My father couldn’t get his dream job and ended up being a stay at home dad to care for them while my mother works a job that’s different from what she wanted in order to pay for my brother’s care. They are struggling financially but doing better recently. 

I should be a loving brother and offer to stay to better support my family financially, but tbh, I haven’t offered and I cannot wait to be out on my own again far away from my family specifically because I hate how annoying and disruptive my autistic brothers behave. I’m tired of one of them walking around with his dick out 24/7 because he’s nonverbal and my parents refuse to discipline them. 

I feel like they ruined a significant portion of my childhood and affected my adult life.

It’s not right, but I hate them. I’m probably going to hell for it. At least I’m polite in front of them. ",2637,0.94,2637,0,2817.0,180.0,171,1743384249.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jnrxc8/i_hate_the_sounds_my_brothers_with_autism_make_i/,False,True
1ibl3p8,offmychest,My girlfriend's friends turned me into their dating experiment. Never thought I'd learn this much about talking to women,"Been sitting on this for weeks. Finally decided to post.

I used to be terrible at talking to women. Not the funny kind of bad. The kind where you see a cute girl and your brain just stops working. Dating apps were a nightmare. Every match felt like a final exam I wasn't ready for.

Somehow, met my girlfriend at my buddy's party last year. Damn. I still don't know how.

Here's where it gets interesting. Her friends found out how bad I was with women before her. They saw some of my old conversations over drinks. The roasting was so brutal.  
""Why do you write like you're applying for a job?""  
""Are you trying to date or submit a thesis?""

But then they got curious. Started asking about why I wrote messages that way. What I was thinking. What I was afraid of. Turned into this whole thing where they'd break down what I did wrong and why.

The craziest part? Having a safe space to mess up and learn changed everything. These girls would give me scenarios, tell me what they'd think reading different messages. Real feedback, no sugar coating.

Looking back, I wish I had this kind of practice before. Somewhere to learn without the fear of messing up real conversations. Would have saved me years of being that awkward guy. I am still awkward but at least I have a girlfriend now and can at least talk to over 5 women.

Just wanted to share. ",2631,0.99,2631,0,2658.0,27.0,54,1738014439.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ibl3p8/my_girlfriends_friends_turned_me_into_their/,False,True
1o1vyyw,offmychest,"My husband asked for an open marriage, I asked for a divorce","We had a week vacation planned to visit my grandmother for her 80th birthday. The day before we were supposed to fly out I noticed his face looked worried so I asked him, “It looks like you’re about to break up with me” and I laughed and asked him what was going on. He asked me to sit down and listen to him. He started with “Remember how you told me that your grandpa cheated on your grandmother and how despite that they’ve stayed together for a long time….” The conversation continued and he basically said he wanted an open marriage. He told me that a month prior he had joined a discord and met someone, he was her sub and she was his dom. He said he wanted to pursue this and that if I didn’t want to we could go our separate ways. Not once did he mention that he would drop her and stay with me. He let me go through the messages where he declared his desire for her no matter the consequences. 

I'm sorry. I promise you it won't be a problem.
Isabel l feel deep in my soul that I'm meant to pursue you.
Its an unwavering feeling that just keeps coming back.
And I'm fully prepared to take that risk
That I might lose something to gain something better. 

I kept reading further and their messages got more into role play. 

He told me that he had sent her $300 dollars and how he was going to buy her a phone. He bought her the newest iPhone. He said he had also sent other women money, but he didn’t tell me how much. 

I went numb. I still had to pack. I still had homework to do. 

I asked him to leave and be gone from our home by the time I was back. 

We continued to communicate via text message and I tried to ask him questions but he ended up stonewalling me. He said he told me everything and that he doesn’t owe me any more information on the subject and that it’s his own private matter. I asked him, how can it be a private matter when we’re married, but he never responded. 

I’m heartbroken, I am angry, and I am confused. There is no one in my life I can tell the details to, it’s fucking embarrassing. Him having a midlife crisis at 27. We’ve been together for almost 9 years and we have a 5 year old daughter. 

I have yet to figure out what I am supposed to do. I am going to school to become a nurse and I work 12 hour shifts on the weekends. I am also on the other side of the country trying to figure it all out before my return. 

Update:
My relationship is over. I will be using him to pay off and finish my schooling. I need to get a better job that allows me more flexibility. I’m fucking torn. He’s not sorry. I discovered he’s been talking to more than one girl. This one is just the most recent one. He has been talking to this other girl for almost two years. I’m just devastated. He admitted he never wanted to be a father or married. He hasn’t shed a single tear. I feel fucking stuck. Financially. Emotionally. I don’t have any family here.

Two years ago my sister passed from thymoma, she has twins who were 3 at the time.
Her husband (Dan) handled it really well.
He's since then been a model dad in every way. We became close, as I'd help look after the twins, help him out and generally be there. 
About 6 months into this an old friend of his visited and seeing us asked if I'm his wife, they weren't aware my sister had passed.
Ever since then I've been seeing more and more of what I want from a partner, in him, and have even rejected others because of it.

I feel like telling him would end in rejection and ruining our relation. My mother (she's known him since he was 15, treats him like her own son) told him she wants him to start dating, this makes it even harder as he was opposed to it and still kind of is.

1nkdk67,offmychest,My husband could hear again after 20 years,"My husband (41M) had an accident when he was in college that left his right ear completely deaf and his jaw broken. A few months ago, I was able to convince him to do a hearing test and see if a hearing aid could fix his hearing or at least help with the tinnitus.

The hearing aid specialist, who is a hero in our eyes, found some anomalies in my husband’s test results and told us to see an ENT cause the issues seem to be from a physical trauma and not nerve damage.

Luckily we were able to see an Otologist who told us that yes, you can indeed hear again through surgery (which is an easy, outpatient surgery) or a hearing aid which can yield the same results. We opted for the latter first. And yes we were both stunned with the revelation that he could hear again! 

Finally his hearing aid arrived yesterday and the whole moment was exciting yet tense.. he got it fitted and calibrated and then he just started crying. And I cried and the hearing aid specialist cried too.. it was such a special moment to see my husband hear the world properly again for the first time in 20 years.

1hqzg07,offmychest,We lost all our friends when one couple divorced,"For over a decade my spouse and I were part of a tight knit group of 6 couples. We all went through a lot of life together — new careers, struggles with getting pregnant, multiple childbirths, and a severe cancer scare. 

Through it all we shared everything, told each other how thankful we were for one another, and joked how we’d be 85 years old still playing poker together at the nursing home. 

It was all great until it wasn’t. Cracks started to show in one couple’s marriage, which led to an affair, which led to a divorce.

As this divorcing couple tried to pick up the pieces, my spouse and I tried to lend a listening ear and a supportive hand to each of them. These were our friends. Regardless of whose “fault” it was, they deserved the human decency of care through the most difficult time in their lives. That’s what we thought anyways. 

But nobody told us the unwritten rule that you’re supposed to choose sides in a divorce. That’s what everyone else did. Two couples sided with the guy, the other two with the girl. And the divorcing couple? They both assumed we were on the other one’s side, so therefore we were on neither of their sides. 

Now the friend group is split, and no one talks to the other side. We had 10 best friends for life and now we don’t. 

It’s not like anyone ever had this conversation with us directly. It just happened gradually. We stopped being invited to things. Requests to lunch went unreturned. Texts unanswered. 

But they still feign being friends. They still  “like” our instagram posts. They say an obligatory “thanks” in response to a happy birthday text. But never anything proactive. No one ever reaches out to us. And no one has ever been honest with us — we’ve just had to piece the truth together over time. 

I just think the whole thing is stupid. I’ve tried to move on — we have made some new friends, and tried to reinvest our lives elsewhere. But every once in a while late at night I think about this whole situation and it just pisses me off. 

One couple divorced, our closest friends ghosted us, and I’m just done with it.

Also, I’ve taken some heat here for “by not taking a side I’m siding with the cheating partner”. Fair point, perhaps hard to hear, but it’s helped give some perspective to the situation.

She said she talked to her Dr and was waiting for them to call back. I told her let me know if I needed to come get her or not. An hour later she says they told her it is probably nothing but she wanted to go home. I go to pick her up and when I get there, she’s in tears, and can’t move her arms, and can’t feel/move her fingers. As we walk outside, I told her we’re going to ER. We get to ER and between work and ER, she can no longer feel her legs, and they are uncontrollably spasming every 3-5 seconds. They call a med alert (or something like that) crew and they lift her out of the car and onto a stretcher. We go inside and they check her out and do ultrasound and say baby is fine (strong heart beat). Couple hours later they get her into an MRI and check out her spine (C and T). The results come back clear with no visible signs of damage. We’ve been here for 36 hours and they are clueless (neurologist’s exact word) as to what is going on. She can’t feel or move anything below her chest. She can move her arms up to her wrists but can’t move her fingers (no twitch, no squeeze, or anything else). The Dr is saying she doesn’t think it will be lasting but she can’t guarantee anything. 

At this time, I’m terrified and beyond scared that she may not walk again or have any use of her extremities. I’m trying to stay calm and strong for her but when she sleeps I find myself, more often than not, in tears. I walked downstairs, and broke down talking to a stranger and he stopped me and gave me a hug and I couldn’t help but cling to him (probably longer than he would have liked). If you’re a praying person please send one our way. 

UPDATES:

We discussed GBS with the neurologist and Dr. both agreed to rule it out. Their reasoning was this was rapidly on-set not gradually. It also started in her hands/arms and later moved to her legs/feet. GBS generally starts over time and in the feet first and then works upwards. 

I asked about Transverse Myelitis, they ruled it out also but don’t remember the reasoning. 

They are performing a Lumbar MRI currently. The neurologist wanted to get a complete picture of everything to help rule things out. He also ordered a LP to rule out things like meningitis.

When I was home, I used to get annoyed at her sometimes. Like when she asked me to take out the trash or kept checking if I had eaten. Now I get it. She was doing everything, and I barely noticed.

I called her today just to talk and say thank you. She didn’t make a big deal out of it. Just asked if I was eating properly and told me not to skip breakfast.

Man, I miss her. I don’t think I said thank you enough when I lived with her.

No wonder moms are the best.

EDIT: Wow. I never expected this post to reach so many people. Got so much support &amp; love from all around the world. So grateful for this. My mom would definitely be proud seeing this.   
  
Also, some folks (especially college freshmen) messaged me asking how I’ve been handling life after moving out. So here are a few things that helped me:

1. Start small with routines. Just making your bed in the morning or doing a 5-minute room clean-up can seriously boost your mental energy.  
2. Meal prep once a week. Learn a couple of easy recipes and prep 2–3 meals in advance. Saved me so many late nights and way less junk food.  
3. Use a shared calendar. Whether it's for laundry day, assignment deadlines, or remembering to call home, having it all in one place keeps life less chaotic.  
4. Get a handle on credit and money early. Fizz helped me not screw up my credit like a lot of my classmates did. I dodged overdraft fees and a dumb $29 subscription I forgot to cancel. It’s way easier when something’s tracking all that and helping you build credit safely.  
5. Say no to stuff you can’t afford. It’s okay to miss a dinner out or a trip if it messes up your budget. Real friends understand.  
6. Keep in touch with family. Even a short voice note or call can help you stay grounded. My mom still reminds me to eat breakfast and I lowkey need it.  
7. Give yourself grace. You’re not gonna get it all right at once. Nobody does. But if you're trying, that counts for a lot more than you think.  

Thanks again for all the love. If you’re out there trying your best, just know you’re not alone. ❤️

1oktpqj,offmychest,"My son keeps calling me a “Hamite,” “Edomite,” and other biblical insults, I’ve completely lost it","I (34M) have officially lost my patience. My teenage son (17) has recently gotten way too deep into some weird corners of the internet. I don’t even know what rabbit hole he fell into, but now he keeps calling me a “Hamit,” “Edomite,” and sometimes “descendant of Esau” whenever we argue.

Like, what?? I didn’t even know what half of that meant until I googled it and realized he’s throwing ancient biblical lineage slurs at me. He says it with this smug tone, like he’s unlocked the “real truth” about who is chosen and who is cursed.

Last night, we were literally arguing about chores, CHORES, and he looks me dead in the eye and says, “That’s exactly what an Edomite would say.”  
I almost dropped my drink.

I tried to have a serious talk with him, but he just doubles down and says I’m “spiritually blind” and “mixed with nations that the Most High rejected.”  
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN??

I feel like I’m living in some kind of biblical cosplay cult, and my own son is the high priest.

I told him if he says “Hamite” to me one more time, he can start paying rent. He just smirked and said, “Spoken like a true Edomite.”

1kkq5xb,offmychest,Privatized health insurance killed my brother,"When my brother was 15 back in 2002 he had stomach pains, our insurance company kept denying MRI scans for him because he was young and it was “probably a pulled muscle” for 6 months they kept denying his claims until eventually you could physically see a lump in his stomach, by then he had stage 4 Leiomyosarcoma and a 0% chance of survival. 

He did chemo until he was 18, that’s when he was no longer eligible to be on my parent’s health insurance plan since this was pre Obama care.

1. The woman who’s celebrating with her husband who is being investigated because he was having an affair with a local elementary school teacher, got her addicted to meth, gave her so much that she OD’d, pushed her body out of his car at the emergency room and drove off, and she ended up dying, leaving behind an orphaned 8 year old son.


2. The mid 20 year old girl who got a DUI because she got shitfaced and couldn’t find her car, so she called the cops and reported it stolen, eventually found it and drove away, only to get pulled over for driving a vehicle that was reported stolen. She got handcuffed and flashed her breasts to about a hundred onlookers.


3. The local former cop who had a reputation for preying on middle school and high school girls. He would pull over freshly 16 year olds to the point that their parents had to tell them not to drive alone at night. Oh and his wife and her dad got convicted for embezzlement previously.

I hate this country haha

Edit: if three isn’t a big enough sample size:

4. The boss I had who would reminisce to me about the times he went to visit factories he leased in China and how he would throw US dollars at workers and watch them fight over them.

5. The hotel tycoon who owns 80% of the town, exploits his workers, and regularly scams and cons  guests out of their money, keeps the town impoverished, and was so bad that he got investigated by the states AG.

6.  Gay former meth addict who has been arrested twice for buying meth and convicted once for sexually assaulting a woman.

I asked her how she knew that Id like everything she got me and she laughed and said ""because I listen when you talk""

1j8x0ci,offmychest,My ex wrote me an email I discovered four years later,"I've had my Gmail since I was a sophomore in high school, so over ten years. It recently told me that my inbox was completely full, so I went through and deleted them, but made sure to look through and see if any were considered important.

While doing this, I noticed an unopened email from my ex that was sent to me a few months after he broke up with me four years ago. 

The breakup was messy. He ended things because he was too busy for me and ""had to pick something to let go"" which messed me up mentally. A week later he had a new gf, so if I had seen that email back then, I would've lost my mind cause it took me a long time to get over that. 

The email starts with him explaining his side and that he believed the break up was something we both wanted. He went on to say that he started talking to his gf a few months before he ended things with me due to loneliness and had no clue he'd like her, so he broke it off with me to be with her. (I never knew this was the reason he ended things)

He then went on asking why I didn't talk to him anymore and was hurt I didn't reach out to him for his birthday and why I wasn't taking this well because he thought I was okay with us breaking up. We were together for three years before he ended things. 

He ended the email asking if we could talk soon about us and that he wanted us to be civil and for me to ""accept changes but not to forget my best friend"" that part really would've messed me up if I read that months after he ended things. 


Obviously I'm not going to respond and I have no feelings for him whatsoever nor have any idea what he's up to, but I do find it funny he sent this email months after the break up and I never saw it until now. I have no clue how

1how4hb,offmychest,I never realized how privileged I really am,"TW - parental abuse and neglect

I (26 F) grew up in a very small town with a huge family. I am third child in a nine child family. We were always one tragedy away from foster care. My mother mentally just checked out and our father was an alcoholic who turned physically abusive. 

My oldest brother left as soon as he turned 18 and never looked back. Got a full ride to college on football. His leaving broke my mother completely she just started existing after that. Fully ignored all of the children. 

Drew (2nd oldest) just took over the next day. Overnight he was our parent even though he was just 15 yrs old. He earned money however he could. Took our responsibility completely - went to our meetings, came to our games and plays, got us through everything. I have no idea how he did it but he did. 

I never considered myself privileged until I got into med school and came to the city. Everytime the CPS bought in a child, I realized how good I had it.

My father was abusive but Drew never let him beat any of us. We were poor as hell but our brother made sure we were always clothed and fed.He worked everyday but he still showed up at whatever we did - plays, exhibitions, games. We always had a cake for birthday and presents for Christmas. our mother never even picked the younger ones but my brother made sure we all knew that we were loved and worth it. Most of all, even though we had nothing, my brother gave us the freedom and confidence to dream. I am a doctor, my siblings followed their dreams to from  law to modeling. We all did it. 

My brother gave up everything to make sure that we became something. He stayed in closet for years until all of us were out of the town.

So I've been acting dumb the past few weeks. And I asked him, ""Do you hate me because I'm not rich?"" 

He said ""No, I understand you had a harder up bringing especially with your dad opening up credit cards under you name and that messed up your credit."" 

But in the back of my mind I keep hearing what his friend told me. The screen shot I have in my phone that shows him texting him saying ""I think I low key hate my wife for being poor."" Followed by ""We both need some fucking HELP"" 

I feel numb and betrayed. I make $78k annually and am due for a pay increase this month. I do have a lot of debt from school loans and he's helped me with $4k for my credit card. But everything else I've paid for myself. I don't consider myself poor.

I got into my dream law school but that means I'll need to move to NY. And everything I've been doing is to ensure we have a comfortable future together. 

I'm heartbroken. I really loved this man. I wanted him to be part of my future but I can't even stomach looking at him anymore. 

***Update as of 5/27/25
I'm not sure how many of you are curious. But I felt the need to update everyone on what happened after I confronted my husband about the text. 

Throughout the whole time I knew about the text I maintained my composure. Kind of just waiting for the right time to bring it up and not explode with emotion. 

Ultimately, I still was pretty emotional and cried like a baby because he told me he feels financially taken advantage of. It caught me off guard. 

My eyes were already welling up and I asked, ""How? I pay for everything myself. My own clothes, my healthcare, my dental care, my trips--everything"". He felt taken advantage of because when we eat out together he pays. And that's when I told him I knew about the text saying he low-key hates me for being poor. 

We came to no resolution. 

I married an avoidant. 

I tried bringing it up again after the weekend and he said,  ""I don't want to talk about my feelings right now.""

Last summer, I was raped by a stranger. I was walking to my car in a parking lot late at night when a man I had never met grabbed me from behind. He dragged me behind a dumpster, beat me, and anally raped me. He didn't use a condom or lube. It was probably the most painful thing I have ever experienced. The whole time he was doing it, he degraded me for being what he called ""a rich college girl.""

When he was done, my anus was torn and bleeding. He left me there behind the dumpster and I have not seen him since.

Flash forward a couple months, and I start to have all sorts of weird medical problems. Throat infections, constant colds, etc etc. I'm not someone who gets sick very often, so I went to the doctor. They did some blood work and I tested positive for HIV. 

I know my rapist was the one who gave it to me. I never had sex before that, and anal sex has the highest risk of transmission for that kind of stuff.

I feel so fucking sick and disgusting. It wasn't enough for him to rape me, he also had to give me a disease that I will have to live with for the rest of my fucking life. If I ever try to start dating, I'll have to relive my trauma and disclose the fact that I have HIV.

1k33k9u,offmychest,I provided my buddies name falsely to the cops in 1976 and weeks later he was found hung in the Pasadena TX city jail cell.,"I’ve been holding this in for almost 50 years, and I  finally got to the point where I just needed to say it. I don’t care if people believe me or not. I need to get this off my chest.

Back in 1976, I was about 17 years old. There was this kid I knew, Danny Lynn Stevens. We grew up in the same area in Pasadena, Texas. A few weeks before everything happened, he and I got into it over some money he owed me. He hit me in the face with a Zippo lighter — busted my nose open. I was pissed off. I didn’t let it go.

Not long after that, I got picked up by Pasadena cops. A car had been reported stolen and found wrecked not far from where I was walking. They figured I was involved. Started asking me who was driving it.

Still mad about what happened with Danny, I gave them his name. But it wasn’t him. I knew it wasn’t him. It was another kid I knew who actually took the car — but they never found that guy.

Couple months later, I was in court for a setting on an unrelated case when Out of nowhere, a detective walked up to me with a photo and asked, “Is this the guy who was driving the car?”

It was Danny’s photo 

I told the truth. I said no.

And then he goes, “Don’t worry about it. He’s dead anyway.”

I was just shocked I didn’t know what to do. I panicked. So I said, “Yeah, that’s him.”

He said “okay” like that’s all he was looking to hear and walked off like it was nothing.

And that was the last anyone ever said to me about Danny Stevens like they just swept his death under the rug.

I only found a short newspaper clipping saying he hanged himself in a padded cell using a straitjacket strap. He’d been arrested for suspicion of auto burglary. That was it.

No investigation. No real autopsy I could find. No paperwork. Just some tiny newspaper clip saying he died.

I’ve never believed he killed himself. He wasn’t that kind of kid. He wasn’t crazy. He wasn’t in deep trouble or anything. Auto burglary doesn’t equal suicide. I’ve always thought they beat him or choked him trying to get a confession and it went too far.

And yeah — I was the one who gave them his name. That’s been with me every day since.

What really made it worse is that a few years later, in 1981, they did the same kind of thing to me. Picked me up again, took me behind the jail, choked me, tried to force me to give up someone else’s name. I didn’t say a word. Not after what they did to Danny. I didn’t trust them and ironically the person they wanted me to name was the person who actually stole the car in 1976 and i didn’t trust them not to kill him. I Still don’t trust them at all. 

And now, after all these years, I finally spoke about it at the Pasadena City Council meeting. I told them everything. I’m filing a Texas Public Information Act request to get any record — anything at all — about Danny’s death. Because I’ve looked. And there’s just nothing.

Until the city shows me a single report, a single piece of paperwork, then I have every reason to believe they killed him. And I don’t think I’m wrong.

I was just a dumb kid who gave them a name out of spite. And someone died. And I’ve lived with that.

It’s time people knew what happened. Or at least started asking.

1iao215,offmychest,I feel I’m becoming racist and I don’t want to be.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I guess I’m just posting for emotional guidance or to see if anyone has experienced similar things and been able to seek treatment to fix it.

I’m a white male. I live in Chicago. I work a professional job as a civil attorney. 

I grew up in forster care. My forever family who adopted me also had two adopted black children, my brothers

I never felt like I had a racist bone in my body. But over the last year I have had two really traumatic incidents involving black men and it’s turned me resentful and made me afraid of them.

I want to preference and say it’s not all black people. My best friend at my firm is black. But I’m referring to I guess “hood culture”. I’ll explain below. 

Earlier this year (April) I was robbed at gun point getting off the CTA by 2 young black males with guns. It was obviously nerve wrecking but I gave up my wallet, phone, etc and lived.

It was hard to get over that. Recently I just survived a car jacking. I was at a light and a car behind me bumped me (learned this is a common tactic to get you out). Before I could get all the way out I saw three black males with hoodies jumping out of the car. I saw at least one gun. I speed out of there through a red light while calling the police. 

 This is has left me traumatized in a way. It’s also left me hateful. Like when I see a black male who is dressed a certain way I feel my anxiety shoot up and I get scared. After they pass and nothing happens then I start to feel hate.

Yesterday driving on 94 through the south side heading north I saw a car behind me swerving in and out of thick traffic going at 90+. I see the driver is a black male maybe 30-40 years old.
He was driving like a straight formula one driver. Up ahead I see him cutting through people causing a three car pile up as a car legally lane changing almost got him by, tried to avoid it and then got into a pile. The black driver speed off still driving just as crazy.  


I’m feeling so much anger and fear. I’m going to seek mental health treatment as I don’t want to be racist. It’s shameful to even admit to a therapist.

Has anyone else had similar things happen and were you able to recover and not fall into the pit of racism?

1iibd2s,offmychest,Men never think you’ll leave until you do,"I just ended things with my fiancé yesterday with whom I was engaged for 6 months, together with for 7 years and living with for 3 years. Every year I felt I sunk deeper and deeper into the quicksand which was my life with him. We wanted different things, towards the end he treated me like shit, had a problem with everything I did (if I was cutting food in the kitchen the wrong way, if I didn’t put the cups on the right shelves, if I didn’t fold the sheets exactly right). We disagreed on fundamental things, we fought left and right, it got to a point where I was crying one day from stress from an argument we were having and he said “I’m going to punch you in the face if you don’t stop crying.” That was the moment it clicked for me. I’m leaving. I’m done. I stayed at my parents house for a week, yesterday I asked him to talk. I went over there and said we’re done. I could tell he was shocked. It makes me wonder why men push and pull until women break. They push the limits until they reach a ceiling. They walk all over you until you stand the fuck up. I can’t believe the strength I’ve mustered together.

1onsmze,offmychest,"I inherited $200,000 and I’m hiding it from everyone because I’m scared","A few months ago my aunt passed away and left me $200,000. It was completely unexpected. She didn’t have kids and we were close but I never imagined something like that. And ever since I’ve been lying about my financial situation. Telling friends and family I’m still broke, still struggling, still living paycheck to paycheck... Because the thought of people treating me differently terrifies me. I’ve watched money destroy relationships. I’ve seen how quickly people feel entitled to what isn’t theirs. I don’t want to be judged for every purchase. I don’t want to be seen as a piggy bank or a financial safety net. I don’t want the guilt trips. I don’t want the resentment. So I’m sitting on this giant secret. It should feel like security and relief but mostly it feels like isolation. I can’t talk to anyone about the stress of managing it or figuring out how not to screw it up. If I make a stupid decision I suffer alone. If I make a smart one no one can celebrate with me.

Last night I was playing a few rounds of jackpot city and just kept thinking about how messed up it is that something meant to help my life is making me feel more alone than before.

People say money makes life easier. Maybe it does. But it also complicates trust. And right now, telling the truth feels like opening a door I can’t ever close again.

1osbntc,offmychest,I help people steal at the grocery store,"I don’t feel guilty about this at all. I work at a popular grocery store and have seen food prices double with the last few months. And now with SNAP benefits being held back, people literally cannot afford to eat. Food is not a privilege, it’s your right as a human being and I will treat it as so. I can see some have a $1.15 for the month and they’re often homeless teens, moms with little babies, normal people who clearly are just trying to get by. They try and get the best bang for their buck. A few cans of tuna, bread, bananas, simple cheap things that will last the longest. There’s been an increase in people having insufficient funds and unable to buy something as small as $5 worth of food. So I help them steal. I take a few items off their list and just throw it in their bag afterwards. Nothing big, an orange, sardines, a pack of waffles, ETC. I act like it’s completely normal. I don’t mention it. Just super causal. I’m not even sure if some of them notice half the time that I didn’t change them for it. One time a man was hiding a lemon in his beanie in checkout line and it fell out and rolled over to me. I picked it up and handed in back to him and acted like nothing happened. We throw out so much damn food every single day anyways— that’s what I feel guilty about. Wasting perfectly good food bc the package got damaged or there’s a little bruise on the apple. Anyways— I see this as chaotic good. It’s my special little secret.

My whole life is here. My daughter is in our local daycare, we have careers, we have neighbours and friends. 

Is there going to come a day where nobody will pick up my child? That my husband and I will be taken from work, or my mother will be sent back to China with only the clothes on her back?

1k90532,offmychest,My dick is too big.,"Look, this isn’t a brag. I’m doing this on a throwaway for a reason.

My dick is 20cm long, and around 13cm in girth.

Last night, I had a date. It went amazing, we vibed well, and we went back to hers.

We tried, several times, but it wouldn’t fit in her.
This is an issue I’ve faced so many times and I’m so fucking tired.


People think it’s a blessing, and sure, flex away, but holy shit it sucks. I can’t have normal sex with a lot of women, even if I do foreplay for hours just to be able to get a bit further in.


This is not to say I can’t have sex at all, there’s many women I’ve succeeded with after a lot of trial and error, but usually, if she’s short, it won’t work.

She was 150cm tall.


EDIT: Tons of comments about foreplay. Yes, yes I do foreplay, yes, I do keep at it for a while, no, I don’t consider “spit on it and stick it in” as foreplay.

I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s just a mix of mostly getting with shorter women and bad luck. The solution in the end was her riding, which was the best solution, although she couldn’t handle it for long.

Thanks anyway guys, this is an off my chest post, not an advice post. I’ve tried everything you’ve all suggested, as said, just bad luck mixed with my taste in women. Arrivederci.

EDIT2:

At this point the post has two sides, people who don’t believe it and people who have experienced either side of this.

Now, I’m just going to read and respond to comments for shits and giggles because all these discussions are wild.",2224,0.9,2224,0,2502.0,278.0,865,1745746637.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k90532/my_dick_is_too_big/,False,True
1i1c62j,offmychest,I found my rapist on LinkedIn,"Edit 3 but I’m putting it at the top because it’s the most important. I didn’t make this post to ask for advice or criticism on how I’m gonna handle this. I made this post because I wanted to laugh at how ridiculous it is that my rapist is a LinkedIn bro. It is not my moral obligation to do anything but try to heal for my own sake. I wouldn’t tell his last victims it’s their fault I was raped so don’t tell me I have to report it so it doesn’t happened to anyone else. HE SHOULDNT RAPE PEOPLE. 

It’s fucked up and evil but I can also admire how fucking hilarious that statement is. He just knows my first name and body but I have his full name, the company he works for, and a text message from him admitting to raping me. But I just can’t stop laughing over the idea of making a call out post for a rapist on fucking LinkedIn of all places. 

Edit: hey just in case yall forgot, women aren’t the only rape victims and men arent the only rapist. 

Edit 2: this got way more traction than I expected and I really need to address some things. This post wasn’t about exposing him to his job or wife or anything, y’all have really assumed a lot and I think it’s really important to not make those assumptions. I have a text of him confirming it yes, but I deleted my side and there’s no way in hell he kept his so I’d have to subpoena WhatsApp to get it. I have pictures but part of the mutual hobby I keep mentioning is pictures, and I look damn happy in those pictures since it was before he touched me. A rape kit won’t show that my asshole was fingered several days ago, there’s no dna evidence and a rape kit wouldn’t pick up shit now. He works in an industry that “protects their own” so yeah I’m probably not going to expect them to be bastions of protecting rape victims. 

The reality is if there wasn’t so many red flags and demonstrations of lack of understanding consent before, this wasn’t rape and it was just really terrible sex.

People really want to know what the mutual hobby is. I guess it’s relevant that his part of the hobby is photography, my part of it includes being the subject. That part of the night was consensual, so I look happy in these pictures. He didn’t rape me until the camera was down. 

Stop assuming things! Stop telling me to report him! It is not my job to stop him from raping again! I still feel that not doing anything is my best course of action right now. 

But I’ll scratch everyone’s itch for justice when I say I will be telling people. Our hobby is sorta niche and we all gravitate towards the same spaces, and I will be ready. I know his account on that site, and I promise everyone next time I see a post asking if someone wants to take pictures I will comment and let people know he’s unsafe. We were acquaintances before so I feel pretty emboldened to say I don’t think he’s ever going to engage with this hobby again, I really have a feeling my experience is going to haunt him for the rest of his life and I feel good about that. 

I’m going to start blocking you if you tell me it’s my job to report him, or I have a moral obligation to tell the cops. Fuck right off you piece of shit victim blamers. You don’t have all the context and even if you did you don’t get to tell ME how I deal with this trauma. If he has raped people before and they didn’t report it and that lead to my rape on Sunday I wouldn’t fucking blame his prior victims. It’s such a horrible mentality and fuck you all who are suggesting that. 

I don’t know if I’ll keep responding to stuff here. Most of you have offered me exactly what I wanted with this post, made me laugh, told me it wasn’t my fault, screamed at other people for me and I’m super thankful for everyone in those categories. To everyone else you are adding to the trauma of the worst day of my life, making me regret posting this even though for the first 12 or so hours it really helped.

1iqro4a,offmychest,Today I asked my (former) friend why the group ostracized me,"In 2022, I finally made some friends, after 25 years of struggling socially. I was bullied in my childhood and teenage years for being ugly, so I missed out on a lot of social development, which got in the way of connecting with people. This was the first time in my life that I had a friend group.

In the beginning of 2024, I first recognized that they were doing things without me… I brought it up, and we talked about it. At that time I simply thought that they sometimes forgot me due to being in a volunteer organization together which I am not a part of (I cannot join their organization due to other reasons). That’s also what they told me. After we talked, things got a bit better.

Then, in the later summer, I realized it was happening again. I would go on social media, see them all together, and noone had asked me to join. I tried reaching out, suggesting activities, and inviting them. At times, I barely got a reply. During the summer, their volunteer group had a summer break, so I knew it couldn’t be why I was left out again... I finally cracked and sent them a longer message to our group chat about how hurtful this experience was, and that I felt humiliated for having to ask my friends to include me. We had more in-depth talks, and things got better again. I thought, this time things were fine for good.

With the new year, I realized that the same experience is now repeating itself. It was just like last summer. It started when I suggested a game night, and after our plans fell through, they had a game night a few days later… without me. Oftentimes, I would reach out, ask to do something, and barely receive a response. Then I would see them hanging out together on snapchat or instagram. I tried to accept that things change. I tried to take it easy and be okay with it. I tried to show up when I was invited (which was only when other extended friends were invited too) and be good company. Still I continued to see them doing things without me, and it continued to hurt me so deeply. Not like it was a secret either, they posted about their activities, and when I would ask them how the activity was, they would just happily say that it was amazing.

This morning, I once again saw their story post on instagram - this time they had a galentine’s thing together. This was extra rough, because last year they also had one without me, and it was one of the exclusion incidences that we talked about together. Seeing that they repeated the exact same event felt like someone had just ripped apart my entire chest. It was the ultimate evidence that they truly don’t care.

I decided to reach out to the (former) friend from the group whom I could previously best talk to. I decided to message her and let her know that I no longer expect to be included and that I am not asking for an apology or for things to change. I told her that based on these experiences, it appears fairly obvious that I have no longer a space in the group. I asked her to just please tell me what resulted in me being excluded, so that I can take a learning from it and move on in peace.

She has since seen the message and saved it to the chat, but has not replied yet. I take this as that she is thinking over what to tell me. I don’t even feel anxious, I just feel empty. I just wish I could be someone else.",2169,0.99,2169,0,2191.0,22.0,137,1739710709.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iqro4a/today_i_asked_my_former_friend_why_the_group/,False,True

1l6ll2g,offmychest,I started shooting heroin after I found out my girlfriend sucked my friend’s d*ck at a party. I can’t stop.,"I’m 25 and I’ve been using heroin for over a year now. It started after a party, the night I found out my girlfriend, Alisson, disappeared into the bathroom with my so-called friend Jeremy. They never came back out while I was there. Someone told me what happened. She didn’t deny it. Just said, “I was drunk.” That night, I shot up for the first time.

Since then, it’s been a cycle of getting clean and falling back in. My parents have tried everything. Paid for rehab. Took me in. Talked to me for hours. But I keep relapsing. Last time I saw them, they said, “We hope you can mend your life,” and that was it. Now they call maybe once a month. My mom used to cry every time.

My apartment’s a disaster.  Sometimes I stare at old pictures of myself at 15, 16. I used to play baseball. I was decent. I smiled a lot. I miss that kid so much it hurts.

Now, I don’t know if tomorrow I’ll OD. I think about it more than I admit. If it happens, my landlord will probably be the one to find me. Not my parents. Not a friend. Just a guy looking for rent.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. That’s all.

A couple of days ago I got a call, from his wife and she was very distraught. She wanted a tour of his workplace, which I agreed to.  The employees are also upset, so I'm planning a memorial for them a few days later.

When I first started working here a few months ago this employee asked me on a date.  He swore that he was single and had been divorced for decades.  He offered to keep it a 'secret' so that other employees don't know he's dating the boss.

Of course I said no, but when his wife called and I found out that they were married and he was trying to lie to me and cheat on his wife of literally decades I was furious.

I know there's nothing I can say or do and the best thing to do at this point is pretend like it never happened. I don't need to cause his wife and kids more suffering.

1jow5qk,offmychest,"A while ago, I wrote a Reddit post being a bit critical of age gaps and an old dude showed up at my door","Basically, last week I wrote two posts on how I, as a 26 year old woman, am open to age gap relationships both way, but only if the guy is open to dating women his own age. Basically, I would feel gross dating a guy who only goes for younger women. I also said that I personally think anyone in an age gap relationship should ask themselves if their partner would still be with them if they were the same age, and if not, I think it's a bit of a red flag.

Some guys were angry at me, but one in particular began sending messages to me claiming to know me and how I'm a part of the reason that some men suffer bc of loneliness. I didn't take the threats seriously, until a guy showed up yelling horrible things at me at my door.

Everyone was making fun of him for cleaning and I didn’t even think to thank him. I felt like my heart was in my stomach and it made me cry once I was alone.

1nvnzx7,offmychest,My husband made a careless mistake with permanent consequences for our toddler.,"I’m having such a hard time forgiving my careless husband and I’m so angry (though I’ve tried very hard not to let him see that). 

A few days ago my toddler was with my husband while he was moving a folding chair. I was in the kitchen making dinner. My toddler wanted to help with the chair so my husband allowed him to put his hands on the chair without paying much attention to where he was touching it. Husband opened the chair and cause a finger avulsion of my toddlers finger. He lost a nail but there’s no bone damage luckily. 

We’ve talked SO many times about being aware of moving things near his tiny hands and letting him help with things needs to mean basically letting him do it while ALL of our attention is on how toddler is doing it and making sure it’s safe. Yet husband gets annoyed with how long this takes and compromises by letting him touch things while husband does them. 

Now I have to change a bandage daily on my 2 year old with an open wound (couldn’t be stitched completely closed so it a loosely tacked skin flap) while he screams at me, I’m sure he thinks I’m hurting him. I’m devastated that he now has to live with this. Not to mention now having to figure out how to pay a several thousand dollar ER bill. 

My one job is to keep my son safe and I can’t even count on my husband to help me do that. 

ETA
Many of you seem to think this is a pinched finger with a nail that fell off. A finger avulsion is the tearing away of skin, flesh and sometimes bone. Our 2yo fingertip was degloved down to the bone including the nail but luckily not damaging the bone. It is an open wound because there was not enough skin/ tissue left to stitch closed. 

As for my actions- when it happened I focused on son and afterward I reassured my husband that I know it was an accident and he didn’t mean for it to happen. He acknowledged that we’ve spoken before about him being more careful with that type of thing and I chose not comment on that because I didn’t feel it would help anything to do so. That doesn’t mean I’m not still (privately- hence the not letting my husband know) working through my anger and sadness that this happened. Especially while having to change bandages daily while son shrieks and husband tells me to stop tearing up about son crying in pain because he’ll be fine. 

I appreciate those that shared their own similar experiences as the Dr (understandably) was making it very clear that the healing process and potentially lasting affects hold a lot of unknowns.

I don't want advice or suggestions. I'm just needed to get this out because of how angry I am. They know I'm flying to another country to get on a ship but I'm still being told I need to be a team player. This isn't the first time I've treated unfairly at my job because other people have kids.

1l1rikf,offmychest,My girlfriend of 1 year confessed something very disturbing to me.,"(I hope this is the right place to share.)

I’ve been with my girlfriend who has been in therapy for about 8 months. After most sessions, she usually shares some vague ideas about what they talked about. But a few months ago, she told me, ""If I tell you this, you’ll break up with me.""

Unfortunately, I’m a very curious person and insisted a lot, but she kept refusing to tell me. She even said that if she ever told me, she wouldn't want to continue the relationship. So I stopped insisting until today. The topic came up again and I insisted once more. She finally accepted. I deeply regretted it after hearing what she said.

She said that the thing she talked about with her therapist was about something sexual that happened when she was 10, with her brother who was 2–3 years older. I already knew her parents were irresponsible. She said they learned about sex from magazines and decided to try what they saw. According to her, it happened only 3 or 4 times. Even when their older sisters noticed, She didn't do anything to stop it. That part is what hurts me the most.

The world is such a disgusting place. As disturbing as it is that something like this happened, the fact that others turned a blind eye makes me feel even worse.
My perspective on my girlfriend hasn’t changed. I can’t judge her for something she did in ignorance as a child. But I don’t know how to look at her the same way now that I know this.

1npn5dq,offmychest,I hate my lying influencer neighbor,"My neighbor is an influencer who makes her money selling an image but it's all a lie. Her socials show her as a humble mother living a small country life. She has a small home, some land,  amazing views and a lovely old farm house. People always comment about how she makes it look easy and she'll say something like all things are possible with God. People look at her page and it definitely makes it seem like being a mother to 8 kids and running a farm is easy. She even ""homeschools"" all of her kids.  I see mothers in the comments stating that they can barely do it with three they don't know how she does it. She says you just need to have faith and God will give you the strength, that is hard work but a humble life is important. 
Anyway she lives on a $2.Something million dollar property while she owns a second house twice that size on the coast. Her photos are very strategically taken to make the rooms look small,  She has live in nannies, all of her children have tutors, a cleaning staff,  they have people who work the farm and care for the animals and all the photos of her on the land with the old farm house in the distance.. that house, that's my house in the background. She's even flown drones over my property, video that shows up in her pages acting like it's hers(we fit the poor, humble homestead look i guess, where her house screams money so you never see it on her socials). I get that she's selling an image and not a reality.. but i dislike dishonesty and i hate that it feels like we are almost complicit. I hate seeing moms in the comments saying they i think they want to Homestead, but they're worried they can't handle it and her telling them it's not as hard as they would think and suggests they buy her oils to have more energy or help with fatigue.. So they too can have a life like hers. It just gives me the ick so much and i hate to hate anyone but i hate it.

1l50ur6,offmychest,I (35F) phoned a welfare check on my partner (34M) because I thought he’d killed himself. He was cheating on me.,"This happened a few hours ago so apologies for the messiness. 

For background: he has a history of attempting suicide. Or threats of suicide. He also is in remission from cancer. His dad also ODd about a year ago. All this to say he has terrible mental health issues including clinical depression and his last attempt was in October. Last night we were talking about a trial moving in together. 

I (35F) had been speaking to my (now ex) BF (34M) checking in with him throughout the day because he was very unwell. I asked him if it was just a cold or was he concerned it might be something worse. Because he’s terrified of his cancer coming back so I wanted to know what wave length we were on. 

He said not to worry, never directly addressing my concerns. He kept “falling asleep” and not answering me. At around 5.50pm he sent a message saying he “wanted to marry me” so I could “manage his estate” and he had about £8k to leave me but this was goodbye. 

Naturally I panicked. I drove to his house phoning non stop. His door was locked and he lives in a flat above shops. He didn’t answer my texts or calls and I couldn’t get him. I told him to answer or I would have to phone emergency services. No answer. 

I called. They sent police. While standing outside with them he answered my texts and said he was fine but just tired.  I said we’re all outside I need you to come down or phone me to let me know you’re okay. If not, police are going to break the door down. 

No answer. I phoned. I text again. I phoned three more times. No answer. So the door was kicked in. 

There was no one in the flat. It was absolutely empty. I phoned again. I phoned three more times and he picked up and told me to “stop fucking phoning”. Police asked to speak with him and he got very aggressive. They asked if there was anyone else with him they could speak to. 

They put on her. His ex. His ex that has caused me nothing but problems. His ex that he has no excuse to continue to see after their shared dog died. His ex that he’s cheated on me with before. 

They were in a city over from ours absolutely shit faced together. 

I had to speak to her to explain he may need to phone a landlord to fix the now kicked in door. She asked “Why the fuck are you involved in all this?” I didn’t even know how to respond. 

I felt so humiliated that I had to explain that I knew who he was with to police and I could only assume he was having a very good time. 

The police managed to clip his door back in. PVC doors are not strong. That thing just clipped right back into the frame. He was complaining he now had to spend money to fix his door. I told him it was fine and that it was at least secure for now. Although the inside handle has fallen off. 

He replied: “Sound. Now leave me alone.” 

I feel so stupid, hurt, angry and tired. I had surgery on my womb three weeks ago and thought he was the best for not pressuring me about sex. I still have some stitches in and thought he was amazing how he was treating me. 

I don’t know how to think or feel. Part of me wishes I never knew. And I could pretend this never happened. I feel so broken. 

EDIT: I know a lot of people are hung up on the cheating thing. We separated for a long time and didn’t speak. Like I’m talking almost two years. 

And he went to therapy and did the work and genuinely and honestly with my whole heart he was a supportive, kind and caring person for months after we started speaking again. We got back in touch after his dad passed and I felt so sorry for him and wanted to be a good friend. It was months after that we cautiously started seeing one another. And to me it was night and day. He was, in my eyes, changed and genuinely incredibly remorseful. 

I know I sound so stupid for thinking that given the circumstances but I thought the best and believed in second chances. I promise though that chances are limited to two. He is 110% my ex.

1jo83j5,offmychest,My pedo brother is getting married,"My (21f) brother (23 now i think),  just plead guilty to child r*pe of my baby brother, who was 5 at the time, now 10. I was the one that reported it initially when baby brother told me. Obviously super traumatic for everyone involved. Occasionally I e stalk my older brother, J. Last night I found his wedding registry. I knew he has had a girlfriend for a couple years, but this is a big shock. It makes me so angry that he just gets to go on living his life and that he's found someone to love him. I mean they can't even have kids and keep them because he legally cant be around kids. My mom says she knows about his record, but I just cant fathom as a woman being with a man who did that to a 5 yr old boy. 

All I want to do is link his files to her entire family, but honestly I'm scared of him. I dont know what to do. I looked through the girls moms fb last night and its all ""i love my daughter she's my best friend"" and she's a doctor and seems like a pretty normal person. I doubt she knows. 

There will be no long sentence for my brother. Legal system is shit. He's in jail right now but he'll be out in a couple weeks and then just lifetime probation. He only got to jail in February. So, what? He goes to jail for a couple months and then just gets to get married and have a new family?

1in27jy,offmychest,"I’m pregnant and terrified my child will have autism, but I feel like I cannot express that to anyone without being viewed as a bigot","My nephew has “severe”/level 3 autism. He is in his 20s and will live with his parents for the rest of his life. The only food he can prepare for himself is cereal. He cannot be home alone and once school ended, his parents had to rely on state or federally funded day programs that may very well disappear with this administration. He is literally the best version of himself he can possibly be because his parents of course love him very much and would do anything in their power to make his life happy, but his life is HARD. Autism isn’t what makes him special, what makes him “him”; it is not a gift but a crippling impediment. I feel like anyone who dares to express the fear that their future child may have autism is immediately jumped on as being a bigot/not loving their child/etc., and to me that perspective comes from people who themselves have low-needs ASD, or only know people with low-needs ASD.

It feels like even within the autism community, you are only allowed to vent about how much pain and suffering are associated with having a child with high-needs ASD if you are actively experiencing it. Anyone else is accused of being an interloper who thinks the lives of children with ASD are meaningless. 

My husband and I underwent standard genetic testing prior to conceiving, but testing for markers associated with ASD is incredibly expensive and basically meaningless unless your affected family member(s) have genetically inherited ASD. I could never ask my BIL and SIL to submit samples from themselves and their son for genetic testing (paid for by us) to identify any markers because it would be seen as cruel, offensive, and none of our business. I hate that I don’t have access to information that would have a meaningful impact on our own health choices and genetic testing of ourselves or the fetus because we don’t know what to look for. I don’t know what to do with this fear. ",2037,0.95,2037,0,2150.0,113.0,323,1739290356.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1in27jy/im_pregnant_and_terrified_my_child_will_have/,False,True
1lfl5oi,offmychest,I found out something really disturbing from my childhood because of a blacked out line in my autism assessment report,"I just need to get this off my chest because I'm feeling incredibly weird and confused right now.

A few days ago, I was looking through an old psychological report from when I was tested for autism as a 16 year old (turned out I didn't have autism lol). You know how those documents are, lots of official language. But one section had been completely blacked out with a marker. Naturally, my curiosity and a good dose of anxiety kicked in. I held it up to the sunlight, and you wouldn't believe it, I could still read what was underneath.

It was just one line, vague but ominous. It mentioned a ""situation in 4th grade involving a neighbor,"" and how afterward, I became more withdrawn and started struggling more in school. That was it. No details, just a disturbing hint.

So, I asked my mom about it.

And wow, that opened a door I was not expecting.

She started explaining what had been completely erased from my memory. Apparently, when I was around seven, I used to go to a neighbor's house a lot. I went there often, and according to my mom, I once casually told her when she put me in bed to ""tickle me down there because that's what \* did."" I had absolutely no clue at the time that what I said was horrifying. I was just a kid.

That moment apparently shook her to her core. She confronted my dad they were in the middle of a messy relationship anyway. He was cheating on my mom and dropped me off at the neighbor's house so he could clean the house alone. I believe it was so he could see the other woman.  My dad told my mom she didn't have proof and that she should just let me go visit him again. My mom told me she always believed me, since I was just a 7 year old little girl, and asked her the question like it was normal to me. She was furious and went to the police to file a report and kept me far away from the neighbor.

My mom later reflected on something else. She remembered that, at first, the door between the living room and the kitchen was always open, so she could see us when she came to pick me up. But after a while, that door was always closed. At the time, she didn't think anything of it, but after this recent revelation, it all makes so much more sense.

Happily my mom and dad filed for divorce a couple months later.

A teacher even sat down with me afterward and had me draw pictures of what happened. I apparently told her that the man walked around naked. But despite all of that, nothing really happened. No real action was taken since the police couldn't prove it.

The most surreal part of all of this? I had zero memory of any of it. Not a single trace. Not until I read that vague line in the sunlight.

Now I'm kind of spiraling. It's not because I feel damaged, weirdly, I don't. My mom told me that at the time she was advised to not make a big deal about it to me on purpose, since trauma only forms when you know it's wrong or are scared. And it worked.

I even lived across from that man until I was 14, with my dad. I honestly thought I wasn't allowed to visit anymore because I once ""stole too many cookies."" That's the story my mom made up for me to make sense of it. Turns out it was something so much darker.

I feel okay but shocked at the exact same time. I genuinely don't know what to do with this information. I'm grateful my mom tried to protect me, but damn, it's just such a weird kind of shock to discover something so significant. It leaves me with questions like what could’ve possibly happened more? Was it just him touching me or did more happen? 

I'm grateful my mom kept it away from me, and I'm even more grateful that I decided 7 years ago to cut my dad out of my life.

1hxpk5g,offmychest,I think I got attractive and it might be hurting my relationship.,"Buckle in, this is gonna be a long one... So some background details. I (36 M) have been happily 'married' to my wife (34 F) for about 15 years. I shared in a prior story that we met playing Halo 3 and I moved across the country for her. When we first got together I was 21 and she was 19. We aren't married officially. I've never really seen the point in the ceremony as I'm not a religious person. My wife is more spiritual but not religious. She also doesn't feel the need to get married. One of the best things about our relationship is we haven't gotten into a fight one time since we got together. Not one. I'm so grateful to have her in my life.

To explain our situation, four years ago, I was kinda chunky - like a dad bod situation, and my wife had gotten a bit thick due to covid. She isn't a big girl, just a little fluffy. The end of 2021 came around and I got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Honestly, I didn't know much about the disease other than you're not supposed to eat sugar and go easy on the carbs. When I learned all the terrible things that can happen to you because of this condition, I freaked out! Losing your limbs, going blind, losing your hearing, other terrible things. Its all so crazy to me to think about to this day! So I took it serious and started to improve my diet.

My A1C (the average of your sugar levels over the past 3 months if I recall correctly) got much better, my glucose levels averaged around 120, and honestly I did lose a little weight, but balanced out around 200. To be clear, I'm not a tall guy, about 5'6, so even though I lost about 40 lbs over 2 years with proper diet, 200 is still thick at my height. Fortunately my wife is 5'0 so I'm tall to her which we both enjoy. I wanted to lose a bit more weight so I started going to the gym.

I saw immediate returns. Since I was already practically keto out of necessity, my high protein, low carb diet was a perfect match. Over the first year, I lost another 40lbs. 160 is where I stayed for a while. I was losing fat and building muscle at the same time. Now, I'm lean, have muscle tone, and instead of avoiding tight shirts, I wear them intentionally. Also, let me tell you, my love life also improved. Not to give away details, but I last longer, we can do things we couldn't do before, and my wife initiates things more often too. My sugar hasn't been over 120 this whole year and my A1C is exactly where it should be! I'm living a healthy life and enjoying being in my relationship more than ever!

So lets get to the issue. About six months ago I got offered to move from my company to another company. To be clear, I did NOT apply for this job. They reach out to me on linked-in and things for me and my wife changed drastically. First of all, I was no longer working late shift. Second, my salary increased nearly triple what it was! AND lastly, I got a HUGE signing bonus. That signing bonus would change my life.

When I was young, I never got braces. My teeth have always been crooked. This money mean that I could have my smile repaired overnight with a full set of veneers. Now, before everyone jumps on me for destroying my teeth, I also never had the greatest oral hygiene. Not to say it's the worst, but its not great. I've had cavity after cavity filled, a few teeth pulled, a bridge put in, and some chips from an accident when I was kid repaired a few times. This felt like a chance to fix everything at once!

I talked to my wife about the bonus I got and she was so supportive. Again let me share that I first asked if there was anything we could use this for elsewhere. She told me that with my new salary, anything that she wanted could wait. My wife knew how self conscious I was about my smile and she was so excited to let me get a brand new smile. So... I did!

Being a guy... I guess I didn't notice this all that much but apparently women started giving me more and more compliments. Mostly around my style as I do tend to dress a bit more professionally these days for my new role, which I thought was just 'Hey nice outfit'. Of course being thick, I didn't think they were flirting, just being nice. My wife on the other hand saw it very different. When we would go out, waitresses were starting to conversate with me more, some girls apparently were giving me 'bedroom eyes', and again... my dumb self didn't notice that.

I'm already with my soulmate! Why would I care what other girls say to me or how they look at me? Everything I want is waiting for me when I get home from work. The person I want to spend my time with is already waiting to give her time to me! I don't want anyone else. I've been in love for 15 years!

NOW, the trouble. We went to Target so I could pick up the medication for my diabetes and so she could grab Starbucks. After I got my medicine I walked over to where the Keto/Sugar Free snacks are in the health aisle. You know, the Atkins peanut butter cups, Quest chips... you get the idea. A woman who was definitely younger than me walked up to me and asked me if the chocolate covered peanuts I picked up were any good. I started sharing my now wealth of knowledge on these items. We made a few jokes about the taste of some of the stuff, laughed a little, and just had a fun conversation. I then excused myself and told her I had to go find my better half. That was the first time I noticed. She seemed disappointed that I was taken, but didn't say it out loud.

It turns out my wife was hiding on the other side of the aisle THE WHOLE TIME! I found her immediately, was happy to see her, gave her a little kiss, took her hand and we went to check out. Later that night my wife seemed unusually quiet. I do know sometimes when she starts her flow she gets that way so I figured maybe that was happening. My wife then told me she was gonna go back to bed and lay down a bit. Something felt off about it... and after 10 minutes I walked back to see if she was ok.

I found her BALLING into a pillow! Immediately I moved over to her side and started rubbing her back. Of course I asked her what was wrong and she got her self together enough to look up at me with tear filled eyes and with the quietest, meekest voice I've ever heard she said ""Please don't leave me..."" I WAS FLOORED! My heart shattered into 1000 pieces. For the life of me I couldn't figure out what was going on. What did I do to make her think that? I don't stay out late, she knows where I am 100% of the time, we willingly hand each other our phones when the other missing theirs.... To say I was caught of guard was an understatement.

This is when she filled me in on the fact that women in general have been more and more interested in me lately, and that she's seen how some of them look at me like I'm a slab of meat. My mind was blown. I didn't push back but I asked what she meant. Little by little she started to get herself together and explained to me all the attention I've been getting. The looks, the chats, the attention, the approaches. And tonight when that 'busty blonde barbie' was chatting me up, she realized that if I wanted to upgrade... I really could. UPGRADE!? To what? How do you go up from soulmate!?

I immediately told her that I never had any intent of leaving her, or that I wanted to, and if I was flirting I didn't mean too. She reassured me that I wasn't flirting. Bless her heart... My wife explained that she was listening to her husband share his life experience and his passions, not a cheating A-hole trying to get some . We both kinda laughed. We talked for about an hour after that. Eventually, we cuddled, watched a movie, and fell asleep in each others arms.

The last few days have been good. Like really good. But is their anything I can do to make sure the love of my life never feels like I'm going to leave her? I can't stress enough that this woman enhances me. She emboldens my passions, she gives me all that I need and want.... I tell her I love her every morning, I call her beautiful as a greeting, physical touch, kisses, hugs! I'm not distant! I'm active and I want to be with her till I'm old and gray and burying her so that she doesn't have to endure the pain of losing me. Any advice is welcome.

TL:DR
Got diabetes, lost weight, got in shape, got a new job, got new teeth, girls like me, and my wife is terrified I'm going to leave her. Help!

UPDATE: So I've been reading the comments as they've come in and I appreciate the kind remarks. My wife got home about 15 minutes ago and I showed her the post like a few of you suggested. You guys were right. She really appreciated the post. As to getting married, she still thinks it's a goofy tradition made up by religious people and currently just a good way for people to waist a pile of cash. However, one of you posted all the legal benefits to being married and I honestly can't disagree with that. So... we are getting married. But she firmly said ""No dresses, no DJ, no food, no archway. Just a few family members for witnesses and whoever needs to officiate."" I couldn't help but laugh. But I guess we're going on a honeymoon in September around her birthday. She wanted me to pass her thanks along to those of you who offered your support and advice.

1hp77c7,offmychest,My in-laws called my wife and I boujee as an insult but we couldn’t be more proud. ,"My wife and I both grew up poor. We both struggled in primary and secondary school and college was no different. Angel on the tree type of childhood. Neither of our parents had a post-secondary education or the experience to guide us through college, so we fumbled on our own doing the best we could. Student loans, G.I. Bill, student housing, student dining, Maruchan- all those things that make up the American college experience. We worked our asses off in undergrad and poured sweat and tears into both our graduate degrees. So yeah, we make more than either of our parents do/did. And yeah, we treat ourselves at the grocery store sometimes and I can buy a LEGO set here and there without worrying about affording gas or groceries. We earned that shit. But even then, we still barely fall into the upper-middle class. So if being able to indulge in some of our extra appetites is considered boujee, then fuck it - we’re boujee and proud. 

EDIT: Holy shit - I didn’t expect this to get as much attention or support as it has. We really greatly appreciate the support. It’s cathartic to know we’re seen and not alone.

1k38k5f,offmychest,Working at an escape room has made me a more cynical person,"To be clear, it's not because people are dumb.

Escape Rooms are horrible gauges of a person’s intelligence and I wish more people understood that. They're little portals into moon-logic escapes where you decode ciphers and spot clues. It's not normal. It's not supposed to be.

People aren't dumb. But they certainly don't know themselves, and they really don't like each other. And also, yeah, they're dumb. Sometimes.

It's horrifically remarkable how often we see families come into this inherently stressful, timed group activity, who just hate each other. Parents who never should have been married, getting into shouting matches over locks. Berating their children because they read something incorrectly. Kids who just despise their parents. Families who, fundamentally, do not understand each other, or who don't want to be there. Over and over and over.

You ever see a group of people out in public and know the car ride home is going to be tense? We see those situations develop daily. Fathers who cannot muster a modicum of a shit to give about their family, who hardly interact, who resent the rest for having fun, who don't grasp that their kids wouldn't be as into it as they are. Mothers who say the most insane, degrading shit to their daughters so casually. Kids who cry, meltdown, feel so isolated, and no one even notices or cares.

The kids are fine, though. Yeah they can be assholes, and have bewildering logic, and are messy and noisy and hardly listen, but they're kids. The worst is when one kid is really into it, their friends aren't, and the group just turns into a moshpit of teasing, bullying little dudes who would rather be anywhere else. They also break stuff when they're bored which sucks. But I'm not going to hold 6-14 year olds to the same standards as adults. That's insane.

Insane like the basic reading comprehension/enthusiasm of a lot of adults. You ever just see someone fucking deflate because they didn't understand when they booked the room that the clues would be written? How rapidly a person's enjoyment can be perforated and diminished by the mere inclusion of the written word? Also just not knowing words with more than two syllables. Or even READING THE ENTIRE CLUE. I cannot stress how much less stress some of these groups would have if they read the entire clue. It's a paragraph, not a sentence.

And then there's just the normal customer service bullshit that comes with any public-facing employment. People are rude, they don't pay attention to instruction, they don't watch their kids, they're helpless when faced with the notion of abstract thought, yadda yadda, customers are infuriating, you all get it.

All this is to say, the negatives constitute about 10% of the total experience.

So often I get to clock in to a pretend job where I play god over random people and hit switches if they enter codes correctly. I make the magic happen in my little complex of magnets and false doors.

I get to see families come together and find a new hobby. Parents get just as jazzed as the children they're chaperoning when the “you got it right” sound plays. Couples scream and jump and laugh. Kids play and get bewildered by the stagecraft of it all. I see so much emotion in hour-long intervals with utter strangers I feel it has broadened my empathy immeasurably. It's a joyous job.

But the negatives really stick, and I needed to get those off my chest.

1mb6lo2,offmychest,Buying a house made me realize how useless my husband is,"My husband and I have always lived in an apartment and I’ve done all of the cooking and most of the cleaning. His only chores have been to wash dishes and take out the trash. But I was ok with that because we agreed he’ll end up doing all of the home maintenance and renovations when we buy a house. 

Well the time has come and we bought a house 2 weeks ago. We wanted to paint every room before moving in and agreed to split the work to get it done asap. He painted one room and it was awful. He got paint all over the ceiling and baseboards, and even all over the carpet despite having a drop cloth. I had the next few days off of work so I ended up painting the whole house by myself. 

Then I asked him instead of painting to assemble the ikea furniture. He messed it up so the TV stand drawers don’t fit and the bed frame he gave up on altogether because he couldn’t understand the instructions until I came to help finish it. 

When moving he packed the bathroom and threw all of my beauty products and perfumes loose in a hefty trash bag instead of packing them carefully so several of them broke or leaked and there’s a big mess and some things are now ruined. 

Today he told me he’s going to install cabinet hardware, just some handles on the kitchen cabinets. I asked, are you sure you know how to do that? And he told me yeah it’s super easy, I know how. After many hours of working on it i go to check on his progress and he’s only installed 2 handles and they’re super lopsided. Not only that but he left wood dust everywhere for me to clean.

There’s a lot of other examples too but this post would be too long if I listed them all. I feel like all of these are pretty basic things and if he can’t even do that, I definitely can’t trust him to do bigger home renovation projects. He oversold his abilities to me and I wouldn’t have bought this house if I had known because there’s a lot of things I want to change that he said he’d be able to do himself. 

I just needed to vent here because I’ve been losing my mind, and I don’t talk shit about my husband to anyone irl

I always heard things like “don’t trust credit cards” or “debt will ruin your life.” It was drilled into me that the goal is to avoid loans at all costs and only buy things you can afford upfront, but when I grew up and started to learn how the world works, I then looked at how wealthy people actually operate and it’s the total opposite. They take out massive mortgages, business loans, invest with borrowed money, use credit lines and somehow it’s considered smart financial strategy? I remember winning a little chunk of cash a while ago on jackpot city which was enough to clear my credit card balance which I thought that was the smartest thing to do with it, but a friend of mine who works in finance told me he would've done the opposite like he would've kept the card, paid it down slowly and used the money to generate more income.

Seems like they should know why they're preventing you from successfully logging in, but they don't come clean as to why: makes the site seem broken.

I can understand some sites, like banks, wanting to prevent fraudulent connections, but there are plenty of sites that are simple browsing sites, where you're not entering personal information or linking financial info for anything, and they'll still block you if you're on a VPN. So there must be some benefit to them, to not have that VPN-user traffic, and I can't imagine what it is.

Risks are higher than ever, and running without a VPN seems foolish to me.

The history of cooking seems to be relatively short on a geological scale, and the changes to the gastrointestinal system that made humans optimised for cooked and unoptimised for uncooked food somehow managed to overtake a slow-breeding, K-strategic species. 

And I haven't heard of any other primate species currently undergoing the processes that would cause them to become cooking-adapted in a similar period of time.

And when compared to mined diamonds (natural diamonds) the quality is obvious.

Obviously, I don’t own a diamond and I don’t spend too much time searching it up so I cannot claim knowledge about it compared to her but….

In my mind, they are basically same. Where one is formed by conditions of environment and the other one is generated in a lab. The conditions aren’t natural but the by-product should be the same right?

Would your naked eye actually notice the difference? Or when you use the diamond tester it shows significant difference?  

I think essentially she was basing her opinion based on the price between the two because mined diamonds are significantly more expensive (obviously bec of hazard required to acquire it) compared to lab grown. Ergo, the former must be better.

Please explain it to me so I can probably explain it to her (if need arise) without causing any disagreements.

1l35k1r,relationships,"[UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?","I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I ""realized my mistake."" When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

&gt;Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself. 

**TL;DR:** Left my husband, happier than ever.

1ndt5ji,relationships,I am considering leaving my husband over keeping a lock on on of our doors and refusing to open it,"Hi everyone. Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.

Anyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.

Long story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.

Unfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.

I guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps? I have a toddler and a baby coming, and really don't want to have to do this alone if I don't need to.",2289,0.98,2289,0,2337.0,48.0,127,1757545693.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ndt5ji/i_am_considering_leaving_my_husband_over_keeping/,False,True
1nuxztz,relationships,My boyfriend turned me into a baby and I don’t feel like myself anymore,"I (30F) used to be a very independent person. For example, I’ve travelled to over 30 countries all by myself by age 25. I knew how to survive anywhere in the world. My parents were abusive, so I escaped home and lived on my own as soon as I became an adult. I enjoyed living by myself and doing everything by myself.

Then I met my boyfriend (27M) a few years ago. Despite being younger than me, he treats me like a baby and started doing everything for me. He always takes me to work and picks me up after work since I don’t have a car. Without him, I would’ve walked or taken public transport. I’ve always been grateful to him for doing this. Not only that, but he also does all the housework. He does most of grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning and laundry. When we go on a trip, he plans everything.

Life with him was so convenient that I got used to doing nothing by myself in a few years. All my friends say they are jealous that I have such a good boyfriend who does everything for me. I thought so, too. But suddenly I realised that I can’t do anything by myself anymore? When he goes on a business trip and leaves me alone for a week, I find it so stressful and exhausting to do house chores like cooking and cleaning, which I always did by myself before meeting him.

I became much less independent than I was 10 years ago and I don’t feel like myself anymore. On the other hand, I feel like I’m finally receiving the love and treatment I didn’t receive from my parents and it’s compensating my miserable childhood. He says I need to be treated like a baby now because I didn’t have the chance in my childhood.

I’m aware that this isn’t healthy in the long term. What should I change?

TL;DR: I used to be an independent person, but my boyfriend treats me like a baby and does everything for me and now I can’t do things like house chores by myself.

Thank you to everyone who responded to my post and was so compassionate and kind. It was incredible to hear from so many people who actively battle chronic pain/illness and those with loved ones who do. I hope to continue deepening my empathy towards anyone who is struggling with an invisible illness.

On to my update. Armed with some fresh perspectives (and some fresh frustrations, lol) I talked to my boyfriend and told him that he needs to see a doctor or I will no longer be able to support him financially and stand by while he remains unemployed and unmotivated to get the help he needs. I also addressed the idea of managing/balancing his energy levels differently so that we're able to share household responsibilities more effectively, spend quality time together, and keep him doing the things he loves with his friends. 

His response was...really bad. He told me that if I'm not willing to ""step up and clean around the house"" (something I'm already doing) that there's no use living together and that my efforts to clean are the bare minimum and not good enough for his standards anyway. He was also really mad that I haven't taken initiative to take care of yard projects and car repairs. He sat there and spouted off a whole list of things I'm not noticing and cleaning. And, once again, he was focused on this idea that I don't like his friends/am jealous of them and want him spending less time with them, which isn't true at all. 

This really stung. He basically brushed over everything I said and focused on my perceived faults. This told me everything I need to know and I told him I was leaving. He was just...mad. Not sad or hurt at all. I'm still crying excessively over his whole reaction. I still don't know how real or unreal his chronic pain is, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore. 

Thank you again, everyone, for your support and kindness. I'm truly at a loss.

1ngabe5,relationships,My Husband Told Me He’s Filing For Divorce Today,"
My Husband (34M) told me (32F) that he’s fed up and going to file for divorce.  We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.

Backstory: 
My husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years. 

He can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined. 

Anytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.

Pretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.

I thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong. 

Ever since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.

Yesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”. 

It felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive. 

He ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since. 

At this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling. 

He left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.

He came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.” 

I responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce. 

After he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.

I’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.

I’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.

REDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out. 

TL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.

____________________

UPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.

For the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more. 

Since this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:

Daily plan: 
* Morning reflection / meditation
* Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3
* Workout

Weekly plan:
* Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)
* Read 50 pages of self help books: 
    * The Art of Letting Go - read by 10/1
    * The Happiness Trap - read by 10/1
    * Overcoming Retroactive Jealousy - read by 10/15
    * Brain Lock: Overcoming OCD -  read by 10/30 

I told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes. 

I have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself. 

I can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post. So if you’re scrolling and see someone who needs help, just know that your comment can make a big difference. &lt;3

I would never force him to distance himself from his roots but I honestly don’t think I could cope with India for atleast 6 - 8 months a year, he said we could visit NZ yearly apparently. I made a compromise with him that I visit India for three months  a year and he can stay 6-8 months a year. He says life in India would be better for us because we would have more money and he has more connections in business there etc. My husband didn’t agree to this and said where ever and whatever the husband says the wife should follow. He said he Weill buy me a car in India and I can get a job teaching English to pre schoolers. I can only speak the basics on Punjabi and no one in Punjab but his parents and a few of his relatives who don’t speak English anyway. 

I am really conflicted and cry about this often because I feel like I’m going to be giving up my freedom and individuality. 

The times I have stayed in India have been hard at some points as my husbands house is rural and I can’t leave or go anywhere without him. I don’t get to wear what I like and to be honest if I say I don’t want to eat or drink something that is culturally Punjabi I found his family judged me so much. His parents also told me to stop watching English tv shows in the house. I followed their instructions and turned it off but felt super sad after wards. 

I think that maybe I am being selfish for not wanting to live in India but I don’t want to be trapped with no where to go. I think I will go mad. Any insight on my situation would be appreciated. Sorry my paragraphs and words are all over the place, my thoughts in my head and just a mess at the moment.

1ht8ogl,relationships,UPDATE: Boyfriend slept with someone else while we were on a break,"Origional post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Z9RsQy6S1Y

Firstly, thank you for all the useful advice I was given on my original post. I was unable to reply because it was locked but thank you all. 

Since I found out my (39F) boyfriend (40M) of 14 years slept with someone else, I broke up with him. He stayed living in my flat for 2 months (on a tight deadline) so he could find a home as he is jobless. He didn't. He is now homeless. 

His mum pressured me to have him for longer as there is a cold snap here and he's on the streets but I said no. His mum can take him in if she is so worried.

I found out it was the lady he has been spending time with at the gym. I think he wanted to try that to see if it was better.

That is all. I now live alone (with dog). 

TLDR: I chucked him out. He's homeless. ",1658,0.96,1658,0,1730.0,72.0,62,1735973361.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ht8ogl/update_boyfriend_slept_with_someone_else_while_we/,False,True
1kpiccf,relationships,"My husband (63M) goes cycling way too much leaving me, his (60F) wife alone. How do I help him understand he's losing me?","Good people, I need some help.

My husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.  

The last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights. Oh, and works a full-time job on top of this.

Last month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.

This is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.

I'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.

TLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do.

1if13je,relationships,Wife is a whole new person after giving birth. I’m scared i’m going to lose her.,"My wife [30F] gave birth to our daughter 4 months ago. She doesnt work so she is a sahm. She is NOT the same person she was before the baby. Before birth we got into a serious argument maybe once every few months, now it's almost every weekend for almost no reason. Monday we were supposed to have a date night (drinking wine, watching movies, playing games, ends with sexual relations usually I'm (32M) holding her while we're watching a movie and she randomly blew up on me for no reason. Said she's sick of me and doesnt ever want to have sex again then storms out and locks herself in the bedroom. I prioritize her wellbeing. Make sure she's fed, hydrated, doing well mentally when she's with our daughter. She doesn't even seem happy to see me anymore when I'm home from work. Past fights recently have been about how she's not happy with me anymore after i snapped back one time about her nitpicking everything ive been doing recently (she has never once mentioned this before the baby), she's snapped on me because the baby was crying and I couldn't get her to sleep fast enough, also screamed at me because i ran a yellow light with her in the car. When we fight it's really hurtful things being said to me and I'm always saying sorry trying to defuse. I've done maybe 95% of the feedings at night so she can get about 7/8 hours of sleep consecutively and take baby from the moment i return from work so she can get alone time. I also do a lot of the household chores for her and it seems to land on deaf ears. She refuses counseling and won't talk to me about it and doesn't think it's a big deal. It seems like our marriage is close to an end and I'm scared. I care so much about her I hate seeing her like this. Can anyone relate?

1ip4fn9,relationships,Update: I told my boyfriend I loved him right after we had sex. How badly did I mess up?,"Sl I (33f) made a post the other night (which can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/TvHzNz4WpV) about how I’m with my first ever boyfriend (37m) and told him right after we had sex that I loved him and he didn’t immediately say it back so I freaked out and tried to backtrack before shutting him down and saying I wanted to move on. I left shortly after and just shut myself out from him for most of the next day. This morning I got a text message from him that said he misses me and was really loved to go out tonight, so I figured what the hell and we went out. While we were out, there was a moment during dinner that I reached over and held his hand and told him I was sorry I ignored him and told him about my abandonment issues and how self-destructive I can be when I’m scared people will leave me. I’m sure it’ll come as absolutely no shock to anyone that he was lovely and patient with me. We went back to his place and were snuggling and I was starting to fade away to sleep…

…then he said “love you, beautiful” (“beautiful” is his pet name for me. Corny but he says it’s very fitting lol). I stopped and then looked over at him, and then he said “you don’t have to say it back.” I said “but what if I wanna say it back?” and he told me to go ahead and I said “I love you too.” I rolled over on him and gave him a nice long kiss and then put my forehead on his before I started crying a little bit. I cannot tell you how badly I’ve wanted to say that to someone since I was 14 and it doesn’t even feel real. Feels like some dream I had that was nice but didn’t happen.

Riding this emotional high I can’t sleep so I’m writing this while he’s sleeping next to me. I have to get up in four hours to have enough time to go back home and get ready for work, but I don’t care. One bad day of crap sleep is forgettable, I’m gonna remember this night for the rest of my life. It’s way too soon for this, but I’m already getting giddy about putting my name in front of his last name.

So yeah. I’m in love you guys &lt;3

I was working on his computer and his gmail was open and I saw my name so I opened it and it was a Word doc that he journaled.

I think I might faint and need some space. Should I get some distance and go to a hotel for the weekend? I thought we were in a great place.

I feel like I have pissed my life away and this is all that I am entitled to.  I have pissed away all of the good things in my life.""

 ""Someone like \*\*\*\* would never have been able to get to me. When I was younger, I had many opportunities to be with women like her but declined. I am uncertain about whether this is a good thought pattern to have.""

""My mind wanders to places, like what it would have been like if someone like Lauren could have been in my life instead of \*\*\*\*.  Lauren has the advantage of existing in my mind as an ideal.  We never really got the chance to know each other outside of two nights and a week of texting and talking on the phone.  I know that she had a drug past but has been sober for over a decade.  I don’t think she was promiscuous; most guys that I know that knew her in the old days indicated that she didn’t have a lot of men in her life.  That’s not to say that there hasn’t been a lot of darkness in her life. It would have been easier to be with her.  There weren’t all of these men in her orbit like \*\*\*\*.  She was never married, so there was no divorce.  She’s not as emotionally damaged as \*\*\*\*.  In some ways, I feel like being with \*\*\*\* is some sort of karmic thing, like this is what I deserve for being non-committal for most of my life.  I have my own damage.  Everyone likes to think that they are a good person but there are moments when I am not so sure about myself.""

1kto8n4,relationships,"Update: husband has a new chosen family he prioritizes and sees every week, I’m jealous and frustrated","
Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JwBnrT9EL9

It’s been a while since- our little boy is 2.5 now. Thank you to everyone who commented - it was the kick in the butt I needed to lay down the law. Esp the folks that rightly pointed out I was a passive doormat without self respect — that stung but was true.

After my post, I had a big sit down with John on my the things I was upset about. My husband was traveling to be a groomsman for a good friend — I told him to stay out there for an additional week and decide: 
1. if he wanted to stay married and wanted to be a family
2. If he wanted the above, think about what needed to change on his part (not just Pam but other stuff too), how he was going to be a good husband/father going forward
3. Arrange to go over it with me and our marriage counselor on his return

Alternatively, if he didn’t do the above then when he got back we’d start logistics on separation and co-parenting. 

And surprisingly, he did all the above. Apparently he reflected a lot at the wedding (his friend and his wife are such an in love couple) and thought a lot about us and our relationship and what he wanted.

He came back and proposed changes (immediate break from Pam/company and stop to their hobby — he’d play some dnd / mtg online but that was it), he’d take over remaining baby prep (nursery, logistics), and   promised to lay out a post-partum care plan for me and baby. He stuck to his word and also worked hard to regain my trust.

Then we had our son and my husband was over the moon in love. He and baby have been inseparable ever since and have an amazing adventure filled life with all the hobbies (baby/toddler swim, gym, soccer, co-op, and a great local parent community). After our kiddo was born Pam lost interest in my husband anyway (she doesn’t like kids) and shortly thereafter cheated on her poly relationship. Kevin and John have actually become good friends since then, but John is straight so I have no worries there.  And as I’ve reflected — I think I also just actually hated Pam — she’s everything I don’t like relying on men for affirmation, no job/life ambition, frivolous and stupid. And apparently (according to Kevin) the feeling was mutual - she thought I was a controlling, stuck up, robotic ivy league workaholic who didn’t appreciate or support my husbands hobbies/quirks. I was also a lot more emotiobal during pregnancy than normal. My husband- upon reflection liked being needed and admired 

We had a lot to work through with us, but two years later we’re in a great spot (I also had a weird shift in hormones post-partum which made my sex drive really really high which for us helped a lot with our relationship). Didn’t want this to be too long, but there were a lot of changes we implemented to get back to a loving place. John feels a lot of purpose in being a dad and supported me as my career has taken off. Sometimes things are still hard (my job is really high stress, toddlers are a lot of work, etc). 

But we’re pretty happy. We spent this morning snuggling in bed with our toddler and dog pretending we were on a boat, making hair dryer sounds, and giving hugs. We live a pretty boring suburban kind of life - but it works for us.

Thanks everyone for the push for me to stand up for what I wanted and needed.

1lu5363,relationships,[UPDATE] My boyfriend (M25) and I (F23) had an argument that is giving me red flags. Is it enough to end our years long relationship? Please advise.,"I never expected my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/mwDV4nA5GJ
would receive so much attention. All of the events listed below occurred eight months ago, around the time of the OG post. This update is not easy for me to write, but I am moving out of state next week, and want to put this out to finally lay this chapter of my life to rest. 

The argument from the post occurred on Saturday late afternoon. I posted to Reddit a few days later after I hadn't heard from M25. By Wednesday, I placed an order for a small U-Haul truck to move out the following Saturday (the soonest time my family could help), but I still hadn't heard from him. My family thought it best not to tell M25 that I was coming to pick up my belongings until the day of, because we were afraid he would destroy my things. M25 is an extreme minimalist, so all the furniture, decor, tools, etc., came 100% out of my pocket. At that point, I had thousands of dollars worth of belongings in there, and even more invaluable momentos. 

Anyways, Saturday comes around. Still hadn't heard anything on his end. I texted M25 that morning, telling him my parents were coming to remove my belongings and to please be out of the house while they did so. He texted me back, ""No stop telling me what to do"". At this point, he knows they're coming and exactly when. For my safety, I stayed home. When my parents get there, my mother knocks on the door. No answer. Doorbell. No answer. I texted her to go into the garage and see if M25's vehicle is there. The garage opens, and he had thrown my belongings into the garage. Things were scattered about the garage floor. Whatever. They noted that his vehicle was there, though, so he must be inside. My family starts grabbing stuff from the floor and putting it into the truck. 

M25 comes out. My mother said he looked psychotic, almost. He doesn't do drugs and wasn't drinking for health reasons. But he looked off. When he came out, he made it very clear to my mother that he was holding a gun in his sweatpants pocket. He told them to get off his property. My mother asked him if he was alright. Remember, M25 and I had been together for a long time at this point. My family knows him well. This was all such strange behavior from him, and my mother was genuinely concerned. In response, he tells my mom, ""I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?"" My mom asked if she could go inside and get the rest of my belongings. M25 says no. My mother reminds him that I have been without my essentials for a week now (medication, glasses/contacts, work badge, underpants) and asks to step inside for five minutes to retrieve those things. He agrees. 

My mother walks into the house and sees an AR-57 set up in the kitchen, ready to go. She immediately turned around, told everyone outside loading the truck to get in the car, and went home. I spent the next few hours trying to arrange a police escort for the rest of my belongings (in hindsight, we should have done it in the first place). As I was working with that, my mom called the homeowners, AKA M25's parents, who live 2-3 hours away. We tell them everything up to this point, and they're distraught. They say they're on their way. We received a call from the parents later that evening stating that M25 is out of the house and being monitored back at their home. We moved everything out afterwards. 

I get a text from M25 that Sunday, where he essentially says that he didn't know I was breaking up with him. That he was waiting for me to reach out to him while he was reflecting on everything that happened, blah blah. We went back and forth a bit, where I was telling him that he threatened my family and that I couldn't forgive him. He said he wanted to talk about everything, and I told him I wasn't ready for that. I followed it up with a ""You should work on yourself, and if I want to talk, I'll reach out"" type of text. He responded with a bunch of OKs and then, ""Just don't fuck your ex. Hate that guy. Heard really bad things about him"". He's referring to himself here, since he's the only bf I've had. It was super strange and off-putting to receive a joking text like that when a few hours earlier he threatened my family with guns. I ignored him. 

He also sent an interesting apology to my mother. To me, it's a liability thing that his lawyer mother asked him to send. Highlights included, ""I know you felt threatened by what you saw..."" and, ""There is no excuse for having guns out while people are present at my house. Seeing a gun -- concealed or otherwise -- in that sort of situation is enough to shock someone, especially those unfamiliar with these weapons."" and, ""My parents agree and have asked me to give [my guns] up until I am more responsible and careful.""

He texted me again the next day, saying, ""I know I've acted nonchalant about things, and it's not a good habit. I can't continue to live in limbo. I hope you will come over and talk to me in person... false hope is not doing me any good. I need to move on with my life."" Where I responded, ""I do not want to give you false hope, but I'm not in a place of forgiveness. I think it's time that we continue to move on with our separate lives."" This is when he responds with, ""Listen, come talk to me. I feel awful that I used your own love for me as a lever against you. I hate the person who did that to you and everyday I try to bury that part of me"". Lots to digest there. 

We exchanged a few more texts, and I, naively, agreed to have a conversation in person. I would not have it at the house. It would be during the day. And it would be in public. I now understand that I should never have entertained this idea in the first place. I was emotional and confused at that time. I had been with M25 for years at this point, and wanted clarity on what drove him to do this. 

I told him my availability to talk on a Thursday, and he said he wasn't sure if he was available but would let me know. I didn't hear back from him until Thursday at 8:15 pm, when he asked, ""You still coming or no?"". A location hadn't been discussed. It was dark out.

I suggested we meet the following morning. That's when he sends, ""8:30 is late for you now?"" followed by, ""I said your curfew was 1 am, so you're good"" and ""Just get your ass over here and talk, I am not going this 9 am bullshit. Or I will put a scorpion in your bed."" I responded and he texts back, ""I'm omw"". I'm sorry, you're what? At this point, I was in a new safe place in Location A. My mother was in Location B, and my father was in Location C. I had to call everyone and let them know M25 was going to show up at one of their locations, since he knows where they both live. He showed up at Location C, where my father was. My father told me that he was scared for his safety and home. Luckily, nothing happened. M25 waited outside for a bit after texting me ""Here"" and left. 

This whole night rattled me. I stayed up all night, scared he was going to show up at my mom's place next, or mine. I ignored his texts. He started to call. Left an eerily calm, cool, and collected voicemail wondering when we were going to chat. Saying that if I wanted to ""have that conversation, [I, F23, am] welcome to the house whenever."" I texted him back, threatening a restraining order if he made contact again. A month later, he texted, ""Hey, obviously what happened happened. I'm sorry I made you feel unsafe. That's not who I am as a person or who I would wanna be. I wish you the best in whatever you do."" And that is the last I've heard from him. 

All of this could have played out way worse. I'm relieved for the safety of my family and my own. I'm fortunate enough to have gotten out when I did. And yes, I understand things could have been done differently on my end. I learned a lot about myself through this experience. I chose to text M25 in the nonconfrontational way I did for my safety. We live in a small community. I genuinely believe this man is dangerous and could harm my family, my dog, my friends, etc, if I angered him. We're all within a mile or two of each other, and he knows where to find all of them, and me, if he wanted to.

I condensed some of the details for the sake of brevity in this post. I have screenshots of all the texts I quoted above. I'm happy to answer questions in the comments.

TL;DR: My ex-boyfriend (M25) ignored me for an entire week after a concerning argument were I sought advise on what to do (described in the original post). When I went to move out, he threatened my family with weapons. Fake apologies, nonchalant texts, and jokes followed this. When I didn't want to talk, he showed up at my father's house, where he thought he could find me. So, yes, the argument was enough to end a years long relationship.

We hang out together a lot, playing video games, going to Friday Night Magic, watching movies, D&amp;D, and just generally being nerdy. One of the friend group \[34M\], Bruce, has recently gotten a new girlfriend and we've tried to include her in our get togethers. The girlfriend \[33F\], I'll call her Silver, really seems to hate me, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't notice it at first, if I'm honest. She came along to our May the 4th/Return of the 5th party/sleepover, one friend Peter \[35M\] helped her make a paladin to join in on a D&amp;D one-shot when she said she wanted to learn, she's come along to FNM multiple times, etc.

However, the other night, while I was having a passionate debate with another friend, Steve \[36M\] about the atrocity that was Hush 2 from DC Comics, Silver absolutely *lost* it at me. She started yelling about how I was a 'Pick-Me' and how I was mad that she was in the group and that I wanted to sleep with all the boys \[?!?!?!\] but especially Peter. She yelled for like five minutes, while I just sat there like a deer in headlights, because I didn't know what to say? She accused me of making my Warlock sexy in D&amp;D to make the boys want me, that I picked a ""Pretty girl card"" for my deck in Magic, that I tried to ""dress sexy"" for May the 4th. \[I wore an Ahsoka sleeveless tank top, no straps, just sleeveless.\]

I tried to tell her I have no interest in sleeping with Bruce, or any of my guy friends, and she just burst into tears. Peter said that maybe I should go, for now, because she was upset, so I did.

Now, on Discord, a bunch of them \[Peter, Bruce, Steve and Michael (33M) have all said I should apologize to her, with only Clark \[35M\] saying I have nothing to apologize for. There's been a lot of talk about 'keeping the peace,' but I'm not sure what I should apologize for? I didn't make a move on anyone. I haven't slept with or tried to sleep with any of my friends.

I'm not sure what I should do, or what I *can* do. I don't know what to apologize *for* and I feel like my friends are siding with her.

1na4kkq,relationships,UPDATE 6 years later: I (F26) am in love with my best friend (M26) but he thinks a relationship is doomed to fail,"Original post can be found  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dzdykr/i_f26_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_m26_but_he/)

6 years ago I was here lamenting the feelings I caught for my fwb turned best friend (let’s call him Franky).

After the initial pain of rejection, we both agreed to stay best friends. We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).

After 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.

The night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.

We moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.

It’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.

We now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.

TLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together. Celebrating 3 years of bliss and hopefully more to come :)",1012,0.98,1012,0,1033.0,21.0,40,1757177716.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1na4kkq/update_6_years_later_i_f26_am_in_love_with_my/,False,True
1lbjf7f,relationships,My (21f) bf (25m) is going on a week long trip to Italy. How do I not resent him?,"So my bf of 2 years along with 7 of his coworkers got invited by his work to go on a one week trip to Italy. Everything is completely paid for. Meals, flights, excursions, they are renting a private yacht, they’re staying on a mansion on the beach. Literally a trip of a lifetime and he didn’t have to pay a dime

When he first told me I was honestly I was anxious because 7 months ago he had previously did something to break my trust and we were trying to build back. Come about a week away from his trip to Italy I found out that he had an option to bring a +1, expenses all completely paid for as well. literally all their other guys who were going invited their gf/wife. I was the only one left out.

That completely changed how I felt. It wasn’t just a work trip anymore. It felt very personal and left me wondering why he didn’t want to invite me while all the other men had no problem bringing girlfriend along?

When I brought it up he said “he didn’t know it would mean that much to me” and he views it as a “networking and making connections trip and doesn’t want to have to worry about keeping me entertained while he is busy networking and building connections”. Or something along those lines.

He told me I would basically just be sitting in our room the whole time which at least id be sitting in our room in a huge mansion on the beach and private yacht getting fed pasta every night. Instead I’m just sitting at the house.

I feel so hurt and excluded and now he is living his life across the world with him and a bunch of other happy couples while I’m at home trying not to spiral.

I honestly feel a lot of resentment building. He knew I was anxious of him going because of him previously breaking my trust and he knew he had the option to invite me but didn’t. He said he “never considered how id feel and was thinking of it from a different perspective.” Outside of him breaking my trust we have an incredible relationship. We never fight, he pays for my all school/bills, anything I want. Most importantly he is my best friend. And I don’t want to destroy what we have.

My question is am I being over emotional or is this a real red flag? How do I process this and not let it turn into long term resentment?

1mnsxkg,relationships,Dad (60m) is giving all his money to a 21-year-old he met while driving Uber. I’m at a loss.,"

My dad (60m) met a 21-year-old while driving for Uber and now I’m watching what looks like a slow-motion trainwreck.

She told him she was homeless, so he started paying for her hotel, got her a job, bought her a car, and in total has given her around $20k… in just two months. The worst part? He doesn’t have that kind of money. He’s borrowed some from me under false pretenses (which I now know went straight to her), and his credit score is in the 300s.

People have tried to warn him. Her friend called him saying she’s still with her ex and using him. Her ex’s mom said the same thing. Every time, she tells my dad they’re just jealous or dislike her.

It’s beyond surreal. He looks like Danny DeVito (no offense to the man), has nothing in savings, and yet thinks this 21-year-old is with him for love. They’ve known each other two months and he already tattooed her name on him. He’s even had the police recover the car he bought her multiple times—until the last time, when she got him to sign it over to her officially.

He swears she never asks for anything, but somehow he’s hemorrhaged $20k since meeting her. I don’t know how to make him see it. I’m torn between trying to intervene or stepping back until he crashes and then helping pick up the pieces… but it’s getting worse fast.

1ntmfbn,relationships,[Update] I [27F] don’t know how to deal with insecurities from dating bf [28M] who is much more attractive (7 years later),"Ok, a brief, mostly sad update. Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bbvhkg/i_27f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_insecurities/)

We got engaged a year ago, which felt like one of the best days of my life. The universe decided no, and earlier this year I found out my fiance cheated on me in the first months of our relationship and slept with his ex model fling a few times even though he had denied there was anything other than friendship between them. Found out because she still shares mutual friends with him and is in the same field, we were all at an event and she made a snide comment about it after a friend heard about our engagement and congratulated me. 

I can't really put into words how betrayed I felt, our entire relationship built on lies and years of insecurity being validated after I finally put them to rest. We tried working through it, but I decided to break things off because I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again. He made sounds about how it was an early mistake and that I'd be throwing away 5 years of our relationship, but tbh I felt like they never became a thing because she wasn't interested in more, not him. So yeah, I wish I could say all of the ""but he picked you"" comments were correct, but clearly it was too good to be true.

1l17291,relationships,(UPDATE) How do I (47M) tell my boyfriend (35M) that I'm a virgin?,"Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp

Hey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.

Summary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.

I left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.

We had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.

I have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.

Once I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.

I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.

I have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!

1njpi8v,relationships,Should I [F30] warn my coworker [M24] that he is alienating himself socially?,"I [F30] work in a project-based profession. The projects take anywhere from six months to several years and you’re typically working with the same small group for the entire duration. 

As a natural consequence of working closely with the same few people, friendships usually form, and we’ll all take lunch together sometimes or go for drinks after work, that kind of thing. 

We have an especially copacetic group on my current project. We’ve been working together six months and we go out socially, we talk and joke around during the day. We’re not “friends” but it’s a tight knit group as coworkers go. 

We have one coworker [M24] who is alienating himself from the group and I feel awful because he doesn’t seem to be aware of it. 

He’s losing the good faith and camaraderie of everyone in the office and he doesn’t seem to understand why it’s happening. I can see that it’s upsetting to him and it’s unpleasant for too. 

That being said, I don’t know him well at all, and I feel uncomfortable approaching him about the issue. He’s an overall nice guy and has some excellent qualities but they’re overshadowed by his tone deaf conduct. 

The result is the entire team is spending less time together because we wouldn’t host an event with everyone *except* him, but most people also can’t stand to be around him more than they have to. 

Should I say something to him and if so, what should I say? 


His behaviors include but aren’t limited to:


—Acts like he’s the most experienced despite being one of the least; constantly interrupts or gives unsolicited advice to other specialties.


—Minimizes coworkers’ complaints; e.g., when someone said “the client keeps calling me on weekends,” he replied “maybe work harder so they won’t need to.”
	

—Gets angry if anyone uses a nickname version of his (very common) name, even from people who barely know him.


—Went to a bar with us and other teams then spent the whole night lecturing everyone about how he doesn’t drink because he’s healthier and has more willpower.


—Proudly and conspicuously tattled on coworkers for bending the dress code when no clients were around, leading to a companywide memo.



**TL;DR: Younger coworker keeps alienating our tight-knit team with tone-deaf behavior (know-it-all, minimizes complaints, lectures at socials, tattles). He seems unaware. Should I say something?**

1kwt2x5,relationships,I [29F] have lost attraction to my [27NB] disabled partner and I'm at a loss for what to do.,"My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.

They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.

They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.

TL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.",898,0.91,898,0,997.0,99.0,35,1748366458.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kwt2x5/i_29f_have_lost_attraction_to_my_27nb_disabled/,False,True

Hi all -

First off thank you for the overwhelming response to my original post. A lot of you really lifted me up and I got a few good laughs out of it too, so thanks for taking the time out of your day to respond.

I'll keep this very short - I decided to break up with him (shock). Unfortunately his birthday was this past Tuesday so I sat on it for a few days. My best friend's advice was to break up with him on his birthday, that way he'll know I really mean it. I judicially decided to dispense with that nugget of wisdom.

It's actually very hard to pretend everything's ok when you're really just waiting to break up with someone. Nice to know I'm not a total sociopath. Anyway fast forward to last Wednesday (22nd), I was at trivia night with friends - like every Wednesday - where there are no phones allowed. After TWO HOURS I look at my phone and see a message saying ""thanks for ignoring me"". Well I'm a petty \*word that rhymes with witch, pitch, ditch and glitch\* so I decided to actually ignore him. I left him on read until Saturday. You know what happened Saturday? *He came to my house and sat outside my front door for 45 minutes.*

I waited him out (pretended I wasn't home), went for drinks with my best friend, sent him a text calling the whole show off and blocked him everywhere. He hasn't been back to my house since, but I installed one of those doorbell camera jobs - just in case, tie your lace.

Anyway thanks for the kick up the arse, all's well that end's well.

It's my birthday today so pour one out for me and take this as a sign to just do it, whatever it is

1lv689a,relationships,How do I tell my boyfriend I'm not interested in watching his recorded work meetings and AI-generated mega documents?,"My (28F) boyfriend (29M) and I have been together for almost a year. I could go on and on about all the ways we're compatible, and I really adore him. However, I'm running into this issue where I'm not sure if I'd be an asshole to reject what I suppose are my boyfriend's ""bids for attention.""

There are things my boyfriend likes to share with me that I think are awkward and strange for me to be watching or reading. For example, last night, he wanted me to watch his 30-minute performance review that he had recorded. At first I thought he was joking, but he was totally serious. So I did. I sat down and watched a 30-minute conversation between him and his boss. He often insists that I read these long email threads (again, from his work) that demonstrate how well he's doing and tries to get me to watch recorded meetings. He also writes up these insanely long documents (using ChatGPT) to work out plans for how to fix society and the world for the better. At first I actually read them, but now I just skim and pull out high points I can mention so that he will think I read it.

This is AWFUL, I know. But, the couple of times I've told him I'm too tired/busy/etc. to read or watch what he's given or sent me, he has not reacted well. He asks ""if I even care about him"" and gets really pouty and rude. When I try to backtrack and agree to read/watch whatever it is, he tells me that it's too late because I've already shown how I really feel. This is really frustrating, and I try to tell him I'm trying to find a solution that addresses the problem and doesn't attack either of us personally, but he won't have it. A part of me wonders that if I really did love or care about him, I wouldn't feel exhausted and awkward watching and reading what he gives me.

I think the reason this feels off-putting/strange to me is that it feels more like a little kid asking their mom to look over and approve their school project than it does a partner wanting to share something that they're proud of. It's also upsetting because I am a writer, and he's always too busy to read the writing I want to share with him. I've even written erotica about us and poems I'd like him to read, and he says he'll get to reading it, but he never does.

What I'm here to ask is this: how can I either a) gently let my boyfriend down or b) have a productive conversation where we agree to respect and appreciate the things that both of us would like to share? I want to fix the communication around this, and I don't even know where to start. We don't otherwise have major snags in communication.

I'm totally willing to accept that my desire to reject these things from my boyfriend makes me an asshole, by the way. I've just never dealt with something like this in a relationship.

It’s about my boyfriend M/27. Also, we’ve been dating for 2 years now.

My best friend’s wedding is going to be on the same day as my boyfriend’s birthday. My best friend was really excited when she sent me the invitation—she genuinely wants both of us to come. Yes, both of us. She’s inviting my boyfriend too since they were workmates for a few months.

The thing is, it’s also his birthday that day. Of course, I want him to be my date to the wedding—especially since it’ll be our first time attending a wedding together. I was really excited when I told him over the phone that he was invited, but I didn’t expect his reaction. He ended up sulking all day because it’s his birthday and it felt like he was making me choose between them. I assured him that we could celebrate his birthday in the morning—I even have a surprise planned. The wedding is in the late afternoon, so I thought we could do both. I never said I wasn’t going to celebrate his birthday. It’s just that I can’t control the fact that my best friend’s wedding and his birthday fall on the same day.

They both mean so much to me. But when I tried to explain that my best friend’s wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event—he got even more upset. I also reassured him that this doesn’t make his birthday any less special, but he’s still sulking about it. I don’t know what to do anymore.

1hc6wej,relationships,My bf hates his life because we don’t live in NYC and I can’t stand it,"Around 6 months ago, I (26F) moved to SF to be with my boyfriend (26M) . We had been long distance from norcal to socal for 2ish years. I quit my job, left my community, and moved in with him. I went full time with my small business. It’s worked out, but I miss my old job and have been interviewing to return to office in the bay. 

After like 1 month of living in SF with him, he started constantly talking about how SF is “dead” and NYC is the place to be. All his close friends live there and he actually had a lease when we met that he ended up breaking to date me. Then he went to NYC for a work trip and came back and talked about how much better NYC is EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. 

He goes downtown and talks about how dead it is in SF. Talks about how the social scene is so much better, how the people are way cooler, how his work life would be way better with the in person office culture in NYC. 

He talks about how “bored” he feels here in SF all the time and how he needs to move ASAP. I told him I’m open to moving, but the research positions I qualify for pay 2-3x times LESS than here in the bay.

The hard part is I think NYC would be an amazing experience, BUT I can’t justify 2-3x less pay. 

I just need to rant about this and get some advice for what I should do. I told him if he wants to move to NYC right now, he should just go, but he refuses and says not without me. I’m not down to continue to watch him be miserable. It sucks because we have a really amazing relationship right now. We both feel confident about each other being “the one” and potentially getting engaged soon. 

Should I try to make this dream happen for him or focus on myself?

Well, I didn't really expect to have an update this soon or at all. I suspect it'll be the only update.

After the first post I called her and told her I suspected she had feelings (I was right) and told her I didn't have feelings and wasn't ready for a relationship out of panic for the situation.

Thankfully it was therapy day. I talked things out with my therapist about how I have serious fears about getting back into a relationship, how those fears made me react way too quickly, and how now that things potentially collapsed I've re-examined how I feel about her. 

After therapy I just let myself sit with things for awhile. Then I called her. Call went to voicemail. So I texted her and let her know I wanted to talk and wanted to do it in person if she was willing. She texted back and said she was willing to meet for dinner to hear me out. So I laid everything out for her. How my last relationship fucked me up and how that made me panic when I realized she had feelings and act before I even gave myself time to process. And then I told her how I really felt. That her voice is my favorite sound, how her smile is what I see when I close my eyes, all of it, and most importantly that if she was willing to be patient with me I wanted to give us a shot. 

Anyways, I'm taking her in a proper date this weekend.

I honestly hated it. The quote was a religious quote that I found off putting and the overall look was not my style at all. I ended up hiding it in a closet and only hanging it up when I knew she was coming over. 

We eventually moved out of that house and when we did, the frame broke and I took the opportunity to dispose of it. 

Since then we’ve moved several more times and obviously I’ve never hung it in our newer houses since I don’t have it. 

Now MIL just asked husband where it was and said if we aren’t hanging it, she has someone else to give it to.

Husband just blamed it on all our moving and said he wasn’t sure where it ended up after the moves. I think he bought us a little time but how do we get out of this one. Ugh.

The whole thing is annoying me because first of all, it seems so rude to ask for a gift back. Second of all, she’s given us lots of things over the years and most of it I DO still have displayed. 

I try to keep a very pleasant but not very close relationship with her so this is so awkward. Help.

TLDR: MIL wants an ugly embroidery she gave us seven years ago back but I threw it out.

1l1g6s1,relationships,My (35F) parents (70s) moved into my one-bedroom apartment and it is destroying my mental health.,"I am a 35-year-old woman. I have had some successes in life. I have traveled a lot, I am pursuing a PhD, and I have worked across different sectors. But right now I am in a difficult place. I was laid off from my last full-time job and have been doing small contract gigs while applying for work and trying to finish my graduate program.
I have not had a real break since 2015 and I am extremely burnt out. I am also single and currently living in a one-bedroom apartment that my dad leases for tax residency purposes. My parents usually live abroad but they let me stay here while I get back on my feet.
In March 2025, both of my parents moved into the apartment with me. They are in their 70s and have serious medical needs. I told them this would be hard for me, especially while I am trying to finish my PhD and apply for jobs. They said it would be temporary, but they have now been here for months, but will leave at the end of June. The apartment is under 400 square feet. It is not meant for three adults, two of whom have a lot of belongings and ongoing care needs. My mom constantly complains about the mess but does not acknowledge the sheer impracticality of the situation. She blames me for the clutter and accuses me of being lazy, selfish, and emotionally unavailable. Meanwhile, I am working on multiple small jobs, trying to write, and going through interviews. It feels like nothing I do is ever enough.
My parents have always been critical, but in the past few years it has intensified. They constantly bring up milestones I have not met. I am single. I do not own property. I have been financially unstable since 2024. They compare me to people my age who are married, have homes, or make more money. The message is that I have failed in life and that it is my fault. Lately the criticism has turned more aggressive, especially about my relationship status. I once turned down a few arranged marriage style set ups and my mom cried and brought up her cancer diagnosis as a way to try push me into the process of it. She was baffled I didn’t even want to meet that guy and essentially said it’s the only way forward for me. I date in my own a lot but I have not found my person and they used this to push me new narratives of inadequacy. They suggest that my being single is proof that something is deeply wrong with me, like I’m some kind of failed eugenics project.

This week I finally tried to say something. I calmly told my parents that their moving in has made it very difficult for me to function and that I have been extremely unhappy. My mom exploded. After our argument, she got on the phone with my cousin and said the following in Bengali:
“I hope she does not get a husband, and even if she does, he will kick her out. She is sure to suffer in any relationship, even if there is love.” The phrasing in Bengali very clearly implied domestic violence. The way she said it, the ""kicking out"" was not figurative. She was saying I would deserve that kind of treatment. That even if someone loved me, I would make them hate me. That I was fundamentally defective, and something in me brings out the bad in otherwise good and loving people. 

Later, when I told her how hurtful this was, she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then she got angry again and accused me of being arrogant and ungrateful. She said I had ""grown too big for my britches"" and that she would ""cut me down."" She also ""joked"" about disinheriting me.

I feel like I am going crazy. I cannot trust anything. I am constantly being hurt, then told I imagined it or deserved it. My mother will go from saying terrifying things to suddenly acting normal and asking what I want for dinner. The switch is so fast that it makes me doubt my own memory and perception.

There is something else I need to mention. When I was about 11 or 12, I had a journal I kept private. My mom asked to see it. I refused. I remember standing my ground. She looked at me and said:
“I see how strong your no is. If you are ever taken advantage of, I will know on some level you consented.”
That memory has never left me. It was not a joke. It was not an offhand comment. I was a child setting a boundary, and she responded by threatening my sense of bodily autonomy and blaming me in advance for any potential future harm. I have spoken to my therapist about it and she suggested my mom might have Borderline Personality Disorder. But diagnosis aside, I feel lost. I do not know what to do anymore.

I feel guilty. My parents are aging and unwell. They have supported me financially at times, including giving me this place to stay. But their behavior is affecting my mental health so much that I am beginning to shut down. I feel like I will never build a life for myself if I stay stuck in this dynamic.

I am tired. I am ashamed. I feel worthless and angry and scared. I have no idea what to do next.

My questions:
What are some realistic steps I can take to set boundaries when I do not control the housing situation?
Am I overreacting or seeing this too emotionally? I honestly do not know anymore.
How do I protect myself emotionally while still trying to survive this phase of my life?

TL;DR: I am a 35-year-old woman trying to finish a PhD and job hunt after a layoff. My aging parents moved into my small one-bedroom apartment despite my objections. My mom is emotionally and verbally abusive, telling relatives I deserve mistreatment and blaming me for being single and unsuccessful. I feel like I am going crazy from the gaslighting, cruelty, and lack of space. I need help figuring out how to set boundaries and survive this dynamic.

1i7pvj3,relationships,"“I brought you food, but I ate it”","I came home from the park with our daughter, and My partner (28M) says “I brought you food but I ate it, I thought I was full but I wasn’t” I said oh okay (to avoid the constant conflict) and I asked if it was good. He said it was really good. I went on to use the very little groceries around the house to make food for our daughter and I. 

What im trying to say is, I’m really the one who feeds our daughter. I’ve literally seen him feed himself before our daughter when she’s obviously hungry. 

The few times he’s cooked dinner for “us” he’ll only make one plate and says he like “sharing with me” but hogs the plate and eats most of it. He rarely provides groceries for us, and when he does he’s kind of mean about it… I’m a stay at home mom with no income. I’ll have to fight for the smallest things but he’ll get nice things for himself  (fancy cheeses, drinks, coffees) and have it right in front of us. 

Of course I’m always making sure our daughter is more than fed, I bake sourdough treats and fun foods with what I have (she’s still full time breastfeeding too) I always have her eat before me or with me. 

But I, (26F, 120lbs) also enjoy eating. Especially when I was pregnant and postpartum, then and still full time breastfeeding. I guess as long as baby is fed then I’m more than okay. But it’s hard on my body when I feel like I don’t eat enough, I eat normally when he’s not around, but when he is, it’s challenging. 

I’ve never had an eating disorder, and I’m pretty fit, healthy, and low weight. (Not that I should even have to say that) I’m just wondering why it’s like this..

Is this is wrong, weird, uncomfortable, or hurtful or am I just honestly overreacting.

1kpejxp,relationships,My boyfriend sleeps at 8am every night and it’s making me go insane.,"It’s exactly like the title. I am (F17) and he is (M20) We have been together for a year now and he has always had this problem, I’ve told him that he should to fix it and that I’d help him with it, but he doesn’t do anything to improve it.

This whole year he has given me empty promises about fixing it and I’ve really gotten tired of those “promises”. (he is basically gaming all night for those who wants to know)

He wakes up at around 18 or 19 in the night (6pm and 7pm) or maybe even later. I want to spend time with him but he’s not willing to fix his sleep to do that.

Every time I bring the subject up with him, he gets very upset and says bad things to himself, and says that he just always forgets the time when he’s playing.

When he wakes up, he’s very moody and can get angry easily throughout the days.

There are times where I made him go to sleep “early”with me (probably at 3am) and woke up early aswell, where he told me that he actually felt a lot better doing that, so I just simply don’t understand why he keeps going to bed so late.

I have suggested to him MULTIPLE times that he should set an alarm for when he’s supposed to sleep and he says it’s a good idea, so I tell him to set the alarm like right now so he doesn’t forget and he just dismisses it because he doesn’t feel like doing it.

I really need some advice because I want to spend my time with my boyfriend, and this has only gotten so much worse throughout the year. I love him so much and I just want the best for him.

He goes to bed super late and wakes up at around 18 or later and I really miss the quality time with him.

I on the other hand am applying to school right now (taking my MCAT Friday) and serving job that I mostly work from 7-4 Saturday, Sunday, and Monday so our schedules are definitely different.

Usually when I go to work, I let him sleep obviously it being so early. For him though, he does NOT like when I sleep in when he has to go to work. We got in a big fight because he was starting to get ready for work at 8:30, woke me up and told me he wanted me to “get up and send him off to work”, “you already slept” and not be “a lazy piece of shit” and “that when or if we have children am I just going to sleep through life and make him do everything”

I just feel like this is a bit extreme and jealousy. In my mind it sucks because I’m not really thinking anything of it when I work. I get up, I try to not wake him up, and kiss him goodbye. I just don’t understand why I’m the one that has to get up and be chipper and do whatever else he wants me to do when it’s technically my weekend. I want us to be able to move past this fight as it seems not that big of a deal, to me at least. How do I go about discussing this with him in a way I can show him my side and how this also affects me? 

TL;DR My boyfriend gets upset/angry when I am sleeping and don’t wake up and “send him off” when he has to go to work at 8:30. I work on weekends and applying to med school this cycle. How do I talk to him about how I don’t agree?

I've (28F) been dating this guy (36M) since October 2023 and we've been really happy. I had fallen for him.

I got the shock of my life today when I received a phone call from his long term girlfriend of 9 years. I didn't believe her at first, I thought she had the wrong guy until she sent me a picture of them together.

She said that they have a baby together who is a couple months old. A planned baby. They were thinking of moving in together during COVID lockdown but decided to live separately.

I can't believe this. I am utterly stunned. The amount of time we spent together and he had a girlfriend? I'm so confused. I was frequently with him, at his place, going out for example for food or at my place.

It hasn't sunken in yet that this is real life. He was the kindest guy I had ever met, and it was all a lie? He treated me like a princess in the whole one+ year we've been together.

My mind is doing somersaults because I still haven't processed that this is real. How did he find the time? When did he even see her? When? Why? How? What?

I had fallen in love with him and wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. I do not even recognize him. There were no signs whatsoever. I've cried all day. I'm not sure I could ever trust anyone again. How do I recover from this?

1mjsk9v,relationships,"24F married off without consent, don’t want to stay in it, how do I talk to my parents about divorce?","Hi everyone,

I’m a 24-year-old woman from California. When I was 23, my parents arranged a marriage for me without telling me to a man (27M) in India. We’ve now been married for about a year.

Growing up in the U.S., I always believed I’d choose who I marry someone I liked, felt emotionally connected to, and saw a future with. So it was incredibly disorienting when my parents decided everything for me behind my back.

When I told my friends, most of them said, “Maybe try to make it work.” So I did. I genuinely tried. But a year in, I don’t feel anything for him, and I honestly don’t think I ever will. I’ve put in the effort, but nothing has changed. I’m not happy.

Meanwhile, I see my friends dating people they actually like and choosing their relationships, and while I’m happy for them, it’s also painful. I want that too. But instead, I feel stuck with someone I didn’t choose and don’t feel connected to.

I’ve talked about this with my therapist. She told me: “It sounds like you know this relationship isn’t right for you. You’ve tried. It’s okay to talk to your parents about divorce.” And I agree with her. I know I don’t want to stay in this.

The problem is… I have no idea how to bring it up again. I tried mentioning it to my mom months ago, and it blew up into a huge fight. If you’re familiar with Indian culture, you know how taboo divorce is especially for daughters. The fear of being disowned is real for me.

I’m looking for advice from anyone who has dealt with something similar or who has tips on how to approach strict/traditional parents about something like this without it turning into a disaster. I’m scared, but I also know I can’t live like this forever.

TL;DR:
I’m a 24F from California. My parents secretly arranged a marriage for me to a man (27M) in India when I was 23. I’ve tried to make it work, but I’m not happy and don’t want to stay in the marriage. Divorce is extremely taboo in my culture, and I’m afraid of how my parents will react.

The issue is, he gets mad at any noise while he’s working...not just loud stuff, but even normal day-to-day noises. If I’m making lunch, opening a cabinet, walking through, whatever… he says it’s “distracting” or “rude.”

The result is that on my weekday off or the days I work remotely, I basically end up quarantined to the bedroom and bathroom all day just so I don’t upset him. Meanwhile, when I’m in a meeting (I take mine in the bedroom with the door closed), he feels free to come in and do stuff around me, even when I politely ask him not to because it’s distracting and a confidentiality issue.

I’m starting to feel like there’s a double standard here: I have to tiptoe around the whole house when he’s working, but he doesn’t respect my space when I’m working. It honestly feels suffocating and unfair.

How do I even begin to talk to him about this? I want to respect his work, but I also need to be able to live in my own home without feeling like a prisoner.

1n8dk9u,relationships,"My brother has convinced my mom that I, an openly gay man, am trying to steal his wife. What do I do?","Looking for any kind of advice on what I can do or if I should just completely cut my losses with my shitshow of a family.

My brother (32m) has successfully convinced my family that I (24m) am in love with my SiL (24f) and am trying to manipulate her against him so I can steal her away. My Brother and SiL have been married for 4 years.

This apparently all came about because a couple months ago her and my sister (34f) had a big blowup about my SiL’s pregnancy and I defended my SiL against my sister’s big tirade. Following that night I received a lot of scrutiny from family, particularly my brother for “interfering in woman’s business” and I said some not so nice things to him. My SiL also reached out to me and apologized to me for “causing the situation” and I let her know she had nothing to apologize for and that I’m here to help both her and my nephew.

We ended up having a pretty in depth conversation about how my sister has treated her in the past. Apparently, my sister moved in with her and my brother for a brief period to help with my SiL’s first pregnancy and was really overbearing and constantly ridiculing her choices for “the sake of the baby”. My SiL unfortunately suffered from what sounded like an ectopic pregnancy and had to have an emergency surgery to have the fetus removed, my sister AND my brother apparently think that’s the same thing as aborting a baby and she was blamed for the loss of the child and from how she spoke she also saw this as a failure on her part.

It pissed me off and I did my best to explain to her the medical reasonings of why what happened was necessary and not her fault and that my brother and sister are just kind of stupid, she shouldn’t feel bad for doing something necessary to save her life, especially because the fetus wasn’t even viable. That was the last time she spoke and I just let her know I’d be there if she needed anything.

I guess either she told my brother or he found out from her messages about the conversation and took it as me flirting with his wife?? I’ll give him the fact that I did call him stupid in the messages but cmon, thinking an emergency procedure for a life threatening situation was your wife willfully terminating her pregnancy and making her feel bad about it is fucking stupid sorry. 

He told the rest of my family about how I’m envious and trying to take his wife which they all believed and are now mad at me. This wouldn’t be a big deal to me if my mom(53f) wasn’t also included in that. My mom is the only one in my family I have good relationship with but apparently she believes my brother and has called me to scold me about betraying my brother and being shameless along with my other family members.

This is all frustrating but here’s the absolute best part about this: The reason I’m estranged from my family is because I’m gay, it is like THE thing that fucked our family up. I’ve very openly been seeing another man for the past 3 years. My brother has also been open about not wanting me around his family because of my “unnatural lifestyle”. All that just to easily believe I’m in love with a woman??? 

I guess the reason I come here is so that I can understand how this would be believable? I understand my dad and my sister believing this easily, they hate me and probably just want a reason to feel justified in rallying against me, but I can’t really comprehend my mother believing it but maybe I gave her too much credit, at the end of the day, I am very much the outlier of my family on all fronts. I also wonder if maybe my SiL took what I was saying as me taking an interest in her? Maybe I made her uncomfortable but the most I did was just explain medical things to her so she wouldn’t feel bad about her first pregnancy.

I don’t know, I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, I’ve always been at peace with not having my family, especially because my family is full of nutjobs but I think potentially having to accept my mom is also that way is making me second guess myself. I also don’t like the idea that I made my SiL uncomfortable. 

Sorry for the long post but has anyone been in a situation similar to this? Is my relationship with my mom salvageable and can I get her to see that my brother is a mental case?

All the advice in my [now 49 dear god] previous post was reasonable, good advice; I’m glad I didn’t take any of it. I’m still married, and I love my life and my wife [now 49]. Like any marriage, there are things we work on, but in retrospect the incident with the guy whose name I just realized I don’t even remember (I’ll call that progress!) was truly a Bipolar II hypomanic phase, at a time that the medication she was on for depression only exacerbated the issue. Every year in May, on the anniversary of me finding out and her suicide attempt, for the first few years, were very hard. It’s gotten better every year, this year I didn’t even notice til today and it’s over a week past.

We vacation together, we’re intimate several times per month, we have plans for when our kids are out of the house for a popup trailer and travel.

I learned though the process of couples therapy how important it is for me to be ok with just me; if I’m alone or end up divorced I will survive and retain my identity. I have my hobbies and have established my self worth. She has continued to work on her mental health, with professionals, and has succeeded in avoiding the worst ups and downs. I love her, she loves me, and we’re still gratefully together.

All this to say, divorce and separation may be the right answer to a lot of situations — I don’t take for granted that it isn’t in my future — but you should know it’s not the only solution for really bad situations. You may be able to work though it and be happy.

tldr: my wife and I are still together, and happy, and I’m glad I didn’t take the fairly consistent advice from my post 10 years ago.

1hql5ty,relationships,"My fiancé gave me a chocolate bar for Christmas, and I’m struggling with how to feel about it.","Hi everyone, I’m (30F), and I’ve been with my fiancé (39M) for two years. We moved in together in February of this year, and while our relationship has had good moments, it’s also been a really tough year.

For context, we went through something devastating this year: I was five months pregnant and went into early labor, and we lost our son. It’s been a heartbreaking experience, and we’ve both been struggling to navigate life and our relationship since then.

One ongoing issue we’ve always had is how we handle special occasions. I love celebrating birthdays, holidays, and other milestones, and I always put effort into making them special. My fiancé, on the other hand, doesn’t care about these things and doesn’t believe they’re important.

For Christmas this year, we discussed gifts in November. I have two daughters from a previous relationship, and he has three children from his. I asked my girls what they wanted and got their gifts, and for him, I knew he wanted a watch but couldn’t find one he’d like. Instead, I bought him a Manchester United jersey with “Director” on it, as he recently got a promotion and became a director at his company. I thought it was a thoughtful way to acknowledge his achievement.

On Christmas Eve, at midnight, he handed me my gift: a chocolate bar. For context, it wasn’t even a type of chocolate I like—it was his favorite. I prefer dark chocolate with unique flavors, while this was plain milk chocolate from a brand I rarely eat. I thanked him at the moment but felt really disappointed.

The next day, I brought it up. I explained that the gift felt like an afterthought and that I was hurt he didn’t even try to pick something meaningful. I value thoughtful gestures, even if they’re small. It’s not about the money; it’s about feeling seen and appreciated. He called me selfish and ungrateful for saying anything.

Now I’m questioning if I’m expecting too much or if this is a sign of a deeper issue in our relationship. I’ve been feeling like he’s emotionally checked out for a while now, and this situation has only amplified that feeling.

I don’t know how to move forward. Am I overreacting about the gift? Is this something we can work through, or does it point to bigger problems? I’d really appreciate any advice or perspective.

1jipv81,relationships,"**I’ve gone silent in my marriage to protect myself, but I’m breaking inside. Do I speak up or keep detaching until I disappear?**","Hi Reddit,  
I (F33) am emotionally exhausted and don’t know what to do anymore. My husband (M35) and I have been together for a long time. He’s always been emotionally distant, but it’s gotten worse—so cold that now I feel like a ghost living in his home. Whenever I try to express hurt, he shuts down or gets angry. I’ve learned that if I speak up, I lose whatever little peace or connection we have, so I’ve started swallowing my pain just to survive.

Some recent incidents broke something in me:

He went on a trip while I was in serious pain from a PCOS flare-up. I went to the doctor alone and was told my cyst was large and painful. The doctor suggested surgery if it worsens, which scared me. While on a call with him, I was explaining the diagnosis when he cut me off mid-sentence and said, “Okay, I’ll talk later.” I told him this wasn’t okay—but after that, he never called me the whole week. Just sent occasional “How are you?” texts that felt like a formality. I found out more about his trip from his Instagram stories than from him directly.

When he returned and I asked why he didn’t call, he said, “You were already angry. No point ruining my vacation.” I told him that deeply hurt me, and he exploded—called me mentally unstable and said:  
“I have no emotions for you. Don’t expect anything. If this relationship dies, so be it. I won’t put any effort into it. You don’t deserve to be spoken to normally. Your demands never stop. I can’t do this anymore.”

In a panic, I apologized and promised I wouldn’t trouble him again.

Later, we were supposed to go on a trip with friends, but I caught the flu. He went alone—which is fine—but didn’t call me once in five days. Didn’t ask if I was at my parents’ or home. Just one “how are you” text per day because friends asked about me. No real concern.

I’ve been handling everything at home—errands, chores, my health—alone. I haven’t demanded anything, just wanted basic emotional presence. But even that seems like too much to ask.

I often wonder—am I overthinking? Am I victimizing myself? Should I just stay cheerful around him like he prefers? Every time I’ve brought up an issue, he’s gotten angry. And out of fear that he’ll leave—or worse, because of days-long silent treatment—I’ve broken down, apologized, and promised to never bring things up again, just for the normalcy to return.

So I’ve started emotionally detaching. I don’t tell him about my day, my plans, or house matters. I mirror his energy. And oddly, he seems more comfortable now. He hasn’t noticed the shift. Hasn’t asked. Even when his family asked why I seemed distant, he said, “Nothing’s wrong. I haven’t done anything.”

That shattered me. After everything, he still believes he’s done nothing wrong.

I thought I could stay this way—quietly detached and still in the marriage. But some days—like today—it just hurts too much. I feel like I can’t do this anymore. I’m scared, I feel gutted and tense. I want to know where I stand—because each day I stay distant, it feels like he enjoys the silence while I die quietly inside.

I don’t want a fight. I just want clarity. How do I bring this up without him getting angry or dismissing me again? Or should I just keep pretending, keep fading?

**TL;DR:**  
My husband is emotionally distant and gets angry when I bring up hurt or ask for support. After years of trying, I’ve gone quiet to protect myself. He doesn’t notice or ask why. I feel like I’m slowly disappearing. I want to know where I stand, but I’m scared if I speak up, he’ll explode again. Should I speak up one last time or keep detaching until I can leave?


**Update: I Told Him the Truth—His Response? Silence.**  

Yesterday, he sat next to me and asked about my PCOS. I said I was doing okay, and then he asked why I was being so distant. That’s when I told him everything—the whole truth.  

I told him how dismissing my pain while he was traveling, no calls to check on me , calling me *mentally unstable*, and outright saying he *doesn’t want to put in effort* were not ""small things."" His response? *""Why do you make such small issues into a big deal?""*  

I told him straight up: *This is a dealbreaker for me. If this is the end of our relationship, so be it, but I will not put up with this disrespect.* I made it clear that being left alone to handle everything, with zero concern from him, showed exactly how much he cared. I also told him I don’t *need* him—I’ve already been doing everything alone.  

His defense? *""I don’t travel much, and the one time I didn’t check in, you made such a big deal out of it.""* One time? He’s been traveling constantly since January, and every single time, he’s been emotionally absent. But even if it *was* just one time—why is ignoring your spouse when she’s suffering something to be brushed off?  

And then? *Nothing.* No argument, no concern, no attempt to have a conversation—just complete quiet. And that’s scarier than if he had lashed out. Because I know this pattern. It’s not him actually processing anything or feeling bad. It’s *avoidance*. It’s waiting for me to either break the silence or feel guilty for making things ""worse.""  

I know exactly what’s happening. He’s waiting for *me* to be the one to take the final step so he can play the victim—the *poor guy whose wife left him*. He will never take responsibility or even acknowledge what he did was wrong. And that silence? It’s not guilt. *It’s control.*  

I spoke to his sister after this conversation. She thinks my mother-in-law should know, but I’m hesitant. If I tell her, she’ll likely confront him, and he’ll turn his anger on me—accusing me of ruining his reputation.  

And I know a lot of you have been asking: *Why haven’t I left yet?*  

It’s not as easy as it sounds. It’s years of being together, years of me *shrinking* every time he gets angry so he doesn’t leave. I do know what’s happening. I do know leaving is inevitable. But I *haven’t built the guts to take that step yet*.  

I know it’s trauma bonding. I know this relationship is harming me. But it’s that *final step* that terrifies me—because deep down, I’m scared of being alone. And even worse? I’m scared of how easily he will move on, as if I never meant anything.",670,0.87,670,0,788.0,118.0,127,1742820570.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jipv81/ive_gone_silent_in_my_marriage_to_protect_myself/,False,True

TL;DR: I (Female 20) and my Bf (Male 20) have been dating for just about 2 years. To cut to the chase he is into feederism and bloating and i am not.

(REPOST: This got deleted for some reason) 

I am a smaller girl (i wear a size 4) and when he told me about this i said i am uncomfortable as it bleeds into daily life. If i am full from dinner and i say “im full or im bloated” he takes that sexually. I feel very uncomfortable by this, i dont like becoming sexualized just by eating or feeling the uncomfortable feeling of being bloated.

We tried to “water bloat” and i hated it. I feel disgusting and uncomfortable yet he tries to push it on me at least once a month. I also feel like he wants me to get larger and I do not.

When i say no he gets sad and says im not fulfilling his needs. Am i not enough?

to add context, he has been addicted to porn and this also bleeds into our relationship.

I really do care about him but i don’t know how to tell him that i feel sexually coerced. but i also personally don’t think this is a means of breakup.

1hn8qln,relationships,My Fiancé (31M) met a woman and has been texting her in ways that makes me uncomfortable… ,"I’m so embarrassed typing this but here we go. I am a 28F, my Fiance is 31M. We’ve been together for 8 years. 

He is an alcoholic and recently he went to a facility to detox and treatment. When he called me after being in there for a few weeks he told me that he was in a unisex wing so he’s been meeting new “friends” who are men and women. 

Fast forward to about a week later when he gets out. He told me about the guys that he’s met and the women that he’s met… one being a “40 something year old woman named Angela who has kids” (name changed for safety reasons). He says he likes her because she’s like a mother figure. While he’s at home he’s on his phone texting more and taking pictures of himself around the house. I ignore it but I’m suspicious of it. A week later, he says he’s meeting up with Angela at the mall to just talk about their recovery plans. Okay sure, I love that he’s making friends. He goes out for about 2 hours.

A week after that, it’s a few days before Christmas. He tells me that he’s invited to a family Christmas party. Same day, he starts drinking and relapses. I check his phone to get the address of the holiday party because I miss his family and would love to see them. I open the text app and it’s already in a chat with Angela. Now my curiosity kicks in, I scroll through the messages and see his saying things like “do you dream of me”, “I freaking miss you”, “you don’t know how much I care for you”, “I’m happy for the first time in a long time and you’ve been helping with that”. I find her Instagram and it has her first and last name, I do a quick Google and find out that she’s actually 35. 

The same day he relapses, I take him to the hospital because he drank too much. I don’t bring up the texts. But when I head home for the night after being in the hospital for a few hours with him he wants me to take his things like wallet and clothes but to leave his phone there. I get home with his wallet and clothes then go into his wallet to grab a photo of us that he keeps in there, it’s one of my favorite pictures of us. He has a thin wallet that doesn’t have a lot of pockets or any zippers, just a flat wallet. Inside of the cash pocket there is our picture but there are also condoms and 2 love letters (more like poems) that Angela wrote him while they were in that facility. 

I feel like shit. I’ve stood by this man for years while his addiction ruins so much. I’ve lost weight, cried, gone in and out of depression, lost money, lost friends, missed opportunities, lost jobs, lost vehicles, lost my personality… for this man. I’m not trying to jump the gun which is why I stopped “snooping”. I saw that I needed to see after 3 minutes of looking through the texts. And I wish I didn’t see those love letters and condoms in his wallet. I don’t want to believe that he would cheat with me after spending maybe a week in a facility with this girl…. But thinking back to how he was talking and replaying some conversations i am also seeing hints. 

TL;DR
- alcoholic fiance meets a woman while in a facility 
- he’s been texting her, calling her, and met up with her
- I find out he lied about her age
- I found condoms and 2 love letters in his wallet where he keeps my favorite picture of us

UPDATE: He doesn’t have access to his phone because he’s at rehab.. but I sent a 2 paragraph text to his phone that he will see when he gets out. It will answer his question as to why I’m not picking him up and why it will be one of his family members instead. And yeah, I’m very pissed. I’m very upset. And I’m very very angry. But I’m working on moving on. Pls keep the comments kind, I beat myself up daily already because I’ve stayed in this situation for so long. I’d much rather hear your stories of how you moved on.

1kniyv3,relationships,"BF (25 M) said I ruined his birthday, I tried. What do I do?","Yesterday was my (25F) bfs (26M) birthday. We’ve been dating nearly 4 years now. I put in good effort for the occasion- I got him three gifts that totaled about $325 and all correlated to his most current hobbies (a cool monster hunter figure imported from japan, merch from his favorite sports team, a glass guitar slide). I baked a cake from scratch, probably the best thing I’ve ever made ngl. I made dinner reservations at a nice place. I just wanted to do it right and make him feel special.

He loved the gifts, and we spent the morning having coffee and cake. He told me later he liked the cake so much that it was literally all he ate that day before dinner. We both had work that day, and I had a pretty busy day. I admit I was a little stressed when I got home, but I was excited for dinner and we both got ready and headed out.

I feel like dinner was where I messed up. It started out fine, and our meals were delicious and we were chatting abt random stuff. But at some point I just kept saying the wrong thing, ig. We were talking about tattoos we wanted, and I accidentally brought up an old incident where he left a family reunion with his siblings to get tats, which ended up taking 8 hours and left me babysitting a bunch of random children alone. He seemed upset, I realized my mistake, and I quickly changed topics. But he clearly was still upset. As soon as we left he wouldn’t talk to me in the car or at home, and all he wanted to do was lay in bed silently scrolling his phone. He didn’t want to be touched either.

The next morning he said he was miserable for the entirety of his birthday. That kinda hurt. He seemed happy the previous morning and we had a great convo over coffee. He told me he had an awful day at work, and my irritability when I got home was not okay (I made two comments about food in the sink and the cat peeing on the floor, but I guess I didn’t balance it out with something positive). He said he wasn’t happy with our dinner conversation, and all he wanted on his birthday was to be happy, so I ruined it.

I know I could have done better, but I find it difficult to be the perfect conversationalist. I’m so much better at the gestures, so it always sucks when saying dumb shit ruins it. Most of the birthday posts I’ve seen are the opposite- no effort, forgot, etc. 

What could I have done differently in this situation? How do I make it up to my bf? 

Any advice greatly appreciated

1j3jztq,relationships,"After over 10 years together, I (F30s) am questioning my relationship with my autistic partner (M30s) due to the symptoms of his neurodivergencies","My partner and I have been together since 2014. We have had our ups and downs but have mostly worked through the downs. A lot of the downs have been caused by miscommunication and issues stemming from his being neurodivergent (Autism and ADHD) and myself being neurotypical. 



I've worked a lot on trying to learn about how his brain works, and to be accommodating. I've let go of wants and desires I have had that aren't compatible with his brain. And he tries so hard to be a good partner. 



But something happened recently that has me in a tail spin and is making me question if I am cut out to be in this relationship any longer. 



I adopted a dog 2 years before my partner and I got together. At his last senior health check up we got bad news. The blood work indicates that he has cancer and we'll probably be losing him sometime in the next few months. :( 



A few days ago I was really emotional and grieving the impending loss of my pupper. I couldn't hold back tears and I went to my partner for support. I just wanted to tell someone how scared and sad I was about losing my dog. I wanted a hug. Something. I don't even know. I was unraveling and I was vulnerable. 



But while I was pouring my heart out to my partner, he picked up his phone and started googling ""how to make neighbor's dog stop barking"" and completely tuned me out. You see, he was having sensory issues. The neighbor's dog was yapping, he was cold and his shirt didn't feel right. It was all driving him towards a meltdown.



When I realized what was happening, I steeled up. I pushed my emotions down and I helped my partner find his noise canceling headphones and a warmer, softer shirt. Once he was back to base line, he apologized to me for not listening when I had tried to talk to him earlier. 



But something in me just fucking \*broke\*. I don't think I ever felt so alone as I did that day. It's like I instantaneously fell out of love with him. 10 years together and it all just dissolved for me in a less than 10 minute interaction. 



And I know it's not his fault. It's not like he did it on purpose or anything. He hates that this is the way his brain works. 



But I can't help but think ""Dogs are always going to be yapping in the background. Winter is always going to be cold. We're getting older, what's going to happen when we start losing human family members? What happens if I am the one to get a terminal illness diagnosis someday? Is he capable of being there for me?""



And now I'm not sure what to do. I am looking for advice from people who have been in similar situations or to be pointed into the direction to find resources for this kind of ND/NT issue. Or fuck it. Even just permission to end things I guess. I don't really know. I just feel terrible about all of it. 



TL;DR - Partner was unable to support me emotionally due to his ND sensory issues and now I am wondering if I can go through life with someone I can't rely on.

1kc0c2x,relationships,I (34f) cannot match my husband’s (36m) level of affection after having a baby. Husband is not happy about it.,"I (34f) cannot match my husband’s (36m) level of affection and it’s bothering him.

My husband and I love each other very much but he has always been way more affectionate than me. (We’ve been together 8 years and married 5) He is very touchy, he loves to kiss, etc. However our different level of affectionate was minimal enough that it hasn’t bothered him. That’s until we had a baby 9 months ago. 

Tonight he came to me and said someone hit on him at the gym, and he felt really weird about it, and said he wants us to be more affectionate with each other. I got hung up on him feeling weird about getting hit on, because to me, that implies he was tempted. Otherwise, why would he feel weird about it?? He said he felt weird because he’s never been hit on before and it reminded him of how much he only wants to be with me, which doesn’t really make sense to me. But that’s what he says so ok. 

Then he said stuff like how we haven’t touched in over a month (which is NOT true, and he later admitted that it was not true). And that after our baby goes to bed, there’s so much time to be affectionate with each other, but I don’t seem interested in that at all. I see his point and I understand where he is coming from, but after I put our baby to bed, all I want to do is just relax and have some fun (watch TV, browse on my phone, play game, etc). At that point, I’ve been affectionate with our baby all day long, I don’t have any more room for affection. I know there’s maternal affection and romantic affection, but at the end of the day, I just don’t have much room left for any sort of affection. I explained this to my husband and he said he understands, but he just wanted to voice out how he feels. 

To me, it feels like we are heading towards a slippery slope where he doesn’t feel loved enough by me and the only solution is going to be me trying to show more affection to him by going out of my way, which is going to eat away at my happiness. 

I love my husband. I love him more after becoming parents. Seeing him grow into his father role has deepened my love for him, and it sucks he needs physical affection to validate all that. 

I think at the core, there’s a key difference in what we expect from each other at this point in our life/relationship. I need him to be a good father, but he needs me to be an affectionate wife and a mother. What can I do to show more affection without it feeling like a task? And am I valid in feeling like my husband is only caring about what he needs and not what I need? I understand he needs more affection, but I also need a break from affection at the end of the day. How do we find a middle ground in this? I don’t want our marriage to suffer. 

Tldr: we are new parents. Husband needs more affection from me, but I have no more room for affection. What is the solution here? ",607,0.86,607,0,725.0,118.0,99,1746073943.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kc0c2x/i_34f_cannot_match_my_husbands_36m_level_of/,False,True
1hi24l1,relationships,"Lines been crossed, do I (31f) kick my bf (29m) and father of my 3 children out right before Christmas?","I (31f) have been with my boyfriend (29m) for 10 years. We have 3 children together, live together, dogs, the whole thing. He's a good person, we usually enjoy each other's company and hang out together and laugh, etc. Many times our disagreements stem from being stressed from both of us working, bills, 3 small kids, not usually because 1 of us did something to cross the other.

In the beginning of our relationship he cheated on me (denies it) but for sure did with this girl. We were younger at that point no kids and a bit off and on. I took him back, and swore to him and myself that if I ever found out he talked to her again I'd leave. We'll fast forward 6 years and I see he has her added as a friend on fb. This had to be recent like within the last few days. Noticed because he said to go look at this dudes page (a client of his) and both their names start with the same letter so as I typed it she popped up.

We've been going thru a rough patch, we're struggling financially, don't have much support with the kids. Just both stressed and snappy. He is not a talker, I try to communicate and he shuts down. Literal silent treatment and if he comes around I feel like I'm his mother lecturing him and he will usually just say ""ok"" ""yeah"", maybe nods his head in agreement. Long story short recently I've  tried to explain that I too am stressed and work full time and need the same amout of ""me time"" as he gets--he often hangs out with his friends after work or stays for a few beers and i have to call and ask him to come home. But instead of listening/trying to understand its just silence, maybe a day or 2 of being nicer than usual and then back to normal like nothing happened.

So now that I've seen he has this girl added as a friend on fb I texted him to say what the actual fuck. Silence. He doesn't take me seriously clearly. I don't want to break up our family, our kids adore him, but I can't live in silence. And asking him again to block this girl makes me feel like a fool. For all I know they've been messaging back and forth saying God knows what. I feel like the only way he'll take me serious is if I keep promise and end things. I will be heartbroken and my kids will too but this feels like a line crossed that can't be reversed. I wish he'd just get his shit together. 

Tl;dr: BF and father of my kids cheated on me years ago. Added the girl on fb again 6 years later, I told him that would be my final straw if he ever talked to her again. Not sure if I should kick him out. 





Update: So after I texted him asking about the girl he added I did not hear anything from him. Complete silence. He stayed out until 5 am and came home drunk. I found an opened condom wrapper in the car. Told him to get his shit and go and he's gone. Escalated very quickly I absolutely did not think that was going to happen.

1l2rb3q,relationships,How do I (f28) gently tell my wife (f30) that I don’t care to hear about her hobby all the time?,"Hi y’all, my wife has an incredibly stressful job and has found it very therapeutic to do creative writing. I love that she has a hobby that she loves and can create something, but it’s become very obsessive. The creative writing is fanfiction for an anime, one that I’ve seen some of but it’s not my style and it’s incredibly overhyped now so I don’t care to finish it. 

The hobby started very small, her just writing for a few hours a month. But recently she’s gotten really motivated to rework a fic that she already completed, and branch out and write a whole universe for it. I adore seeing her passionate about something, but it’s taken over a bit. 

She spends hours at her desk on days off writing, brings a notebook to her work so she can write on her free time, and thinks about it on her way home so when she gets home she immediately has to write down her ideas. She works Monday-Friday, and our weekends were always us going on a date and spending time together since it’s the only time we really get one on one time. But the past 4 weekends she doesn’t want to leave the house because she’s writing, and when I brought it up that I want us to do something, she just kind of brought the mood down while we were out since she clearly didn’t want to do anything but be at home writing. 

I adore her so much, and she’s an amazing partner but she won’t stop talking about her writing. She will ask me to read something or how she can work a scene better, or even questions about the characters since I’ve seen some of the show. And I feel so rude because she’s really passionate about it and is excited about writing, but it’s so much and it’s all she wants to talk about. She came home today and I tried to have a discussion about her grandparents being in town next weekend and how we should prepare (first time for me meeting them, so I’m nervous about it) and she kind of brushed it off and just switched the topic to her writing. 

How do I nicely tell her I don’t care sometimes? I’m worried if I tell her she’s gonna be upset and not talk to me at all about it, which I don’t want her to feel like she can’t be open about her passions with me. 

TL;DR- my wife is obsessive about her writing, and it makes me irritated when she won’t stop talking about it. 




📢 EDIT/UPDATE!- 
Thank you all so much for commenting, it’s been really nice to talk to other people about this, and get insight into others with adhd. 

Not sure if anyone will find this update- Sunday we had a talk about things. This past week has been incredibly intense for both of us work wise, and the disconnect I’ve been feeling got the better of me and I shut down completely. I didn’t realize how much it hurt to felt unseen and rejected in a sense, in my own relationship. 

It all came to an end when I, very stupidly, slept on the couch Saturday night since I felt so distant from her that it triggered my flight response. Sunday morning I woke up to her sleeping on the couch with me, and then we both talked and cried about everything. 

I confessed how I was feeling unseen, and that we haven’t had any time one on one lately, and our disconnect was really hard for me. She confessed to noticing the disconnect but wasn’t sure if she was reading into things. I told her that I felt like I was competing for her attention with her writing, and I needed more time with just us. She agreed and apologized for letting the writing take over so much. 

This past week has been very triggering for her since her job required her to deal with a sexual assault case. She said she just wanted to be out of her head and distracted as much as possible, and writing did that. I understand, but since I didn’t know that was happening, I asked her to communicate that to me next time. And I think I subconsciously picked up on her shutting down, so I picked on her writing because I didn’t know what was happening. 

But we’ve grown closer and have set boundaries. We set up one and one time every weekend, doing something fun/unplugged and just us, and we now have astronaut time. Which is when we both have our headsets/headphones in and can be in our heads and not feel the need to interact. It was such a good feeling afterwards, to just be so open with each other. I know I have a hard time communicating my feelings a lot, but I am working on it. 

Thanks for reading, and again thank you for commenting so I can understand how her brain works!

I (23F) have been married to my husband (27M) for a little over two years, together for 5 overall. When we got married, he knew I was bisexual and had shared my past experience (only 1) with a girl. For reference, it didn’t go past the kissing stage, and our time together was veryyy brief (about 2/3 weeks). I shared this part of me to my husband BEFORE we got married, and knew it was something that made him uncomfortable but he still accepted me and loved me for who I was. Or so I thought. Over time, he has randomly brought it up in random situations, which I never found “bad” in a way since I was just like ok whatever he is just being annoying, but since we would never fight or argue about it, I didn’t see it as a problem when he did bring it up. I have had one serious conversation with him about this topic with him and let him know that I love him and that i chose to marry HIM. that I would never cheat on him, and if i ever did, it would probably be with a guy, not a girl. I also made it clear to him that if he could not accept me for who I am, we should not be together. I accept him for all his faults and defects (even though being anything but heterosexual isn’t a fault or defect) and God knows he isn’t perfect. I’ve forgiven him for looking at other girls a few times on his cellphone, and watching 🌽 when we had already said we wouldn’t do that in our relationship. I know the two situations aren’t comparable, but I brought it for the sake of argument. 

Anyways, here’s the issue. Last night, we were having dinner while watching Friends on tv, and mind you, ever since we started watching that show together (he’s never seen it) he makes little comments out him turning out like Ross (who plays a divorced character becaUse his wife left him for a woman). I always ignore it or tell him to stop, but since he says it in such a lighthearted way, I never felt the need to argue or say much, as whenever this does happen, I usually will be like “babe stop, i love U” and that’s usually the end of that conversation. He doesn’t do it in a mean way but I can tell he is frustrated by my sexuality. lol. Ok, back to the story, A scene came up with Ross and his ex-wife (with her new wife) and he randomly looked at me with so much disgust and frustration and yelled “why did i marry you!!??” with his hands in the air in a frustrated form. I looked at him and was like wt??? and said “what?” I was genuinely confused cause like ???? We weren’t even having a conversation or anything, we were literally in the middle of dinner watching tv. I quickly caught on to what he was referring to in terms of his statement, and I instantly felt like shit. I told him he f’d up, and to not talk to me, and got up and went into our bedroom and cried. lol. He has said f’d up shit in the past but it’s usually during an argument after i’ve been a B**** for a while, but this hurt. It hurt more than it would have if it would have been said during and arguement. But no, he said it when we were peacefully having dinner. He looked so disgusted and frustrated at me when he said those words. Anyways, he followed me into our bedroom and started saying how if he knew I was bi before we got married (which he did) he wouldn’t have married me because he wouldn’t want to have people making fun of him for me being with a woman after us divorcing (him assuming that i would immediately get with a woman if we ever separated) I told him that if we ever did divorce, he should not care what I do after him. He spends his time saying how he doesn’t care about others opinions, so why does he suddenly care in that situation? It’s more like this hits his ego and makes him insecure I suspect. I let him know that i’m happy to accompany him to get a divorce if he isn’t able to accept me for who I truly am, and that if he is able to accept me, he needs to drop the subject and let it go, i am with him, not with anyone else. He should be focused on our marriage and not what I would or wouldn’t do in a hypothetical divorce. I told him he’s an id**t and that he is ruining our marriage by doing stuff like this, and said a few more things but quickly just told him to leave me alone, and that I did not want to speak to him for the moment. He said a few words but I honestly didn’t care to hear them and turned my back and fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night and didn’t find him in our bed but sleeping on our couch. Which he has never done before in our 3 years of living together. I guess I just need advice on how to proceed. He is a great person and husband, he is very loving and kind, and is a very open minded person and is accepting of everyone’s sexuality (except mines i guess) but his words hurt me more than anything else he’s ever done or said in the past, and I don’t know if I can get over that. I feel so sad. He really hurt me. I don’t know how to move forward. This morning we barely spoke and neither of us said I love you before heading out. Advice? 

TL;DR: My husband (27M) and I (23F) have been together for five years, married for two. He has known I’m bisexual since before we got married, but he has always been uncomfortable with it. Last night, out of nowhere during dinner, he looked at me with frustration and yelled, ""Why did I ever marry you?"" It hurt deeply because it wasn’t in the heat of an argument—it was random and cruel. He later told me that if he had fully processed my bisexuality before marriage, he wouldn’t have married me, because he doesn’t want people to make fun of him if we divorce and I end up with a woman. I told him that he either needs to accept me as I am or we should split, and I went to bed upset. He slept on the couch, which he's never done before. This morning, we barely spoke, and now I don’t know how to move forward. His words cut deep, and I’m unsure if I can get over them.

1kfh71n,relationships,My alcoholic bf of 9 years slept through my entire birthday and our plans,"As the title reads. I don’t have anyone who can relate to my situation so I’m posting it here. Im 33F and my bf is 36M. We have no kids but have 2 dogs and own a home together. I also have to add that currently he is NOT working and in between jobs atm. My birthday was 3 days ago and I’m STILL crying as we speak and so hurt by it, ugh. I’m not even big on birthdays, but considering how insanely busy my schedule has been for the past year (I’m a FT trade student, FT online student for my bachelor’s, and work 4 nights a week . I literally have no days off), I just wanted ONE day off work to relax and spend time with him. I thought the day we had planned was simple-I was going to my Saturday morning class and leaving by 11AM so we could go on a walk with our dogs and later go get ramen for dinner. In addition to this, I also asked if he could do the dishes that had been piled in the sink…Did any of that happen? Absolutely not, and I can’t believe I fooled myself to believe it would. 

This relationship was the best I’ve ever had in terms of our connection. It has felt so effortless and right until a few years ago where his alcohol problem started to quickly affect everything in our lives. Yes it’s a huge problem, he has lost every job he’s had due to attendance issues, it has bled into our relationship, and his promises with family or friends always end up with him flaking because he’s too hungover or want to stay home to get drunk. It’s like he knows he has a problem but doesn’t care enough at all to change it until shit hits the fan. 

I’ve been with one foot the door for a while which he has been completely aware of but I always let shit go because I don’t like holding grudges and I love him, but now I’m starting to see the big picture and how little he values me. This time it IS different and as much as I want to get over it, I just can’t let this one go. I can’t keep fooling myself to believe things will one day change when they’ve been faulty for years. Up until my birthday, I had no idea that was the last straw. The one day I was really excited for and even rescheduled with my parents was ruined because he decided to sleep all day until 5pm. He was also vomiting like crazy when he woke up.

I’m not saying I’m an angel, I have a tendency to say hurtful things when I’m upset and I’ve had my issues with alcohol (not even close to his extent) but I recognize when I’m fucking up and do my best to check myself. I just feel so hopeless now. I really thought I would be with this man for the rest of my life, but the fogginess is starting to clear up and I’m almost desperate at this point to get out. I’m tired of being an after thought along with our two dogs that HE wanted to adopt, but can’t even be bothered to walk them unless I bug him. He’s not the man I used to know and alcohol has consumed him. I reached out this his parents a few years ago, and they something similar to an intervention and he was actually doing good for a while, but sometimes old habits never die.  

This is already super long. I just never thought I would be that woman in her mid thirties that has to start all over again. I really wanted kids, but I just don’t see that happening with him and let’s be honest, my time is ticking. This is so unfair. I am now having to uproot my life and sell my dream home due to his repeated lack of effort. The birthday was just the cherry on top of all the issues I’ve brushed off for so long. As heartbroken as I am, I’m also eager for a new chapter. I deserve so much better and this relationship has dragged me down for too long. . I wish I could forgive him, but I just can’t keep playing myself. Deep down inside I don’t think he can change, and I can’t keep living like this. Please tell me I’m making the right decision to leave? 

TLDR: My unemployed alcoholic BF was too fucked up or hungover on my bday and left me to be alone all day, even though we had plans in advance. We have two dogs and own a home, but I can’t forgive him and his lack of effort.

1hdsk2g,relationships,I (m35) have been friendzoned by my wife (f34) (update) ,"Link to original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1e8m2zy/i_m35_have_been_friendzoned_by_my_wife_f34/

The long and short is she has a new boyfriend after having moved out a couple months ago. He's someone she's been talking to since the beginning of the year. Only recently it's escalated, supposedly.

I only learned of this due to a mutual coworker like fifth-hand knowledge. I called my soon to be ex wife to get confirmation. I said to her ""some news has gotten back to me, do you have anything you'd like to get off your chest?""

After a long pause, she says ""I went on a date."" I knew this already so I said... And??

""and it went well""... And?

""and there was a fainting incident in the hot tub""... And?

""and what?"" and yalls got freaky right?

""well... We tried some things..."" girl... Don't lie to me.

""yes, we were intimate."" OK bye. My 2% hope that maybe eventually we'd get back together is officially gone. We haven't even filed any paperwork and she's already done nasty with an online dude. I get it. I see. I'm aware.

Now I'm going back through our relationship and really looking at things. She really isn't a good friend or family member or person. She was a good wife until she wasn't.

Thank y'all for your feedback and support during this time. It's been a huge huge eye opener as far as how much emotional capacity I was giving her on a daily basis. I didn't have anything left for anyone else. Now I'm spending tons of time with friend and family trying to form and keep connections.

There's always good with the bad and that's what I've noticed so far. My brother moved in with me and he's honestly been a godsend.

Tl;dr: wife left and found new guy. You all were right. I had my head up my ass. Now I'm sad but trying to enjoy friends and family. Thank you for your support.

1lm1079,relationships,My (30F) fiancé (30M)  has slowly opted out of housework and now does nothing,"Hi everyone,

I (30F) live with my fiancé (30M), and we’re both doctors. When we first moved in together, we split housework fairly evenly. After some time, we had a few conversations and agreed to divide responsibilities , he’d take on the “bigger” weekly tasks like walking the dog, mowing the lawn, and deep-cleaning the house once a week, while I’d handle the day-to-day stuff like cooking, cleaning up afterward, laundry, dishes, and general tidying.

It wasn’t 50/50, but it felt like a fair trade-off at the time. At least both of us were contributing.

But a few months ago, he started outsourcing all of his tasks hiring cleaners, lawn services, even dog walkers. His reasoning is that he works hard, earns more, and can afford it. (He was raised in a pretty well-off family and has always been used to just paying people to do things.)

Now, he does nothing around the house. I, meanwhile, still have to cook, clean up, do laundry, tidy, and manage everything else ,while also working full time in a demanding job. He says he’s just tired and wants to relax. Well, so am I. But I don’t get to come home and drop everything at the door.

He’s genuinely a good person otherwise kind, loving, supportive. But this one-sided dynamic is eating away at me. I’m starting to resent him, and I don’t know how to bring it up without it turning into a fight.

TL;DR: My fiancé and I are both full-time doctors. He used to handle housework but has slowly outsourced everything he was responsible for. Now I do all the daily chores alone while he relaxes. He says he’s tired; I’m tired too. He’s a good man otherwise, but I’m quietly burning out and don’t know how to approach this without a fight.

Edit:Okay people are madder than I thought they would be.
First thing he did offer to pay up for my half of the house work as well but I did not take him up on it. He's not really a bad guy, I was just wondering how to have this conversation ",571,0.88,571,0,661.0,90.0,104,1751048197.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lm1079/my_30f_fiancé_30m_has_slowly_opted_out_of/,False,True
1jwcv6e,relationships,I found my bf’s Reddit account &amp; found out he doesn’t want to get married.,"This is my first time posting on here so sorry if this post is all over the place. 

I am 30F and my bf is 35M. We have been on/off dating for close to 6 years. Been together for a year now with no breaks. 

So a little while back my boyfriend sent me a few posts that he thought would interest me on Reddit. I was perusing through comments &amp; one in specific stood out to me, using his mannerisms, way of speech, etc. I just had a gut feeling it was him. 

Idk why but something compelled me to keep an eye on it. I probably should’ve let it go, but I couldn’t. After a while, he would talk about things he’s seen/commented on Reddit and all of the posts/comments I could see under this profile were spot on. He even mentioned something specific he commented under a post (I had read the comment already, so it confirmed it for me). No doubt in my mind that this is his profile now. 

I didn’t want him to think I was overstepping boundaries or anything, so I just never brought it up. And I did stumble upon it completely by accident. But I kept on reading the posts &amp; comments. It gave me this unique perspective into him and the way he thinks. But the trouble starts when I realized I didn’t really like what I was reading. 

He would make some degrading comments about women &amp; just in general I didn’t vibe with this person that I was seeing through his Reddit account. And then sometime last week I saw his comments under a post asking about relationship advice. The post was regarding some cheating that took place &amp; he said “this is the reason I’ve decided I will never get married”. I was never privy to this conversation. I knew he never wanted kids (neither do I) but I had always wanted to get married and up until now I thought he had too. It really shattered me to read this. 

Now I don’t know how to bring it up? When we’ve talked about marriage in the past he has seemed ok with it.

I don’t want to tell him I’ve been creeping his Reddit for about 6 months, but now I also know he never wants to get married. Do I break things off? But I can’t give him a valid reason. Do I bring marriage up to him again? What if he lies and says he does want marriage, but I know how he really feels …. 

What would you do in this situation? 

TLDR: found my bf’s secret Reddit saying he will never get married, but I thought he wanted to marry me. What should I do? ",567,0.93,567,0,613.0,46.0,70,1744330462.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jwcv6e/i_found_my_bfs_reddit_account_found_out_he_doesnt/,False,True
1hgbaxm,relationships,My little brother is going to ruin his life.,"I (23f) am worried about my brother (18m). 

He’s always been the “problem child” unfortunately, born addicted to heroin due to our mother using while carrying him. Our grandparents took us all in when he was just a baby so he doesn’t see our real parents as mom/dad, just our grandparents.

Again, always been a troubled kid, fighting at school, getting detention, beating up our other brother etc. 

Our grandpa passed away when he was only 11 years old. He was the closest with him and that really messed him up. Few years later our other brother also passed when he was only 17 from heart complications. My little brother was 14 when this happened. Ever since then things have gotten out of control.

Idk how to help him- he doesn’t want my help. He doesn’t want to talk about anything. All he wants to do is go out drinking DAILY, I mean DAILY. My grandma is still his guardian and he lives with her but she’s older and sick she can’t control him.

He threatens our grandma, getting in her face and screaming at her. He won’t get up and go to school, he won’t go to work. Literally all he does is drink and drink and smoke here and there.

He used to at least go to school, was involved with sports!!! (He’s very strong and athletic). But I can tell he has lost the passion for life. I’m scared he’s going to hurt himself, hurt my grandma, get hurt in a drunk driving accident (he doesn’t drive but his friends do and they boast about drinking and driving….) 

I just don’t know what to do. He doesn’t respect me or our grandma. We just want what’s best for him. He’s so mean on top of all these behavior things. It would be different if he was at least kind you know???

My grandma is at her last end with him. Once he graduates (if he can… he hasn’t been to school in months…) she’s kicking him out. He won’t be able to make it in life. 

How can I help him change? Have you ever experienced this with a loved one??? I’m scared he’s going to end up like our parents. And my brother will really be the only family I have when our grandma passes (hopefully in a long time)

TLDR; my brother has been acting reckless ever since deaths in the family, has addiction issues and won’t help himself. I’m scared for him and don’t know how I can help him. 


UPDATE: I’ve asked him if he wanted to hang out with me this weekend, if he’s with me at least he won’t be out getting into trouble. He usually never wants to hang out and will say he’s busy so he can go party but hopefully since it’s close to Christmas he will want to hang with me. It’s so hard trying to be close to him because he genuinely would rather be with drinking buddies over me. But at least asking will show him I’m trying my best.",573,0.97,573,0,591.0,18.0,60,1734444217.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hgbaxm/my_little_brother_is_going_to_ruin_his_life/,False,True
1iqj8fs,relationships,How do I (29M) approach my long term girlfriend's (29F) steadily increasing weight?,"When we first started dating 6yrs ago my girlfriend was ~130 lbs and my ""type"" has always been in that general range. Today I am 160lbs (6'1) and my girlfriend is nearing 200lbs (5'5). This isn't a recent development and has been a trend for a while, but I just never knew how to address it. It's been a steady upward trend since we first started dating. 

Obviously an extra 20-30lbs here and there is expected over the course of 6 years of dating and it was not a big deal to me in the beginning. However now I feel like it's reached the point where it's genuinely affecting my attraction to her. I really do try and  convince myself it's not a big deal, but at the end of the day it does affect our sex lives and how much I am attracted to her. 

I am not a health nut, but I generally watch what I eat and do some bare bones exercises and recreational sports leagues because I can't stand the gym. What's worrying to me more than the weight itself is that she  complains about her weight often, but chalks it entirely up to genetics and laments that it's completely out of her control. Obviously genetics do play a role in weight and metabolism, but without trying to sound judgy I can definitely say that her diet and lifestyle choices are also a contributing factor. For example she's big on rewarding herself with milkshakes and candy for special occasions or rough days.  

Anyways, I am sure this is not a unique issue and I am looking for advice on how to approach the subject. She'll ask me often if I still find her attractive because she knows she's a lot different physically than when we first met and it's getting tiring to lie about it. Without outright saying it, I've hinted at there being the beginning of an issue before and it immediately ends in tears and I feel terrible about it.

It's also, as shallow as it may sound, affecting my judgment now that we've definitely reached a point where everyone's expecting marriage around the corner. Obviously there's a lot to think about with any proposal, but I'd by lying if I said the steadily increasing weight wasn't giving me at least some pause once I start thinking about the relationship in the very long term. 

Is there a way I can approach this issue without the conversation turning hurtful? Genuinely aside from this one issue we've been doing great and I don't have any other reasons for pause.

1ogdhep,relationships,Bf left after seeing ex's engagement post,"Okay so, I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for a little over two years now. We just moved in together a few months ago. Last night we were doomscrolling on insta reels and his ex's post popped up abt her getting engaged

I don't rly know much about their relationship in detail other than her cheating on my bf with her current fiance while she was engaged to my bf (they were together for 5 yrs and it's been 3.5 yrs since they broke up), so ik that it didn't end well with them and it's just a sour topic so i never rly bring it up. I don’t follow her but she's kind of famous on insta as she is a food vlogger and I watch a lot of that content that's y she popped up.

Anyways when he saw it he like froze and became tense i asked him if everything was ok and he said yeah but i asked if that he looked tense because of the post he just brushed it off and rolled over to go to sleep and then thing is we didn't even rly cuddle when we cuddle like almost every night when going to sleep.

I woke up around 2 a.m. and he was gone. Like, completely gone.  he was nowhere in our house. I called him, like, 10 ,15 times. No answer ,Phone was switched off. I even called one of his friends, and they had no clue where he was. I was thinking of calling his mom but ik she would have blown his phone up so i decided to wait and call my frnd she also suggested to wait a few hours so i did

Then around 3:30 ish  he finally calls me back,i ask him wtf is he doing And he just says I'm fine pls don't call me rn ill explain later and he hangs up b4 i could say anything properly

I tried calling again obviously bcoz what does that even mean like I don't get why he would even be upset about that post seeing they broke up so long ago I can't imagine leaving your gf over this at night. He didn't explicitly say anything abt the reason he went off but I'm pretty sure it's bcoz of the post. I stopped calling him after a few times as hes not going to pick up i rly don't know what to do.

Things have been good with us until now this is the first time i have ever felt like I'm being betrayed by him. I don't even know where he is . Should I leave him alone and give him space I just feel sick abt this situation.

Tldr- bf left in middle of night after finding his ex got engaged and is not responding to me

Update-
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/BBZhLPoYPW

Posting again bcoz previous update post got removed for some reason.


Hey guys,
First of all, thank you to everyone who commented , I didn’t expect so many people to respond, and honestly, reading through your messages kept me from spiraling even more.

I tried to go back to sleep after the post. He did come back around 6 am .he looked like shit cuz ig he hadn't slept. He had just been driving around according to him. I didn't even know what to say to him luckily he was the one who talked first. He apologized a lot of times for running away and for ignoring my calls. I obv asked him wtf happened and why he would ditch me like that and abt his ex. He told me he had a panic attack and he didn't want me to witness it so he went to his car and after that he drove off . He explained that it wasn't bcoz he wasn't over her and that he never wanted her back(i asked him if he was still in love w her). He said it just happened after seeing that pic of them together and happy, he said he depressed after everything went down w his ex but he thought he was fine when he started dating me and that he has been rly happy.

But he panicked bcoz it hit him that she was actually happy and their break up hasn't affected her like it has him seeing she was with the guy she cheated on my bf with and he started overthinking that what if he could never be happy like that when  getting engaged again and getting married to me.

I was honestly a bit shocked at first bcoz we had talked abt how he would love to marry me someday and I didn't rly understand how to comprehend this info but we talked for like 2 hours and he was genuinely sry and he doesn't seem like he's not over her. 

He did say he wants to find that kind of happiness with me and he wants that future with me and he apologized again for being an asshole. I made it clear to him if he ever runs off like that we r done and he agreed and honestly we were both kind of crying by the end of our Convo and i also blocked his ex on my insta (he already had her blocked b4 anyone speculates)

I think i could forgive him. Thank you again for all your help the comments helped a lot. We might try therapy.

Tldr- he came back and we talked abt how he had a panick attack thinking if could be as happy as her and we resolved it out.

1hqtnlq,relationships,My wife is willing to let the baby sleep/cry in poopy diaper until I change him,"Me(34M) wife (32F) baby(7mM) length:9y


As the title states, this has been going on for a few weeks now. At first, whoever was free atm took care of it and not much problem occurred. But lately, I’ve noticed she’s avoiding the poopy diapers intentionally even if the baby poops on her watch. I would mostly take care of it coz I work remotely but after 3 or 4 times I requested she changes it this time. But she ignores me and let the baby cries in poop saying she doesn’t like the way I ask.
So I get up and change it coz I do get a little frustrated when she ignores me. 
But this kept happening even if I ask very nicely when I have done it a few consecutive times.

Because I am a night owl, I mostly take care of the baby at nights even when I have work tomorrow. So it’s not like I’m making her do all the work. She gets a good night sleep most nights and I wake up drowsy and tired. 

I feel like she’s emotionally blackmailing me because she knows I can’t let the baby suffer for long.
She knows I will do it if she just wait. Emotions are boiling over and I don’t know how to handle this.
Any advice on how to go about this?

Family is important to everyone in this story.  My husband is part of a very large Irish Catholic family where Sean has been used as a first or middle name for not just my husband's brother, but a few of his first cousins as well - not to mention his dad, grandfather, and great-grandfather.  We see my husband's immediate family regularly (5 siblings and his parents), at least a couple times per month.  


We plan to name our son Sean Francis Gallagher, in honor of both our dads.  We want the name ""Sean Gallagher"" to live on, and my husband and I both have a close relationship with his dad and want to show him this honor and respect (especially since he went out of his way to ask my husband to consider this, and he never really asks for anything).  Plus, my husband and I easily agree on the name (and don't agree on many others), and I love how it all flows.  (Again, the real names are different, but still very Irish).    


My brother in law and sister in law are DISTRAUGHT by this decision.  Soon after we found out we were having a boy, we asked them if they were okay with our choice, and they both said yes, but over the past few months they have apparently changed their minds and become VERY vocal, aggressive, and persistent about us not using the name.  According to my BIL, ""it's my name and belongs in my family going forward.  Whether I (or my son) use it or not remains to be seen - but the name and rights were passed to me.""  He says he doesn't want another ""Sean Gallagher"" in the same town who is not his son.  He says, ""it's pathetic you think you have to come in and save the day and name your son Sean to carry on some fucking meaningless honor or whatever it is you fucking believe. ... You think Dad is honored by you fucking up the family?  Did you think I was just gonna be cool with you stealing my name?""  He goes back and forth between saying that he chose the name ""Hudson"" and has absolutely no regrets about that - AND - he really wanted Sean the whole time and only agreed with his wife (who wanted a unique name) the moment before they left the hospital because she sacrificed to move across the country to where we all live.  He says they are now consideriong using ""Sean"" if they have a second son.  My BIL says that he never wanted to continue on the ""Sean Patrick Gallagher"" legacy and give his child a Roman numeral after his name, and that he discussed this with my FIL who ""agreed.""  He says talking about this topic makes his ""blood boil.""


My husband has said to his brother that him claiming to own the name is nonsense, and that ""any anger or resentment you've had toward me has been misguided from the start.  Your real issue should be with [sister in law], not me... but I do genuinely feel bad you were put in that position.""  He told his brother that the options were to (1) change Hudson's legal name to Sean Hudson Gallager, and still call him Hudson, or (2) get over it, since ""you had the chance to use the name and didn't.""  My husband has told my BIL on a couple occassions that it is obvious he regrets the decision to name their son Hudson, and that BIL should be ashamed of himself - and this is an extreme trigger for my BIL, who has threatened in person and over text to ""punch [my husband] in the face"" and make him ""fucking dead in the street"" if he takes another ""shot at Hudson.""


My sister in law has been calling and texting me about this too.  She said that it is impacting her relationship with BIL, since she pushed for the name Hudson.  She also said that Sean will NEVER get over this and that there will be a permanent rift in the family if we go through with this.  She said that it will be confusing and hurtful to her son Hudson and possibly my son.  YESTERDAY (TWO WEEKS BEFORE MY DUE DATE), she said she's upset that we're not considering her husband's feelings and that my husband is acting with malicious intent.  I responded and said, ""I'm really sorry it has come to this.  I stand by [my husband] and what he wants to do.  I don't think he has malicious intent toward Sean.  I think he feels strongly based on his relationship with his dad and has a different perspective than Sean about what matters - and neither perspective is right or wrong, they're just different.  I don't want to be involved at this point because the stress is not good for my baby or me, so I'm not going to be reading or responding to any more about this.""  After I sent that text, she sent a multi-paragraph text ending with, ""As the mothers, we have the full power to control this and my son has already been named, so this does fall on you.""  


My father in law has told us that he has told BIL and SIL that he is honored we're using the name Sean, that they need to move past this since they had the opportunity to use the name and didn't, and that they need to apologize to us.  


My husband and I both want to use the name Sean, but now we're having a small amount of doubt due to all this drama.  We also don't like that our baby will share a name with BIL, who we think has acted quite selfishly and immaturely, and we are worried that BIL might treat our innocent baby meanly.

1hripvv,relationships,"I [33 F] feel overwhelmed by the standards set by my husband [34 M] for ""domestic"" duties ","My \[33 F\] husband \[34 M\] and I generally have a very good relationship. We are still romantic with each other, enjoy each other's company; I have few complaints. We have been together since I was 20 and he was 21 so we have grown together and been through a lot together. He makes more money than I do and is financially generous. I don't have complaints about that. 

However, I would say around since getting married \~7ish years ago, it's as if there was a shift and he expects me to take care of anything in the ""domestic"" sphere and I find myself increasingly resentful of it. It's gotten really extreme the past two years (or at least feels that way.) We have two dogs and he get very annoyed if I ask him to walk them even once a day. I walk them (approximately 4 times a day) every day even when I'm sick or not feeling well. I have to rush home after work to walk them and usually go home at my lunch hour to walk them as well. Any vet care, medicine, food, etc. all falls to me. He loves them and plays with them (in fact, the first dog was one he adopted, so it isn't like I forced these dogs on him) but does not participate at all in their care. 

Similarly, he literally does not participate in meal prep or food. I do all grocery shopping, cooking, cleanup after cooking, etc. Even if we are ordering out, he acts too overwhelmed to have an opinion. If I did not try to keep our food intake somewhat under control, he would order fast food pretty much every day. I try to keep our food somewhat healthy and varied so that it's not junk food every night. His expectation for cooking is high as well; he likes large, complex meals so it's not like I can just throw some pasta in a pot with sauce. On nights I have done that, he complains and then usually orders fast food or pizza. So I feel a lot of pressure to cook elaborate meals every night. 

This will sound privileged, and it is, but we have a small-ish apartment in the city and then a larger house in the suburbs about \~2 hours away. We didn't originally mean to keep both the house and have an apartment but he really didn't want to sell the house when we had to move for his job about 2 years ago. However, this is just another thing that has fallen to my plate. We rent the house on a short term basis so I am constantly cleaning the house, tidying, stripping sheets, answering guest questions, etc. Also, trying to keep a large house to guest house/vacation home standards is a ton of work. I am constantly fixing or replacing something in the house, but mostly it's tons of cleaning. Again, he does not participate in this at all. Literally refuses completely, saying he's too busy with work. 

The thing is, about six months ago, I took a job that is almost fully in-person. I used to work remote and therefore I would manage to balance all these other domestic ""duties"" but this job I took is a better job, pays more, etc. My husband would complain about me making more money (even though we are honestly financially totally fine) so I found a job that pays more, but it's much more intense, so I don't have the time (or energy, frankly) to constantly devote to cleaning, cooking, etc. It was already hard when I worked remotely; I was always exhausted and burnt out. Now, I work 45 hours minimum in-person, so trying to keep both the house and our apartment spotless, clean, cook, etc. 

This comes up because I had a few days off over Christmas, and I admit I let myself ""slip."" The laundry room was piled with some clothes and towels. The dishes weren't done immediately every night. I was being a bit lazy. Well, he just picked a big fight with me saying he needed me to devote more time to keeping the house clean and that I was letting it ""get out of control."" 

I did argue back, saying I let it slip for a few days at most. He literally doesn't even put his food away or rinse his dish after eating. He does not take the trash out and has not cleaned a bathroom in probably minimum three years. So it seemed a bit rich to me to say the house was ""out of control."" 

I'm just tired of devoting so much of my time and energy to cleaning, cooking, domestic duties, etc. I feel as though time I could be spending towards things like reading, learning, working out, whatever, are spent worrying about getting the laundry done and cooking. It's just odd because in many other ways, my husband is feminist-minded, but not in this regard. He gets very defensive when I bring it up, saying he can't handle more on his plate due to his job. However, I'm also working like a dog at my job! So what gives? 

I'm sure many people have dealt with this. Is there a way to calmly get through to him that I need more help? A schedule perhaps? Duties that we know are our own? I am feeling more and more resentful towards him over this.

1kcn0bp,relationships,Update: my (28f) husband (32m) is disappointed/sad that spending time together makes me happy,"Tl;dr is basically the title. Here’s my last post if you want more info

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/zo1zaGPLCU

I had gotten in contact with a divorce lawyer’s office and had a brief consultation with a secretary. It wasn’t too long and I haven’t done much more gathering of info because I’ve had 10 different final papers/projects/presentations happening and just don’t have the time or energy to work on it right now.

Since his last comments things had gone back to getting better. We still spent time together with our toddler, and things were starting to feel fun and like we were getting closer again.

Then we went for a walk today.

On our walk he asked me how I thought things had been between us. I said I thought they’d been good, that I liked spending time together. Then I asked if he was still feeling the same way as the last time we’d talked about this. He basically said yes, that he’s disappointed that he’s the problem, and if it wasn’t for him we wouldn’t be in couples therapy. He also said that he doesn’t ask me to change anything for him (which is bs, he asked me to be poly with/for him). 

I felt frustrated at this, because I’m not asking him to change, I’m asking him to do what he had done our whole relationship before he changed. He used to make me homemade picnic dates, surprise me with my favorite snacks and coffee and drinks, or my favorite chocolates from a European style chocolatier. We’d go on a date every weekend, and hang out every evening. We’d text constantly, and always found new things to talk about even after almost 8 years. 

Then once the baby was born he began pushing me away, telling me I shouldn’t rely on him, while also pushing for a polyamorous relationship. He told me he would burn the fumes in his tank to make sure others were taken care of, but then tell me he couldn’t give me those same fumes when I needed him, or even anything from his tank when it was full.

It was so the opposite of how he used to treat me.

And I told him this on our walk. His response was to say he accepts that he was at fault, but I wouldn’t be convinced of his position no matter what he said. 

I told him that he’s not accepting he was/is at fault if he keeps trying to convince me otherwise.

In our next couples therapy session I’m going to bring up that I think we’ve been both-sides-ing the issues in our relationship. I’m guilty of participating in this, I’ll defend him and try to protect his ego and work together. But honestly? I haven’t done anything wrong in this regard. I’ve acted and reacted in an impossible situation that my husband has put me in.

I just don’t know why the birth of our child changed him so much, made polyamory into such a fixation of his when that time and energy for his “self discovery” should have been put into directly caring for myself and our baby. He keeps trying to make excuses that he didn’t get to do much the first year of her life, but he:

- went on multiple hours long hikes and dinners with his friend
- went on a solo camping trip
- slept over at another friend’s house for their birthday instead of coming to the first family outing I had planned since giving birth
- went hiking and rafting a couple times with the significant others of some of my friends
- went on dates with me
- went on dates with other people
- had dinner with friends
- went on solo bike rides where he’d be gone for multiple hours or even all day

And his comeback when I point this out to him? It’s not as much as he usually did before the baby, he only got to ride his motorcycle once or twice last year. I could have done all those things too! (Never mind that I was exclusively breastfeeding our baby, and going out anywhere meant having a portable pump and refrigeration options on hand, never mind a space where I could actually comfortably sit and pump for 20-30 minutes in the middle of activities). 


Idk. Just what the fuck happened? How did I go from a devoted and loving feminist minded husband to whatever he is now?

Whatever. I’m still going to try and fix things because maybe at some point he’ll see the light, but at the same time I’m going to begin to craft my exit plan.

My (32m) wife (29f) have been together 4 years and got married over the summer. Over the past two years, my dad (66m) has called my wife the wrong name 5 times. It’s not intentional, he’s just getting old. 

The first two times she really didn’t care and was a good sport about it, but understandably she’s getting more upset as it continues to happen, as it makes her feel very small. 

After the third time it happened I confronted my dad. He was really embarrassed and knows it’s a factor of his old age. It was hard to see how embarrassed he was. 

What do I do? My wife gets really upset, my dad gets really embarrassed, and it appears to be something we’re just going to have to deal with?

1ncsjse,relationships,My (40f) husband (40m) says I am killing our marriage by not drinking,"We're married 18 years. Have kids for 5. When we met I didn't drink but started drinking socially as my husband and whole peer group drank alcohol and I was feeling intense peer pressure. I did enjoy it (maybe even too much sometime), and had fun.

Over the years, especially at work events, I noticed that alcohol increases my anxiety, and despite feeling like an odd one out on many events, I switched to only drinking alcohol with my husband and family friends.

Then we decided to have kids, we kept trying and of course I stopped drinking when I got pregnant. Then I breastfed and had another baby, and at the beginning of this year finally finished breastfeeding.

Tried alcohol again a few times and didn't enjoy it at all. As if my taste buds just went bad and all alcohol just tastes horrible. Even from half a glass of wine I am getting migraines now, and on top of that my anxiety skyrockets to extreme, including panic attacks.

I've done a lot in the past half a year regarding my anxiety, focused on health, sleep etc. and decided to not drink or take anything mind altering at least until I am sure this is not going to affect my mental health negatively. Plus, we have kids now and I am the one waking up to them every morning - parenting is hard as it is, and introducing something that makes me feel worse in all aspects is not a great idea. I don't mind him getting a drink, don't judge him for that, although he keeps saying I do.

My husband is pissed. Devastated. He said it was fine while I had a reason and now I am just making up one. That alcohol is a dealbreaker for him and it was a big part of our relationship.  That I am taking a stance that will ruin our marriage. I offered to find other things to connect over, he refuses. A few months ago he wanted to get some wine - I also took a glass to keep him company but didn't drink mine beside a few sips and he got offended. Says no person in his life has turned down a drink with him except me and that he feels rejected and alone.

I get that and I don't want him to feel alone. I do not oppose to him having a drink or going out with friends. I like the company and happy to get something non-alcoholic when we hang out. Of course, the frequency of those events have decresed dramatically since having kids. We don't go on dates - I offered a few times and my husband refused saying it's because I don't drink. He keeps questioning me and saying my decision is ridiculous. He also said that I am singlehandedly killing our relationship by not drinking.

Frankly I have no idea where to go from here. He says we'll divorce or he'll find another woman to drink with. Unless I agree to a two drinks a week, he says our relationship is over.

I just don't understand this. Feeling completely lost. I don't think alcohol is the issue here, but according to my husband it absolutely is. He is not an alcoholic as far as I know. I understand it's about connection and we did drift apart during these crazy years of having kids. I neglected myself to take care of the family and our relationship took a hit. I am doing way better and actually making time to shower, go running, do better at work. Went to a psychologist to sort out anxiety and panic attacks. Made more time to spend with my husband. We mostly watch TV in the evening and continue home renovation in the afternoons. Weekends are traveling with kids. He refuses to go on dates with me, saying it's because I don't drink - although I don't mind him drinking.

I too, miss the connection we used to have and want to keep the marriage alive. There's also kids, who need their mom and dad. It sounds completely weird to me that the connection we had was alcohol, and I know it wasn't. It's my fault of completely neglecting myself and our relationship these past years, but I was in such a bad place without help and I don't know if I even was capable of doing anything differently. And now it just went to absurd - my husband is saying that I took a stance of not drinking and gave him an ultimatum, which in turn forces him to give me an ultimatum - drink or separate. I tried explaining why I don't drink but he doesn't understand it and says it's my whim which breaks the marriage.

How do I keep our marriage together? We used to be close, and happy, and I miss that a lot. He won't even hug me anymore, and now doesn't want to talk to me. I know he's hurt and feels alone and I want to reconnect, but he's been turning down my attempts.

TL; DR: I stopped drinking after getting pregnant and having kids. Cannot tolerate alcohol anymore, plus my anxiety skyrockets. My husband says I am singlehandedly killing our marriage and he'll find someone else unless I start drinking again. I want to keep our marriage together.

When we first lived together, he used to get up earlier than me and would send me a loving text every morning to wake up to. Tonight, I was deleting photos on my phone and saw a screenshot of one of these texts from 5 years ago that said something like ‘You are amazing. I love you and you’re my favorite person. I hope you have a great day.’ Seeing and remembering this felt kind of crushing because I haven’t felt that sort of love from him for a long time - maybe sometimes in short bursts, but never consistently. I started having thoughts like, ‘am I ever going to feel that adored again?’

We went to the dog park and he asked me what was wrong. I told him I was feeling down and why. He didn’t speak for several minutes and then I asked what he was thinking and he said he didn’t know how to take this, because he thought we were just going to have a nice time together, and he wanted to salvage the day. He seemed mildly annoyed. At that point, I felt so rejected, unseen and burdensome that I told him he could finish his walk alone.

We walked in different directions and finally talked in the car. I started sobbing and told him that I was already feeling sensitive, sad and vulnerable when we started the walk, and his reaction made me feel like shit. I told him it didn’t feel normal that I could be in that vulnerable state and he could react with zero empathy, tenderness or reassurance. He continued to get more frustrated and hostile as I continued to cry more. He finally admitted than since a difficult period two years ago, he feels like he has a ‘deadened’ response to my emotions. He believes that I have criticized him too much and it feels like I punish him constantly. He said my emotions feel way too big for him.

I told him I can’t be in a relationship like that, that I need empathy from my partner. 

Is there any salvaging this, or is my marriage over? What should I do? 

TL;DR my husband says he has a deadened response to my emotions - is there any way of fixing this or is it over?

1kvak7h,relationships,HELP- My fiancé gets emotionally dysregulated when I take care of myself or express needs,"I (32F) have been with my fiancé (35M) for several years. We own a home together, and we’ve been through some major life events—including the unexpected and tragic death of my father, followed two months later by an abortion I felt backed into, which has been incredibly painful for me emotionally.

Lately, I’ve been struggling with something I’d really appreciate outside perspectives on:

Whenever I take steps to care for myself or express emotional needs, my fiancé becomes emotionally dysregulated. For example, recently I told him I was having a really hard night emotionally (due to something very personal and triggering for me) and that I wanted to treat myself to a night at a hotel. I said it calmly and clearly—not in anger or blame. His response? He walked away and wouldn’t make eye contact. Later, he said he felt “blindsided” and was angry that I “sprung it on him.”

That kind of thing keeps happening.

If I express that I need more affection—like a love note now and then to feel reassured—or tell him I’m hurting and just need to be heard, he often shuts down, gets overwhelmed, or accuses me of “making up fake narratives.”

When I try to explain how I feel, he either denies it, flips it around, or spirals into a state where I end up comforting him for not being able to be there for me. It’s emotionally exhausting.

I’ve started to notice a pattern:
I express a need → he shuts down or gets upset → I feel dismissed and emotionally neglected → I question myself for having the need at all.
It’s killing my self-esteem, and I’ve started to shrink just to avoid triggering his dysregulation.

We’ve done couples counseling, and I’ve tried communicating in softer ways. He says he’s trying, and sometimes he is. But the recurring pattern is making me wonder: is this something that can change, or is it a fundamental incompatibility?

I don’t want to end things right now. In fact, I’ve taken some space (temporarily living in a short-term rental nearby) so we both have room to reflect. But I’m at a loss.

TL;DR:
My fiancé gets emotionally dysregulated when I express emotional needs or take care of myself, and I end up feeling neglected and silenced. Is this something that can change, or is it a sign of emotional incompatibility? Any thoughtful advice would mean a lot.

1mggsa9,relationships,I am thinking of ending my ten year relationship with my partner because he still has not asked me to be his wife.,"This is my first post so please go easy me. I don’t have any family really to turn to for advice. 
I (27F) have been with my partner (28M) since we were in high school (10 years ago). Without giving too much away as I know people on reddit, I changed a lot about my life and the direction it was going in so that he could follow his dreams and to support him. He knows and I thought (as we have had this discussion many times over the years) that he wanted the same thing as I, to get married. We had kids young, my daughter is 4 and my son is almost 9 months. I didn’t expect a ring sooner as I thought he was waiting as we were saving for our house which we finally moved into this year. We do not struggle financially. He’s got a decent paying job and I work night shifts which pays really well. I should add that I started working night shift not because I wanted to but because my job was more flexible with the kids and his job, as well as the sport that he plays after hours. I do a lot around the house and he does too but again the majority falls onto me. I did not mind this as I thought we were working towards the same goal.
We had an argument about six months ago when we wanted a new car, because I got upset as he had no problem spending $50000 on a brand new car for himself but could not spend a few thousand on a ring for me. Yes we had that money in the bank and currently have about $16000 extra so again money isn’t an issue. He had told me he had almost proposed a few years ago but then didn’t because he changed jobs. I expressed my feelings and desires and after that fight I thought he would within the next year. 
We don’t go out or do much by ourselves anymore due to the kids but we decided to celebrate our ten year anniversary by booking a hotel room and going out somewhere nice for dinner. He organised everything so I thought (and many others did too) that it was going to be the night… well… it wasn’t. I tried not to but that night I couldn’t stop thinking about it and got upset. The next morning he kept asking what was wrong and I told him. He said “I didn’t think you would be upset about that,” as in him not proposing. Turns out he’s not even thinking about it. I decided ten years was enough time and even if he did now it would not be the moment I always dreamed of, it would feel forced. Would I be wrong for ending our relationship because he hasn’t proposed after ten years? Our relationship is otherwise perfect and he is a great dad. I just know this is something I can’t get over.

So I guess things are going to go for the better. In my last post, I broke down some of my husband's behavior and how it's likely linked to undiagnosed ADHD. Several people suggested leaving him.

Some things I left out of my last post that now seem relevant:
- I am disabled and often use a wheelchair or cane to manage my symptoms. I have a hard time bathing and dressing myself. I am occasionally reliant on the help of others. Part of why he neglects himself and chores is because he works a full time job and has to help me.
- These weren't issues until my health began to deteriorate.
- Some of his behavior is rooted in PTSD from a highly abusive relationship.

I packed a suitcase and was getting ready to leave and stay with family when my husband came home. He saw the suitcase, asked what was going on, and we had an actual conversation. No avoidance or shutting down. He apologized, said he understood, and that he'd like a chance to fix things.

He set alarms on his phone to remind himself to do chores, etc. He Googled ways to manage ADHD without medication and called his doctor to set up an appointment to talk about getting evaluated for ADHD and PTSD. He called our church to set up some marriage counseling. And he started cleaning without me asking. All things he hadn't done before, even when I begged.

I think seeing the suitcase and realizing that I was really planning on leaving helped. Maybe I'm wrong and this is just his attempt before it gets worse again, but I think he's actually trying this time. Am I wrong to be hopeful here?

TL;DR
My husband seems to be making efforts to mend our marriage, but I'm not sure it'll last.

ETA: I didn't add my disabled status to the first post for a few reasons. 1) I just don't like talking about it. My disability is nobody's business. 2) He only helps me for about 15 or maybe 30 minutes a day, and they're low effort tasks as well. 3) I didn't think I deserved less effort in a relationship because I'm disabled. Unfortunately, some of you seem to think I do deserve less.",513,0.83,513,0,645.0,132.0,98,1750856257.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lk4ywk/update_im_24_f_thinking_of_leaving_my_husband_30/,False,True
1hn48cr,relationships,My husband [28M] can't seem to adjust to being employed and it's giving me [30F] the ick and impacting my mental health,"My husband (Mitch) has not had the easiest life, to say the least. When he was 11, he was in a random accident (not his fault) that put him in and out of the hospital for nearly a year, and left him significantly physically disabled from there on out. I won't go into specifics because they could be identifying for us, but basically he had to totally relearn to do a lot of things, and he'll have lasting impacts for the rest of his life.

He finished highschool as a top student and stayed at home for a few years before going away to college, and his income during those early adult years came from disability benefits because there weren't any typical ""college/highschool student"" jobs that would've been accessible for him. We met when he was a senior in college, and he got his first job about 6 months after graduating (he was 25 at the time, I was 27). He could have stayed on disability, but decided to work instead because disability benefits in our country are basically poverty-level wages. He's a fantastic artist and did commissions occasionally for spending money while living with his parents, but it still wouldn't have been enough to get by on his own.

In contrast, I've been very lucky. I started working summer jobs when I was 14, went to college right out of highschool, and spent most of my 20's working in an extremely demanding but well-paying field. However, two years ago I ended up having to take a leave of absence due to severe burnout from the stress and schedule of my job. I did some soul-searching and, with Mitch's encouragement, decided to leave that career and pursue another field that is much less stressful for me, but also pays far less. I was initially happy with the decision, but now I'm not so sure I made the right choice.

Basically, while Mitch is normally pretty emotionally mature in other contexts, his attitude toward work reminds me of a petulant teenager. I've tried to be patient and remind myself that I've had over 15 years to adjust to the realities of working life while he's only had 3 years, but it's not getting any better and it's really starting to impact how I feel toward him and my life choices in general.

I don't need him to be super career-driven or anything; I married him knowing that just isn't who he is, and that his art would always be his main passion. And I don't expect him to exactly be overjoyed at the idea of trading half his waking hours for money for the rest of his adult life because, hey, who doesn't wish they could just do whatever they want all the time and not have to worry about it? I just wish he could...grow up a little, for lack of a better way to phrase it.

I've started to dread being around him during the work week, because I'm not exaggerating when I say that he's in a constant bad mood. We all complain about work sometimes, and a normal amount wouldn't bother me, but this is truly above and beyond. Endless reiteration of the same complaints about how much he hates having a job, heaving dramatic sighs constantly, sulking and pouting and irritable, always finding any possible way to turn any topic into a comment about how working is ruining his life. Most of Sunday is also spent in a funk bemoaning how horrible it is that he has to go in the next day. Sometimes it seriously feels like he thinks the entire concept of having a job was invented just specifically to make him miserable in particular. It truly makes my skin crawl, because at times he sounds like a sullen teenager instead of a nearly-30-year-old man, and it's seriously impacting my attraction to him.

I've tried every productive approach I can think of. At first I thought maybe it was just that specific workplace that sucked (the first job in a new field always does, right?), so I helped him find and apply for a better one. That worked for about three weeks and then it was right back to the nonstop sour mood. I encouraged and supported him when he decided to drop down to part-time...and again, he was doing better for a couple weeks and then it was right back to the same old thing, only now with added complaining about how he's making less money. I've started just paying for certain things we need out of my own account instead of our joint one and not telling him, just because I'd rather do that than hear another rant about how much it depresses him to know that thing cost X amount compared to his last paycheck and how unfair it all is.

At this point I'm at my wits end and have even offered to just go back to my old career so I'd be making enough money for him to quit working entirely. He refused, saying he wouldn't be comfortable with that because he doesn't want anyone judging him for being lazy or scrutinizing how he spends his money. Fair enough, I probably WOULD be resentful of a partner who doesn't work...but would I really resent that more than I'm already resenting the current situation? Part of me almost wants to just do it anyway because sometimes it's truly tempting to be at work doing crazy overtime but making lots of money, instead of at home listening to a grown man pout and sulk about the same thing every day. It's like nails on a chalkboard and it drains my emotional energy completely.

One final important thing to note is that Mitch is already in therapy, but that's focused on addressing his PTSD related to the accident that caused his disability. So while I do think talking with someone about this could potentially help, I don't think that can be the priority for a while.

With all this in mind, is there any way I can approach this topic with him that might actually get through without just torpedoing our relationship? I'm worried he'll just decide to bottle everything up instead if he thinks he's complaining too much, so I'm really hoping someone can advise a more productive way for me to talk to him about the root issue.

tl;dr due to disability, husband didn't get his first job until his mid-20's. He still isn't adjusting to the realities of having to work, even after several years, and his constant angst over it is impacting my ability to feel close and attracted to him. How can I talk to him about this without him having a meltdown or flipping a 180 and just bottling stuff up?",517,0.84,517,0,639.0,122.0,91,1735265033.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hn48cr/my_husband_28m_cant_seem_to_adjust_to_being/,False,True
1jf06au,relationships,I (23F) love my boyfriend deeply (33M) but something inside me is SCREAMING to break up with him,"There’s not much more to it than that. I woke up about 3 weeks ago realizing how much my life had changed and that everything felt wrong. We have been together for the last year and a half but dating on and off since I was 19. He’s wonderful. So supportive, loving, I’m very attracted to him, we have so many shared interests, I love his family, etc. We’re in similar circumstances work wise as I started working full time at 18 and am solidly in a blossoming career. 

And yet something inside of me is screaming that I want to be alone and 23 and not have my whole life tied up in a man 10 years my senior who I met when I was what *feels like* a baby.

It’s like I can feel my brain cells coming together and I just want out. And I feel TERRIBLE about it and very confused. 

A lot of this page talks about love being a choice as much as a feeling, that “falling out of love” isn’t real and signifies immaturity and shallowness. I don’t think that’s what’s happening here, but I am very confused and scared that I am a bad person for these feelings. 

If anyone has any words or thoughts or support or criticism. I will take it all. I need perspective from people who don’t know me personally.

TLDR: I love my boyfriend so much but my gut is telling me to end things.",515,0.87,515,0,605.0,90.0,168,1742399452.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jf06au/i_23f_love_my_boyfriend_deeply_33m_but_something/,False,True
1kavw6p,relationships,My (22F) boyfriend (22M) keeps letting his friend (24M)  come on our dates.,"UPDATE: I broke up with my ex (I’m gonna call him X) I went to where we agreed to meet up, and guess who he brought with him…you guessed it LIAM! I was very annoyed at this point, I told him I wanted to speak with him privately, and he brings fucking Liam. It’s very uncomfortable to break up with someone in front of their best friend, but I was too pissed, I told him “I said I wanted to speak privately“ he said “say it in front of Liam” eventually I just get annoyed and say “thats it! I don’t want Liam always here in our private life, on dates, everywhere“

he basically said, remember what I told you about Liams circumstance, blah blah blah. I said something like, “I’m sorry, but I don’t give a fuck about what Liams going through right now, this is about me breaking up with you” meanwhile Liam is just standing there…looking confused? I’ll get back to this later. So we basically get into a fight in this park, and it gets to the point where I tell him that he manipulates me into not kicking Liam out of our dates, and about everything he told me Liam went through (like a brother to X, saved X life, dead mom, dad absent, no siblings, friends, or girlfriend)

and then X looks like he got caught or something, and Liam gets angry saying like, “what did you tell her” this is all really funny and really awful at the same time. It turns out…NONE OF WHAT X TOLD ME WAS TRUE. Liam has a fiancée, has a REAL brother and sister, and his mom isn’t dead! So, anyway, definitely broke up with X. Like, 40 minutes later, Liam DMs me basically saying that X told Liam that I wasent ”comfortable“ being alone with X, and that he thought I *wanted* him to be on the dates.

Sir, what? he said the reason why he agreed is because his fiancée is living in Europe to finish up her study abroad program, and he had nothing better to do. So X just flat out is a liar, glad I broke up with him, mad I got lied to, but oh well. This was honestly not a turn of events I was expecting, and I have to get it out somewhere. END OF UPDATE.

|||EDIT: I called my soon to be ex boyfriend to meet up, and I’m gonna break up with him, I’m gonna tell him the exact reason honestly. I swear if Liam is there though, like, I’m not considering the possibility of not breaking up with him. It’s not even just because of Liam, its that he manipulates me into letting Liam come.

Ok, how we got into this predicament in the first place, is that my boyfriend just really likes his friend (Liam) he’s like a brother to him, he saved his life once, etc. But he’s on ALL our dates.

I even brought one of my single friends on a date (so we could double) and Liam and her don’t date, so that failed. I’ve honestly asked my BF “why Liam is on our dates“ and he says that Liam is, lonely, has nobody else, and he has NO SIBLINGS or girlfriend.

but then my boyfriend kind of guilts me because (I know this sounds awful) Liam is the fucking package for guilt! His Mom died when he was young, then his Dad and him don’t talk anymore, so Liam just doesn’t have anyone else to talk to.

I honestly think my boyfriend is guilt tripping me, and I don’t think I can do this relationship anymore. If nothing changes I’m leaving, this has gone on for 3 months.

Like, sure, I feel bad For Liam, but I don’t really know him, and its not my problem. its also not just dates, movie nights, hes here. Going to the mall, hes there, where is he not.

TL;DR my boyfriend keeps bringing his friend on our dates, and basically guilt trips me into not kicking his friend out.

also, I know this sounds made up, I still can’t believe it, but it is very much real. And I basically just need validation that its ok to break up with my boyfriend over this (the whole post).||",504,0.94,504,0,538.0,34.0,36,1745953067.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kavw6p/my_22f_boyfriend_22m_keeps_letting_his_friend_24m/,False,True
1iuhor9,relationships,I (28m) don’t know how to tell my gf (25f) that she reeks of p*ss,"I (28m) am living with my gf (25f) of 2 years in a two bedroom apartment. She has a condition triggered by her medication that causes her to occasionally have accidents in her sleep. I understand this is her personal struggle first and foremost, so I don’t fault her at all. However, I fear that she has become nose blind to the increasing stench of urine from her room. Shame is the last thing I want her to feel but the smell is becoming unbearable. When her door is open even just a few inches, the smell fills the apartment and I can even smell it from my room. We already sleep in separate beds in separate rooms, so I don’t feel like I have much leg to stand on in bringing it up as a legitimate problem. Honestly, I’m not sure if the increasing smell is also a sign of a higher frequency of accidents which is a separate worry about her health. Basically, I have no idea where to start in having this conversation. Do I focus on her health? I am somewhat worried but I know she already feels embarrassed by this very personal problem and I’m just not her doctor. Do I keep it to my personal concern of the smell and try to ask with grace that she take better care of it? If I center my discomfort she may feel pressured to act more but I don’t want her to feel alone in her struggle. Is this just something I should accept as part of living with her? Of course, I should discuss with her directly but, I just have no idea how to bring up Her struggle as something that’s starting to bother Me. I’m scared to make her feel ashamed and tell her how I’m affected especially without presenting any additional solutions. I simply don’t have the verbiage to bring this issue up at all.

1kx0ne0,relationships,My BF/27 wants his autistic brother to live with us when his parents can no longer do so and it scares me,"TLDR: My BF/27 wants his autistic brother to live with us when his parents can no longer care for him. I’m scared because I don’t think I can

I 26/F have been with my 27/boyfriend for over 7 years now. And we’ve been starting to talk about leveling up our relationship to the next level. He’s a good man and I do love him but I’m really scared about the future.

For context, he has a 20yo sibling who has severe autism. He has a brain of a 2-year old. Cannot communicate (but somewhat understands a few words based on his reactions), and does vocal stimming. Right now he’s under the care of both of his parents.

My bf told me that when the time comes that his parents can no longer take care of his brother, he plans to take him in with us. And that just scared me. I’m a light sleeper, so if he does vocal stimming at night (at worst, every night) idk if i’m ever going to get enough sleep. He seems kinda violent sometimes (at one point, he pulled my hair really hard at their family gathering for no reason). And I also want to have a dog in the future but I’m not sure if he’s going to be okay with it? (Right now they have dogs but they don’t let them inside the house). And what about if we have kids… how are they going to react. To add, he also poops everywhere and literally needs to be monitored 24/7 because he does a lot of things like drinking water from the toilet, or eating things he shouldn’t. As a person who loves to travel, I feel like when he starts living with us, we won’t be able to travel as a complete family as he would have to stay with him.


There’s all sorts of questions in my head and anxious thoughts that weigh so much. I don’t want to breakup and sometimes I blame myself for not thinking through this from the very beginning. But I don’t regret every single moment with my bf. I love him so much and I was ready to be his bride… not until this thought came into the picture.

1hhbjp6,relationships,Boyfriend has repeatedly “forgot” to get me Christmas and birthday gifts. He’s now upset because I don’t feel like getting pizza with him.,"I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (21 M) for a little over 4 years. The first year he was great about gifts and making me feel loved and remembered. After that I didn’t get anything. I would remind him months, weeks, and days (even the day before) before my birthday or Christmas. Not once has he planned to take me anywhere, or bought a gift ahead of time. I have never unwrapped a birthday present from him. I usually get upset, obviously, and cry. Then we go out and he usually buys something that I pick out. I hate this. I have told him I hate this. I give him hints all year. I straight up tell him what I want. Last year he bought me a silicone ring that wasn’t my size and was a pattern I didn’t like. He did not return it to get the size I wanted. So no gift. This year he just didn’t get me anything at all. Like 2 weeks after my birthday I saw a purse I wanted at a thrift store and he bought me that. We aren’t super well off, but he spends hundreds of dollars a month on tools and parts to add onto his cars. He also spends money on video games and useless subscriptions he doesn’t use. I don’t want him to spend money on me. Over the years I’ve told him repeatedly that my perfect birthday would be getting flowers, a handwritten note (hard on this because I love notes and he claims that he can’t write so that’s why he never does it), and then a dinner date. That’s literally it, I feel like it’s not crazy to ask for just that for my birthday. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just pity. But I’m so exhausted of this.

He works on his birthday in a couple days so we had planned to go to get pizza at his favorite spot after he had his first therapy appointment today. Therapy place is in the same town as the pizza place which is an hour away. Well we’re both sick so he canceled his therapy. This morning I asked him “so we’re not going anywhere today? No plans?” And he confirmed that we didn’t. Now all of a sudden he’s really upset that we aren’t going to get pizza still. I’m obviously confused so I tell him I don’t really want to go because he doesn’t have therapy anymore, we’re both sick, and I don’t eat pizza. We’d also have to take my car as his needs new tires and the roads are snowy. 

Now he’s in bed sulking because “going there for my birthday was the only thing I wanted.” Is that guilt tripping? Idk I’m too close to him to figure out if I’m overreacting or what I should do. I want to make him happy and celebrate his birthday like I always do. But I can’t let myself do it. I get emotional and sad every time I try to plan anything. 

Another catalyst for this is that I live painting. LOVE IT. I’m really artistic and I have been trying to get him to join me in creating ANYTHING for the last four years. He never has. He’s refused painting, making ornaments, drawing, everything. I have been really bothering him about it the last two weeks because I always humor him when he wants me to join him in helping with his cars. I am not mechanically gifted and it’s not the most fun for me, but I like spending time with him and seeing him do what he loves. I guess I need advice on how to get him more involved and what I should do about his birthday and Christmas. I already have gifts picked out for both. What do I do? I don’t think I’d be happy if I blew him off on his birthday. I want to celebrate him. What’s the best way to make sure that I’m happy and he’s happy without being petty or vindictive?

1m4w80a,relationships,"I (31m) am worried about how I'm going to handle being away from my wife (33f) for an extended period of time when she goes on a once-in-a-lifetime trip, and I don't know what to tell her.","My (31m) and my wife (33f) enjoy a really strong marriage (four years, together for seven years total) but would be the first to tell you that we are rather codependent. We have friends and some hobbies separate from each other but generally we do most things together, and this has gotten 'worse' since we both began WFH a few years back.

This fall my wife will be taking a nearly three week trip with her immediate family to her parent's home country, where they'll be spending time with their extended family. This is a really meaningful trip for my wife that I fully support - it will likely be the last time she sees her grandpa, and she has not been able to visit in over a decade. I was invited but due to work conflicts am not able to swing more than just a few days of flying out there, and given that it is halfway across the planet we determined that it wouldn't be worth it for a weekend (as I'd spent 70% of it flying.) She originally did not want to take this trip without me as she also has concerns about being away from me (for her own mental health, not just mine) but I talked her into this as it is a really special opportunity for her.

My wife and I have never been apart more than four or five days. The last time she took a work trip for a little less than a week, I became very depressed, anxious, and largely just stewed at home. While I have nearby friends and family I can visit, I didn't feel the drive to at the time despite saying ""oh I'll get dinner with such and such"" before the trip. We have two dogs that I cannot take with me, so I couldn't just go shack up with my parents or something either. I understand that this portion of the question has more to do with my own hangups and not something r/relationships would address.

**My concern:** My wife and I do not keep almost anything from each other, and I know she is very worried about me. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and some other mental health issues and my wife has always been an incredible partner and supporter in my recovery - at times almost as a crutch for me unfortunately. She has expressed to me a few times that she is worried about how I will do by myself. While I've made some progress with my mental health since the last time we were apart for an extended period of time, and have also already scheduled out specific days I'll be hanging with friends, family, and made plans, I do have a nagging thought in the back of my head that I will again slip in a fugue state for a few of the days. I want to tell her this because we're usually so open, but I'm afraid if I do she will be pre-occupied with me during the trip, or perhaps cancel outright.

(I do want to make it clear here that I cook, clean, take care of myself and the house, etc. This is purely emotional/mental concerns I have.)

TL;DR: Codependent marriage, wife is going away for over two weeks, I am worried about how I will manage without her. I am not sure if I should tell her this as I don't want to ruin her vacation. Thank you :)

**edit:** Thanks to anyone who has taken the time to reply so far. I do want to add that this is something that I am already speaking to a therapist about as I have been doing CBT and ERP therapy for different things (though this particular matter has not been a focus until recently) on and off for a few years. We are not currently in active marriage counseling but it is likely something we will do in the future. **In this thread I am hoping to get specific feedback for my question on to what extent I should discuss this with my wife vs. what I need to do re: therapy, etc. I'm already very, very, aware that this is deeply unhealthy and I appreciate your concern.**",492,0.85,492,0,597.0,105.0,81,1753036071.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m4w80a/i_31m_am_worried_about_how_im_going_to_handle/,False,True

His reasoning for him needing me home at a normal time is that he has to wait until I get home to have dinner, that when I’m not home the dog doesn’t get walked till late therefore I’m neglecting the dog and him being annoyed that I have to leave again to walk the dog (our dog gets walked twice a day by me and if I’m at work, gets a visit during the day for a toilet break and snack, before my partner gets home at 5) and it’s also not fair that he has to sit around bored waiting for me to come home so I need to make a change, because if not he won’t be staying and putting up with it. 

I’ve tried explaining that it’s only a few evenings a week that I’m not here, I’ve prepped dinners so that all he has to do is cook them and told him I’m happy to reheat mine when I’m home but he “can’t be arsed” and I, inevitably, end up cooking for us when I get home. I’ve suggested he can take the dog for a nice walk before I finish, if he is that bored, therefore meaning I can spend more time with him but he won’t do it because “your dogs not trained and pulls” but he hasn’t walked the dog in forever and won’t accept he doesn’t pull anymore. I feel like I’m offering solutions to his predicament but am meet with excuses. I told him if he helps me, it ends up helping him 

This is just one issue of many he has at the minute, he is becoming completely overwhelming with his ADHD that he isn’t taking anything for and refuses to go to the doctors about it. He puts time schedules on everything (on himself, just as much as me) and if something isn’t done by a certain time then his mood is just dreadful, and I’m pretty sure he has some sort of OCD because god forbid anything gets left laying around. 

I find work to be a distraction from my home and personal life at the minute as my family are going through some difficult situations and with me having to deal with my partner on top, I am really reluctant to reduce my hours. On one hand I’m tempted to try and change them to stop him complaining, even if it means I lose money this way, but on the other hand I’m like “f**k him, if he wants to break up with over a few hours of work then he can leave” and the whole situation is seriously draining me. I can’t figure out if he’s just being controlling or whether he does just want me home to be together.

What should I do and how can I cope with his current fixation? 

TL;DR my partner has an issue with my working hours and wants me to reduce them because he wants me home at a decent time to do all the things he can’t be bothered to do, such as cooking dinner, walking the dog etc, but then moans we don’t spend time together. I’m also reluctant to change them because work is a distraction for me.

1kmivds,relationships,How do I tell my girlfriend we need to lose weight?,"**EDIT**  The title is misleading; I do not plan to ever explicitly tell my girlfriend that she needs to lose weight. She has explicitly told me she wants to lose weight.

My (22M) girlfriend (22F) have been together for 10 months now. Throughout the relationship, we have been eating pretty unhealthy since we go out to eat and get sweet treats all the time. Recently, I've noticed that we both have gained a fair amount of weight (more her). I've started to do more exercise than usual, but the most challenging part is diet. 

She acknowledges that she needs to lose weight, and has said that she wants to exercise with me. However, whenever I tell her to get ready, she never wants to actually go. And the hardest part is the diet; she has said that she doesn't need to cut down on foods and that all she needs is exercise. I try telling her that diet is more important but she doesn't seem to think that.

Whenever we go out, she still wants to eat unhealthy things (soda, ice cream, Starbucks, other foods), and it's harder for me to lose weight because she wants me to eat that too. How do I be firm with her and tell her to stop eating unhealthy and actually exercise? I really don't want to be harsh.

1ibbl0g,relationships,UPDATE - I posted to this subreddit seven years ago about my very dysfunctional relationship and I just found my old post/account,"Trying this again since I broke a post rule the first time-
Here was the original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/DaAmvwsWYs

Not that I tried very hard to find it before now, but curiosity got the best of me after recalling a bunch of well-meaning strangers basically responding ""wtf"". The feeling of shame was visceral.

I fully understood I was in an effed up relationship but couldn't find the courage or self respect to leave. it was this immense dissonance that I can't describe to this day and I have a hard time talking about it in therapy still.

It was just surreal (and painful) reading it. There were a few very compassionate yet stern comments which I'm grateful for in retrospect.

Anyway I (29f) am now married to the most wonderfully caring, loving, respectful, sweet person on this planet (31m) who I am excited to have a future with instead of being full of dread, we have been together for five years and married for a few months. and I'm really happy that post feels like it was written by a different person in a different lifetime. Life feels so much lighter than it used to. There's no other point to this post, except maybe to comment that manipulation is one hell of a drug.

1mytvhp,relationships,UPDATE 6 years later. My (16M) relationship with my mother (50F) is crumbling and I don’t even know if I want to try to save it.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/uMdFVkf78M - Link to the previous post.

Trigger warning - Mention of suicide.

So, uh, hi! I posted here nearly 6 years ago about how strained my relationship with my mother had become after she closed herself off from both me and my father because of her obsession with politics (again, not gonna get into it!). A lot of stuff has happened since then so I figured I could make an update.
I debated for a while if I should even make this update since, after all, it’s been half a decade since I made the original post and it didn’t even get that much attention. In the end though I think it will give me a bit of closure which has been difficult to find otherwise.
Oh and again, English is not my first language yada yada sorry for any mistakes.

For starters I ended up moving out permanently from my mother’s house not long after I posted. We had a couple big arguments about her behavior in which she kept insisting that she had done nothing wrong and I should not be upset at her. I tried using some of the recommendations I got from people here (some of which were… questionable, to say the least) such as setting some clear boundaries with her, but nothing really worked. The straw that broke the camel’s back though was when she told me that my uncle’s (her brother’s) cancer had come back only as a way to hurt me since she didn’t mention it before to avoid causing me even more stress; she kept that information in her back pocket until I pissed her off enough to want to hurt me, so yeah, really nice of her.
As I mentioned before I moved out, and I ended up living with my dad and my grandma a couple towns over. By then I was getting close to turning 18 so there wasn’t much she could do to stop me, and to her credit, she didn’t.

After that last incident I pretty much cut her off, and it has stayed that way up until now with a couple exceptions. The main one being that my grandfather ended up passing away in 2022, so I reestablished contact with her partly as a way to try to make my (other) grandmother happy after, you know, her husband died, and partly because in a way I did miss her.

As you might guess it did not work out. At first things seemed to be going slightly better than last time, since she didn’t push as hard for my affection and seemed more respectful of my boundaries. That was until Christmas of that same year, when she told me that she was going to commit suicide once her mother died since “there was nobody in the world who loved her”, not so subtly implying that it was my fault. That obviously shook me, but more than that it made me angry. I realised that it was most likely a bluff to guilt me into forgiving her for everything, and that even if it wasn’t, it was not a burden I should have to carry on my back, so I cut her off again, this time for good. 

Other than that and for me personally, these years have been a bit of a rollercoaster, with quite a few highs and lows: I finished highschool, got into college, gained 40 kg, lost 25 of them, got really depressed, slowly crawled out of it, made some new friends, lost some old ones… 
Right now though I’d say that I’m better than ever. I turned 22 a few months ago, and for the first time in a while I look forward to the future. I just graduated from college (I’m officially a historian now!!!), I already got into the master’s I want to do, I have a pretty chill job, and next year I’m planning on staying for a few months in Belgium thanks to a EU program.
Things are not perfect of course, but I have a strong support system which has helped me not completely fall apart these last few years. My dad in particular has been my rock all this time and our bond is stronger than ever. Even though him and I are very different, and he didn’t always know how to help me, he really gave it his all and I couldn’t be more thankful.

So yeah these (almost) 6 years have not been easy, but I feel like I have come out on the other side happier and stronger. Thanks again to the people who gave advice last time, and have a good one!

1hydvac,relationships,I lost my my wife to her phone...,"**TL;DR**: My wife spends more time on her phone—whether it's following a new religion, talking to her sister, or scrolling social media—than she does with me or our children.

My wife and I have been married for 13 years, we’re both 36, and we have two children. Things were relatively straightforward in our relationship until about 4–5 years ago. Around that time, several life changes occurred: she started following a new religion, her sister went through a divorce, and she got deeply involved in some of her friends’ personal dramas. These changes have led to a situation where she now spends more time on her phone than engaging with me or our kids.

It started with the religion. I’m not entirely sure of the specifics, but she began observing a Sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset. She also started listening to podcasts filled with conspiracy theories and following an American preacher who focuses on topics like Christmas being pagan (which is true but not the entire point) and wild theories about the New World Order. She’s often glued to her headphones, and I’ve stopped sharing details about my day because she either doesn’t hear me or seems impatient to return to her videos.

This change affected our lifestyle. We stopped watching TV shows together because anything with witches, magic, or Christmas themes led to her asking to switch to something else. It’s also become challenging to meet friends, as she refuses to go out on Friday evenings or Saturdays.

Then came her sister’s divorce. My wife spends most of the day on the phone with her sister now. Sometimes, they’re not even speaking—they just have the phone on as background company. For example, I pick my wife up from the train station at 5:30 PM, and by the time we’re home 10 minutes later, she’s already on the phone with her sister. She even lets the bath overflow because she’s so distracted by their conversations.

Thursdays are the one night she’ll sit with me to watch TV, but she’s usually scrolling through Instagram instead. On Mondays, she goes to bed early but wakes up at midnight for a prayer session, which she says is the time when spirits are most active.

Saturdays are particularly tough because of her Sabbath. She spends the entire day in bed, reading the Bible or sleeping. I recently watched an old video of me playing with our son at the park, and I heard my daughter’s voice in the background. For a moment, I couldn’t figure out who was watching her, but then my wife appeared in the video. It hit me that this was over four years ago—the last time she came to the park with us.

To sum up, my wife is almost always on her phone, whether it’s following sermons, talking to her sister, or just scrolling. It feels like she’s disconnected from me and the kids, and I don’t know how to address it anymore.",487,0.96,487,0,508.0,21.0,56,1736540390.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hydvac/i_lost_my_my_wife_to_her_phone/,False,True
1oh8v74,relationships,My (35f) mil (60f) only wants provide childcare for our daughter(3 months f) not our son (3m) and my wife (33f) and I are not on the same page as how to handle this.,"Hi everyone,

My mother-in-law initially offered to help with childcare one day a week and seemed enthusiastic. However, after our daughter was born, she made it clear she only wants to care for her. She claims it’s “fair” because she didn’t help with our son when he was a baby and my mother did. 

For context, we did offer before our son was born and my mother offered, but when we asked, my mil reacted like a deer in headlights, so we dropped it. We’ve had multiple discussions since, explaining that we don’t agree with her only wanting one child, and she seemed to understand—but a week later, she goes back to only wanting to care for our daughter and pretending we agreed to that. 

We’re unsure why this is happening. It might be because we’re a lesbian couple and she only wants to bond with the child she is biologically related to, or maybe she wasn’t ready before but is now. Either way, she has said multiple times that she doesn’t want to take care of our son. She has said this in front of our son. 

I feel like the weekly childcare arrangement is off because I don’t trust her to care for both children equally. My wife feels that we haven’t explicitly said she must take both children or none, and that we should give her a chance. 

This argument is devolving in my wife saying I'm trying to isolate her from her parents and I'm treating her like she is a bad person. I just want to protect our kids. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I truly offer her another chance?

tl;dr my wife and I heavily disagree how we should handle my mil wanting to play favourites with childcare",488,0.92,488,0,534.0,46.0,104,1761553246.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oh8v74/my_35f_mil_60f_only_wants_provide_childcare_for/,False,True
1n9f5gk,relationships,How do I navigate my wife's fight-or-flight moments? I'm on the edge of calling it quits.,"I'm a 32-year-old male, and my wife is 30. We've been together for 10 years, married for 8. Over the past couple of years, my wife has developed a pattern of getting triggered into intense fight-or-flight responses (mostly fight) when it comes to me or our kids. This seemed to start around the time she began going to both group and individual therapy. Since then, a lot of things from her past and childhood have resurfaced, and she's been working through them, which I have been supporting since day one.

But now, even the smallest things can set her off. She becomes extremely dysregulated pretty easily. I understand some of this, as she's been diagnosed with ADHD, and we've tried to put strategies in place to help her manage these moments. But the hardest part is how she interprets events, my actions, and even who she thinks I am during those times. It's like she builds a narrative about me that’s not even close to reality and defending myself feels like a losing battle.

 A couple of examples: About six months ago, we were driving back from a museum trip with our kids. I was on a steep two-lane road, behind a semi-truck. I didn’t want to get stuck behind it, so I safely switched lanes to pass. But the semi moved over too, cutting me off. I sighed and moved back to the right, and the semi cut me off again. I groaned in frustration.

This triggered my wife. She suddenly said, “Why are you driving so recklessly and putting our lives at risk?!” I was stunned. I hadn’t sped, I used my blinkers, and I only changed lanes twice. But she insisted I was “swerving in and out of traffic,” and claimed I was being dangerous.

I calmly tried to explain what really happened, but she wouldn’t hear it. She doubled down, even contradicting herself about what she claimed to have seen. After about 30 minutes of this back and forth, she cooled down. I asked her what had just happened, and all she said was that she felt “triggered,” “unsafe,” and “got defensive.” When I brought up how her version of events didn’t match reality, and how painful it is to have her see me that way, she just shrugged and said, “That’s how I felt.” and even admitted she really wasn't paying that much attention in the first place.

It's this pattern that's breaking me. Her interpretations of what I say or do in these moments are often the *worst possible version* of me. And it’s hard, really hard, not to defend myself against this imaginary villain she paints me to be.

Just last night, for instance, she asked me to help our kid with homework. I said “okay” and was helping. She overheard something she thought was incorrect and jumped in. I told her not to worry, that I had it covered. That triggered her again. She accused me of silencing her and “weaponizing incompetence” to get out of helping, like I was deliberately doing it wrong so she’d take over.

That stung. I wasn’t trying to manipulate her or avoid responsibility. I tried to explain this, but she wouldn’t hear it. She just kept saying, “I call it like I see it.” We fought for over an hour.

I’m emotionally exhausted. I don’t know how to keep sitting in these moments where I feel like a punching bag for a distorted version of me that I don’t even recognize. How do I validate someone’s feelings when the events didn’t happen the way they think they did? How do I keep showing up when she insists I’m someone I’m not, when I’ve told her over and over again that I love her and don’t think she’s any of the things she accuses me of?

I don’t know how much longer I can take these character assassinations and painful misinterpretations.

Any advice or insight would help.

**TL;DR:**  
In the past couple of years, since starting therapy, my wife has been getting triggered easily, usually into “fight” mode, especially with me and our kids. She’s been diagnosed with ADHD and is working through past trauma, but in her dysregulated moments, she misinterprets things I do or say in the worst possible way, accuses me of things that didn’t happen, and insists her feelings justify her version of events. I feel emotionally beat down and unsure how much longer I can take being treated like someone I’m not.",478,0.91,478,0,530.0,52.0,87,1757101867.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1n9f5gk/how_do_i_navigate_my_wifes_fightorflight_moments/,False,True
1k3qgkj,relationships,Husband is disappointed/sad that spending time together makes me happy,"The Tl:Dr of my relationship is: 
- husband and I have been together almost 9 years, married for 2.5
- we’re both around 30 y/o
- had our baby ~14 months ago, the pregnancy was a surprise birth control failure but we both wanted kids and were happy
- we had discussed ethical non-monogamy in the past, but put the discussion on hold during pregnancy
- after I gave birth my husband brought it up again and started really pushing for polyamory
- he also took on extra work as I had to stay home due to daycare costs eating up more than my monthly paycheck would cover
- he started pushing me off on his family and wouldn’t ever be home to help me or give me a break. He told me to go to his mom for a break, and all he was good for was bringing home money
- throughout all of postpartum he’s basically insinuated if not outright said that he doesn’t want me to rely on him or want him around
- at 6 months postpartum he pushed for us to open our relationship.. I hated it, he was disappointed when we closed it after a month.
- I also went back to school full time at this time and have maintained a 4.0 since
- we’ve been in couples therapy for about 5/6 months now. We each have our own therapists too.
- baby was also EBF and I still nurse her 2-3 times a day and plan to do so until at least 18 months or so


Alright, so that’s the background.

Now we’re in therapy, and I thought it was working. The last few weeks he’s worked less and made time to hang out with me and our baby more. He’s planned outings for us, taken us for bike rides, been home to cook dinner and do chores, and to watch the baby/toddler so I can have some me time or some friend time. It’s been so nice, and I mentioned to him that it made me happy, and thanked him for doing all this and making progress like we’ve talked about in therapy.

On our walk this morning (and in our last therapy session) he said it made him disappointed that I was so happy with spending all the time together. He said he noticed that since he didn’t spend so much time doing extra work (he’d normally work 60+h/week but cut it down to closer to 50h/week) and hanging out with us more at home that I’d been happier, and that it just proved to him that he was the problem. He said that everything he wants is a problem, and when he doesn’t do or get what he wants then I’m happy. He said he’s happy spending time with me and our baby, but he’s disappointed too.

Idk what to even think of this. I’m just hurt that I’ve dedicated so much time and energy to this relationship, to raising our baby (who is absolutely incredible), and that I’ve been told I shouldn’t be asking more of him, and that when we do spend time together he might be happy in the moment, but seems to look ack at it with regret and disappointment. Idk if he’s even happy to be with me. It doesn’t feel like it. It feels like he sees our relationship as holding him back, but when I try to tell him this he just says it feels like I don’t trust him. He says that lack of trust makes him not want to try. I tell him I’m trying to trust him, but he keeps doing this same pattern of spending time with us and then pulling away and then the cycle repeats. I don’t want him to pull back away, I don’t want him to tell me I shouldn’t need him. That’s when I can start trusting him again. Right now i’m always waiting for him to stop engaging with me and to just always be away.

He struggles a lot with negative self talk and negative self image, so I try not to say negative things when describing what I want out of our relationship, or how I’m hurt. But then he just puts words in my mouth, feels self pity, shuts down and stops talking to me for a day or more.

What do I do from here? How do I even address this? What do I say to our therapist?

Tl:Dr
My husband is disappointed that spending more time with me and our toddler makes me happier in our relationship, and he can’t just do whatever he wants and have me be fine with it.

It's been draining on my wife (F36), especially, but also our two kids (M3,F6) (they are WILD when guests are here) and they don't sleep well

My brother just asked if he could stay and his two kids (M5,F7) for a few days in February and my wife is freaking out, saying things like ""why do they always bother us!?"", ""why can't you just say no?!"", etc.

Honestly, I don't want guests, especially kids, staying with us. Last time they were here, their kids ran upstairs and were jumping on our master BR bed, playing with our new blinds, getting food everywhere, turning the living room into a jungle gym, etc.

So my wife is 100% against, and myself, I'd be willing to bite the bullet for a couple days just to keep the peace, but I'd rather them not come.

How do I politely let him down? I was thinking about saying something like, ""Would it be possible for you to just get a hotel? The kids go crazy and can't handle guests. They also don't sleep when people stay with us""

1hhzyrb,relationships,Fiancé won’t budge on his family Christmas traditions to work with mine ,"My fiancé (M, 28) and I (F, 29) have been together for 3.5 years. I grew up in a family with 4 kids and my parents have been married for 34 years. Our extended family is really small (I only have 4 younger cousins) and lives back home on the east coast where I’m from. So I was used to doing Christmas just the 6 of us (my parents and siblings) for the majority of my life. Some of my best memories are just relaxing at home with them, eating my mom’s amazing food, watching movies, and opening gifts. We would also get dressed up and go to church on Christmas morning. My parents don’t drink either, so for me family time has never involved alcohol, unlike my fiancé’s family. 

My fiancé only has one sibling and his parents are divorced but still good friends. He has four cousins on his mom’s side, and they all have significant others, so it’s about 20 of us. Every Christmas Eve their tradition is to get together at one of their homes in the early afternoon and they do an Italian feast and drink a lot and play games. These parties will literally last until 2 or 3 AM., which leaves no room to do anything else for the night of Christmas Eve, which is not what I like. My fiancé and I have spent every Christmas Eve since we’ve been together with his mom’s side for that party, because what he prefers for holidays is being surrounded by his family and partying with them. This has always seemed like a touchy subject I have tried to not complain about because I know it makes him happy so I just go along with it. So far our plan is to still attend the party this year on Christmas Eve. 

On Christmas Day, the past few years we have opened gifts with his mom in the morning, then gone to his dad’s side to celebrate with them and open gifts. My parents moved out of town about 1.5 years ago, so we aren’t even able to do anything with them for Christmas unless they’re in town. 

In my ideal world, my fiancé and I would only go to his mom’s side’s Christmas Eve for dinner for a few hours and then leave and do our own little traditions. On Christmas Day this year, we were originally going to travel to New York to see my family, but ultimately decided to stay in town and save money on traveling. So my alternative was he and I could spend all of Christmas Day together just us, since we would be with HIS family for most of Christmas Eve. It’s our first Christmas in our new house and first Christmas being engaged. I wanted to at least have some special time for us as a couple for Christmas because it’s my favorite holiday. And relaxing at home opening gifts, eating good food, watching Christmas movies… it may not sound like much but I love it. 

My fiancé originally sounded excited at the idea of us doing that together, but he is now telling me that that would be “boring” and doesn’t sound fun to him to “sit around at home all day when we have the whole week off of work to have alone time”. He also said that my family christmases sound lame and at his family’s they “actually have fun”. I took that personally because I would HOPE that my fiancé would be excited to spend Christmas Day with just me and try to create our own traditions, and having alcohol/partying involved shouldn’t be the determining factor for “fun”. 

I pointed out that I’ve already made a lot of sacrifices with my preferred holiday traditions in order to appease him, and he said he didn’t care. That made me even more upset. 

Sorry this post if so long, TLDR I’m just asking for some neutral advice because my family doesn’t live here anymore and I only have one friend in the area so I’m not sure how to handle this.

1o4dgki,relationships,"I (28M) want to break up, but my girlfriend's (29F) mother just died","I (28M) have been dating my girlfriend (29F) for about four years now. I love and care about her a lot, and our relationship has been great for the most part. However, over the last year or so I've really started to think critically about my future, and I'm not sure that we're compatible in the long term. 

Although they were once aligned, our opinions on children have started to diverge as we've neared our 30s (I'm leaning more towards wanting them, she's leaned away). She also has a ton of insecurities, and is probably clinically depressed, and I've needed to take more and more of my time and energy over the year or two support her, which has really started to take a toll. On top of all of that, she really doesn't know what she wants to do with her life and has no clear plans for the future, whereas I'm very career-oriented.

A few weeks ago I left for a several-month work trip to another state a few hours away from where we lived, and I was shocked by the fact that not seeing her every day almost felt like it lightened my load more than being an emotional burden. I decided recently that I need to end things, and I think it's going to shatter her. She relies a lot on me both emotionally and financially, and I don't know what her life would look like solo.

Then, last night, her mother (who she was very close with) suddenly died of a stroke. My GF has had a really horrible year, in terms of some of her friendships ending and a significant career setback, and I'm afraid that with everything else, this will break her. I want to help and support her, and I want to be there for her, but I also don't know if staying just to end the relationship soon after would be cruel. How long should I stay with her? How do I do what I know I need to in the least horrible way possible?

TL;DR: I want to break up with my GF, but her mom just died and she's in a very vulnerable place. How do I navigate this situation?

Edit: I guess I should have been clearer: I'm not going to break up with her right now, when she's in such an awful place. I just want to know how to navigate a situation where I cannot break up with her while she's going through this intense thing, even though I know the relationship is most likely over.

Also, I've been trying to get her into therapy for years, but she doesn't believe in its efficacy, and she's not willing to try.",450,0.94,450,0,481.0,31.0,47,1760235535.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o4dgki/i_28m_want_to_break_up_but_my_girlfriends_29f/,False,True
1i8ezzs,relationships,"I’m not happy in my marriage anymore, and I’m not sure if this is just a rough patch or if I should just call it quits","For starters, I’ve (31F) been with my husband (33M) for a total of over 11 years, married for 4. We’ve had a great relationship, the guy is literally my best friend and soulmate. But lately I’ve been finding myself to be rather unhappy. 

Backstory; not too long ago I found out he had downloaded a dating app while he was away on a work trip, but he swore left and right that he didn’t do anything. After almost a week of arguing and contemplating divorce, I chose to believe him (maybe a mistake on my part, but he seemed sincere, don’t judge me ;-; ) and we decided to try to work things out. 

What bothered me though is that he started acting like literally NOTHING happened, so I brought this up to him. Like I wasn’t expecting him to be groveling at my feet begging for me trust him right away, but I would’ve at least liked to see him put some effort or SOMETHING. And he heard me out and really has been trying ever since, and I see his efforts. But for some reason, I just get upset at any little thing he does, even the littlest white lie. 

I think the straw that broke the camel’s back happened yesterday. He went to the grocery store while I was at work and he texted me telling me he got me a snack and that made me happy. So when I got home, he excitedly have me a chocolate that he knows I like and I was like yay, thanks! And then I asked him what he got at the store, since we just went grocery shopping this past weekend and he told me what he got and then he said he got himself a snack too. So I was like cool, what did you get? And he said “oh, I got myself chips” and proceeds to show me two family-size bags of chips. At that moment, I was somewhat bothered, but was like okay, cool I guess.

Later on, I was going through junk mail and then see a carton of ice cream in the trash can. And it was truly then that I realized I was unhappy. Why? Because this man lied to me. I know it’s stupid, I really do. Like why am I getting upset over a pint of ice cream? I then go ask my husband again what he bought at the store and he lists the same things from earlier, and I ask him, “is that all?” And then he confesses to the ice cream.

Even as I write this I feel extremely stupid for getting upset over ice cream, but I feel like after the whole dating app situation, what else is he lying to me about, or will lie to me about? And with a straight face. 

Is this just a rough patch we’re going through? Or what is this? Anyone that has gone through a rough patch with their significant other, did you get past it, or when did you know to call it quits? 

TL;DR my husband lied about buying ice cream and made me question what else he has lied to me about, all after we decided to work things out after I found out he downloaded a dating app last year  ",452,0.95,452,0,477.0,25.0,96,1737668781.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i8ezzs/im_not_happy_in_my_marriage_anymore_and_im_not/,False,True

Fast forward 13 years and we don’t talk much or have as much in common. I do my thing, he does his (mostly sedentary).  Yes, I know our age difference is vast. I had a therapist for about 5 minutes who said “well, this is what you signed up for”. I know. Now. No need to reiterate that for me. I get to do some things I want to do; lunch with girlfriends, shopping, hiking. He’s doing what he wants to do and is able to due to health limitations. We talk about things to do together, but now we don’t care for each other’s interests. For the most part I’m ok with together-but-separate, until I get around other people with normal marriages. Comparison is the thief of joy. We don’t really socialize much with other couples. I feel pretty much alone which is not all bad. Lots of ambivalence. I do love him and he adores me. I don’t want a divorce. If we go to couple’s counseling, I’m afraid everything will unravel because there’s a lot I suppress that I don’t want to hurt his feelings with. And it will. I guess just looking for other’s viewpoints and/or suggestions. Please be kind.

1on7lk9,relationships,My boyfriend (33M) keeps saying “Have fun on your date” whenever I (32F) leave the house — how do I get him to stop?,"Almost every time I leave the house, my boyfriend says something like “Have fun on your date.” Sometimes he’ll even text it to me after I’ve gone.

There’s absolutely no reason for him to think I’d be seeing anyone else. Nothing’s ever happened that would make him suspicious — he just says these things out of nowhere. I find it really disrespectful and gross. I’ve never cheated, never given him a reason to doubt me, and I don’t even have anyone else in my life I could “go on a date” with.

We’ve lived together almost the entire year we’ve been dating. He didn’t used to say things like this, but now he’s constantly making passive-aggressive comments if I’m on my phone, like:

“If you want to talk to someone else, just do it.”
“You don’t have to hide that you’re talking to another guy.”

I’ve told him many times how offensive and damaging these comments are, but he doesn’t care — he seems to truly believe that what he is doing is somehow harmless.   I feel my respect for him slipping every time he does it. I’m honestly at the point where, if we didn’t live together, I’d already have broken up with him. Unfortunately, it is not going to be easy to separate from him at this point or for awhile due to financial reasons.

How should I handle this behavior when he refuses to take it seriously?

Also, how can I articulate the reason why this feels so gross ? I am struggling to find the words.

1np75z7,relationships,UPDATE: Wife messaging ex-boyfriend,"Update to [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mvaxf8/wife\_messaging\_exboyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mvaxf8/wife_messaging_exboyfriend/)

(I’ve (m43) been married to my wife (f41) for 15 years, known her for 17 years. For the most part they have been happy and we’ve got on really well.)

Thank you to everyone who commented. We had a few chats in the week after the original post about the situation. I explained how her going behind my back plus dwelling on this past relationship made me feel.

She had said if I didn't want her to speak to him anymore, she wouldn't - I was adamant that this wasn't my call to make. She eventually said that she wouldn't speak to him anymore and that she was naïve to think that her and her ex could still be friends. As far as I was aware, she let him know that she wouldn't be in contact anymore because of me and he was accepting of this (I haven't seen any of their messages nor have I asked to).

A week later my mother passed away so a pin was stuck in any conversations between us but about a week ago we had a good chat in which I felt heard, mostly centring around me creating a larger social life outside the home and how we've become co-dependent on each other. I said that my trust in her has been eroded which upset her a little but she understood. We seemed to be getting back on track and I was open about my insecurities, and what I needed to work on.

Unfortunately a few days later, she seemed distracted and when I asked her what was wrong, she said she'd tell me later when the kids are in bed. This was dragged out all day and then she admitted that she was still in contact with her ex for a couple of weeks and wants to meet him for coffee. I asked what would happen if he made a move, and she said she'd be ""disappointed"". I also asked about his wife, and apparently he's separated (which she knew about before but didn't tell me). He's embarking on a new career and was asking her for advice, to which I questioned was there not anyone else in his life that could provide career advice. She also says he's had a cancer scare which also prompted her to get in touch with him again.

It's her call who she meets up with but I told her the lying has to stop. She claims it's so she doesn't hurt me but it's caused more damage by lying. She admitted that making me decide about her not talking to him anymore was ""poor"" but that I don't understand the depth of feeling that existed between them.

I don't know what to say to her and have started investigating what steps to take legally to protect myself. I'm so angry and sad, that at best, she is sacrificing a 15-year marriage to be friends with an ex she hasn't seen in 20 years, and at worst, will get back with him. Our relationship has been tarnished with lies and omissions of the truth, and I'm done.

1jefjhu,relationships,HELP: I (26F) think my boyfriend (30M) is exaggerating or faking his illness,"Saw someone's post yesterday about navigating life with a partner who has fibromyalgia and felt inspired to post here! I'm hoping y'all can give me some solid advice.

I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for a little under two years. In the time we've been together his chronic pain (which isn't connected to any particular/known condition as he refuses to go to the doctor) has gotten worse and worse. It's reached a point where he's almost incapable of doing chores or house projects, is usually too exhausted/in pain to make or agree to plans and getting him to do anything outside of the house together is like pulling teeth. His objections always revolve around his pain and fatigue. I've never suffered from chronic pain (and thank god), so I'm not one to judge or accuse someone of ""making it up"" since the pain itself is invisible and my boyfriend looks perfectly healthy, but he's now been unemployed for about 4 months and I'm starting to question things.

I'm starting to feel doubtful for a number of reasons, and the main ones are that a) he never turns down his friend's invitations to hang out, even when the activity is something physically intense like kayaking, or going hiking, or going to a music festival and b) he is never too tired/in too much pain to have sex. Over time it's almost made it seem like he's conveniently in an unbearable amount of pain when he has to do something he isn't all that interested in (i.e. chores) and I'm starting to feel hurt that he just...doesn't seem to want to hang out with me outside of what we do lazing around the house?

I've never accused him of faking or exaggerating his pain, but I have tried to talk to him about doing more fun stuff together, and it always circles back to his pain or him accusing me of trying to keep him from spending time with his friends (which I'm not trying to do by any means). I've done a ton of research into autoimmune disorders and other conditions that could be causing his problem, always bringing my findings and suggestions to him, but he just doesn't believe a doctor or any traditional medicine will help him. I'm also bothered because when we go to family outings or parties that we're both invited to (it's rare, but it does happen), he will talk anyone who will listen's ear off about how bad his chronic pain is and how frustrating it is to not be able to find a solution. The thing is, he's not actually looking for a solution. He just smokes weed every day and calls that good enough while lamenting and complaining that his body is the way that it is. He also refuses to return to work because of his pain. (For additional context: he seems to have really extreme muscle spasms/tightness, particularly in his back). I'm happy to support him through hard times, but the fact that he won't work is getting concerning and I feel severely stuck. I'm not interested in supporting him financially on a long-standing basis, but at the moment I partially am by covering some of his expenses.

If this post makes me a total asshole for questioning the degree of my boyfriend's chronic pain, so be it. I just need help and answers.

So, here are my question(s): Where do I go from here? Do you think it's possible that my boyfriend is using his pain as a crutch? Should I put some kind of ultimatum in place that will get him medical care/attention? Your advice is appreciated!

TLDR: My (26F) boyfriend's (30M) chronic pain is highly questionable and I'm not sure how I can motivate him to get better.

I'm 21 and a college student. It's the middle of the night and my friend (F21) posted pictures of her baby shower, which was at 1 p.m.

When I saw them I panicked, she invited me and I confirmed that I would go, but for some reason in my mind, the date was March 4th, not the 2nd. I wrote to her almost immediately, apologizing for not going, assuring her that it was not my intention and asking if I could visit her another day to make up for my absence, she has not responded.

She didn't text me, she didn't ask me where I was or if I was coming, nothing. I know I have no right to claim anything from her, because the mistake was mine. But I can't help but feel hurt.

We were both best friends in high school, but now, I don't even know what her favorite color or food is. After we entered different universities, we started to grow apart, there were no fights, we just at some point stopped talking to each other about everything or looking for each other.

I feel like if there was any chance of maintaining this friendship, I just threw it out the window. And I feel terrible.

1ihnqgn,relationships,Found torn condom wrapper in bed - not sure what to make of it,"I (44F) found a torn piece of a condom wrapper when getting into bed last night with my husband (41M). It was the top of a wrapper. We have not been intimate in....well, awhile (we have our other issues). I have no reason to believe he would be cheating since that is just not his nature and he has never cheated on anyone in the past. On top of that, I just can't imagine either of us has the time to cheat even if we wanted to because we have two young kids and run a business together. I am trying to think of innocent reasons for it, but the only two I can come up with I am just not sure make sense - (1) making balloons in bed or (2) maybe using it to masturbate and not have a mess in bed?

The same pack of 4-6 condoms that were in his drawer forever are now down to two and the wrapper I found in bed was one of those I am pretty sure. I am mostly curious if that is even a thing - do guys use condoms to masturbate and not have as much of a mess after? He tends to do that in the shower for that reason. The only other explanations are obvious and I can accept that if that is the case. Not sure how to approach this without coming across like I do not trust him, since I have always trusted him and still do.

Also, it only kinda sorta bothered me finding it. We are definitely in a marital slump/dealing with the hardest times in our marriage so far. We have been together 10 years.

1lomskv,relationships,Update: he sent me an engagement ring in the mail,"TL;DR! - I broke up with my partner after a year and a half and requested no contact, his last effort is sending me an engagement ring in the mail. 

This is the link to the post I put up a week ago. I’m truly grateful for all the advice and it helped motivate me to end things. Now my only concern is handling this last Hail Mary from him correctly: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/mn9UBpI1Qu

I ended things Sunday before last. Over a simple text summarizing the issues I had and why they were the baseline of me wanting to end things and move forward. I had to resort to the text because he kept pretending I didn’t break up over the phone. I requested we don’t speak anymore and he responded with a short and simple text saying he had no choice but to honor my decision and it was a “disappointment” but he wished me the best. He actually finally said “I’m sorry.” At the very end which was unbelievable.

Friday I get a box in the mail with some clothes I forgot at his apartment and as I’m going through it I saw a little gift bag. I open it and there’s a ring that was clearly wrapped in a gift shop and a manically scribbled note: “I was going to give you this in New Mexico (our last planned trip together) it’s yours and always will be so I hope you like it.” Followed by scribbled out hearts and his name. 

I know this was my engagement ring because he spoke about wanting to buy me one when he took a trip to New Mexico back in January. It’s so close to what he described as being what he saw “speaking to us” I know that it is. Even looking back and realizing his version of my engagement ring was not what I cared for spoke volumes. 

I know the note is vague for a reason, I know this is his last way to get back at me for the breakup. In turn, I built this man a custom cabinet (talking about 60 plus hours of work) that I never plan to send to him. It feels manipulative and mean and I really just want to handle this in a way that’s appropriate and doesn’t open a window for discussion. Do I just silently keep it, pawn it off? I can’t stand looking at it. My friend suggested just mailing it back as is, note left in it and all. so there is no way he can say he did it. Not sure what to do.

1jz5zo3,relationships,Merged households and now my mother (76f) is ruining our health and relationship.,"My (36f) fiancé (35m) and I have been together for 5 years. We were about to welcome our 2nd child in 2024 and living in a 2 bedroom apartment with our child and my teen daughter from my first marriage. My mother (76f) had to sell her house fast and wouldn't be able to afford the mortgage of a new place on her own right away. So we decided move in to a large home together. Her name is on it and we just pay her monthly. The plan is for us to just pay her $1000 a month plus splitting utilities until we get married. Then we'd take a loan out and buy her out for $150,000. The worry is, once we have the loan we don't know how long it will take her to move out. She wants to move to a small condo or apartment with little upkeep.

Living with her is HELL. She'd demanding we pay for half of a fence installation we never agreed on. She's constantly screaming at my children for making messes (normal kid things), chasing the cats for just getting behind furniture, and yelling at me when I don't pick up clothes off OUR bathroom floor immediately. I'm worried about the impact her anger and constant yelling is having on the kids. It certainly stresses my fiancé out when he gets home from work and sees a to-do list for all of us sitting out. My breaking point had to be a few weeks ago when she SLAPPED my 2.5 year old in the face for biting her (after she grabbed him hard and yelled at him for running). I've been having health issues ever since then. Chest and stomach pains and headaches. They always seem to elevate when she's around.

I'm more motivated than ever to get married and ask her to move, but now she's telling us that she's trying to ""sort things out"" before we take out the loan. Our stress is through the roof and at this point we want to move out and leave her high and dry. She keeps getting worse. Everything makes her angry. The house is clean. Her idea of messy or dirty is a shirt on the floor or a snack being left out for more than 5 minutes.

I've been to the ER 2x in the past 3 months because my stress levels around her get so bad I think I'm having a heart attack. I've developed Stomach Ulcers and a Hiatal Hernia since living here. It's a waking nightmare. I want to go to the courthouse and just get married then walk straight to the bank and get a loan for a different house.

TL;DR Living with my 3 kids and fiancé at my mothers new house to help her with bills and eventually buy her out.

She was very abusive towards me for the first 3 years of our relationship until her health basically took her strength to keep fighting, however throughout I maintained that I knew where it came from and saw past it and never once blamed her. I've since changed my point of view - I don't think she has any interest in making her own efforts to change. She simply bottles up the delusions she has created of me now and it's boiled into clear resentment because she won't do anything about them yet doesn't have the strength to be abusive anymore.

She just lays in bed with me working full time to fund our life and take care of her. I've now reached point of bitterness.

I have ADHD, I understand its hard - I never sleep well because of it, I'm always tired, and yet I get up and do things because it's life, you can't just expect someone to carry you around for your whole life. 

I work with people with ME and Autism, they attend work events, do things with partners, go on holidays etc and have all agreed that ""you just got to do it or it consumes you"" (for clarity, I don't shit talk my partner - I've simply detailed her struggles as she has agreed is appropriate)

I spent 6 years homeless in my early 20s - I'm losing more and more years of my life but am completely held back. And yet despite saying that in the anonymity of reddit - I can't abandon her. She has no living family, she's found reasons to cut off her friends because she is so vindictive as to be incapable of forgiving someone simply forgetting to say ""happy birthday"" until a day later.

I saw her, real her when we started dating, before she sunk into her delusions, fears and paranoias. I loved that girl, but who she is now has taken her away. I love her, I want her to be okay, but she isn't 'her' anymore. And yet I have no way out beyond kicking her to the streets which I can't do having lived that life myself.

She is always the victim, but is actually incredibly strong, funny, talented, loving - she just won't *let* herself be those things. Everyone in her life tiptoed around her before she cut them out for the smallest 'disrespect'.

Growing up, I thought he was brilliant — but I now see he never considered anyone else’s opinion, argued endlessly and philosophically, never reached resolutions, and often discredited me or my mom.

He was diagnosed around age 70 with Schizotypal Personality Disorder and Hemicrania Continua. I try to take that into account, but his behavior has gotten worse over time.

I have been living abroad for the past 4 years, and I regularly visit. I was visiting him for a few days this month. During one of his never-ending “talks,” I told him I think he behaves like a victimist narcissist, because he reframes everything so he’s the victim, discredits my feelings, and never takes responsibility. He did exactly that: he denied everything, accused me of being the narcissistic and victimistic one, and discredited my own experience of having lived 26 years with him, which led me to identify that pattern and express that to him with examples. He was not happy about what I said, but I eventually had to cut the conversation off because I had other commitments.

Later that day, after I finished my commitments, he came to my room and insisted we continue talking. I refused and tried to leave. He blocked the door, grabbed my arms, and started screaming. His face and eyes looked almost possessed. He wouldn’t let go. I screamed at him to release me, but he held on tighter. For the first time in my life, I was genuinely afraid of him and feared for my life.

I have never been in a fight before, and the first fight of my life was with my own dad. The one person who was supposed to protect and support me was instead the person making me fear for my safety.

I tried to get free without hurting him, but he ended up stepping on something and fell. I helped him up, hoping it would calm him, but it didn’t. I attempted to pack while he kept grabbing me. Finally, in panic, I see his arm reaching my neck, and I bit him and pushed just enough to break free. I ran out the door and as far as I could before stopping.

Later, he called my cousin (30F), saying my mom and I were “against him,” conveniently leaving out that he physically restrained me.

The next morning, I returned with my older cousin (51F) and uncle (80M) to collect my things. When I walked in, the same arms and nails that had dug into my skin the day before were now reaching out to hug me. He acted loving, like nothing had happened. I said “no” firmly, which he immediately used against me by telling my uncle, ""Do you see how she is with me?"". He followed me around, tried to block me again, but I stayed focused on leaving. If my relatives hadn’t been there, I believe he would have tried to stop me again.

It’s been almost two weeks. I’ve blocked him. I don’t think an apology would be sincere, and I’m scared of what he might say if we speak again. I’m planning to start therapy to process this, but I would appreciate advice or experiences from anyone who has been through something similar.

TL;DR: My dad (73M), who has a personality disorder, blocked me from leaving during an argument, grabbed my arms, and raised his arm toward my neck. I panicked, bit him, and escaped. The next day, I collected my things with family present while he acted as though nothing had happened — even trying to hug me with the same arms that had restrained me. I’ve blocked him and am planning to see a therapist. I don’t know if I should ever have contact with him again.",407,0.96,407,0,425.0,18.0,38,1758135319.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1njlwvf/my_30f_dad_73m_physically_restrained_me_during_an/,False,True
1mlk6bl,relationships,"My (49M) sister (43F) keeps on telling people that we grew up in an abusive home. This is not true and it pisses me off when she says it, especially in front of my kids.","We both had a relatively okay upbringing. Our parents were a bit old school (mom was dominican, dad was arab-dominican... go figure) but they didn't hit us, and they weren't super restrictive about dating or hanging out with friends. We grew up in a working class area in brooklyn, mostly irish/italian with some puerto rican and dominican. The worst I can say about our parents is that they made us do chores and made us have 'lessons' where they went out of their way to force us how to learn how to do stuff. Like change a tire and fix a broken toilet, stuff like that. 

My sister always makes it out to people as if we grew up in some absolute hell hole. On social media mostly (where she makes it a big part of her 'brand'), but also in real life, right in front of me, she has told people that our parents were abusive, that they were involved in 'organized crime'. She loves saying that exact last part, word for word.

We had some sketchy uncles and cousins, and our dad definitely hung out with sketchy people, but at no point was anyone in our immediate family 'involved in organized crime' like that. 

Also, it especially frustrates me when she talks about our family being 'abusive'. My parents were way harder on the boys than the girls (3 boys, 2 girls). They were especially harder on the older siblings, aka me and my brother and older sister, whereas she came later when they were way more lenient and calm. 

Its fairly obvious to me that she is saying these things to come off like she is a more 'interesting' person. She hangs out with a lot of well-off sheltered manhattan people, and every single time I am with them it feels like she goes out of her way to 'show off' how crazy her upbringing was. 

Its one thing to do it in front of friends, but she recently started saying this shit in front of our neighbors, when my kids were around. We live on the same block, so we have a ton of mutual friends in terms of neighbors, and for her to say that shit in front of my kids? I dont want my kids thinking that. I also just dont want people thinking im some kind of 'abused' person or that I went through some horrific trauma in my childhood. 

I want to confront her, but I dont even know how. Its such an awkward subject to breach. I feel like she will deny it and just use semi-truths (like our sketchy cousins or our parents being kinda-traditional) to try and make it out as if her hyperbolic bullshit is real. And I know some people will say ""shes much younger than you, maybe she had a different experience"" but I lived in the apartment below them, I was still living with them while she was a teen. She was very well-behaved, and they always loved her and treated her like some kind of star-child. 

What do I do? How do I bring this up to her? Should I even bring this up to her?

Tl;DR - - my sister always makes our upbringing out to be some kind of abusive, insane upbringing. In reality it was nothing like how she describes.",413,0.82,413,0,529.0,116.0,77,1754727095.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mlk6bl/my_49m_sister_43f_keeps_on_telling_people_that_we/,False,True

My boyfriend has been pretty good at being there for me since all of this happened but these past 2 weeks I've been feeling extra depressed so I've been sleeping a lot more/staying in the bedroom. Boyfriend first started saying that it seems like I don't like him anymore but I told him I was just feeling extra down. Now he's saying he thinks I'm getting distant so I can break up with him and that I'm withholding affection from him and that I'm being cruel. No matter what I tell him it doesn't feel like the answer is good enough. I still feel so lost without my mom here and can't ask advice from her anymore, what do I do? 😭 he genuinely acts like he doesn't understand why I'm so upset over my mother, everyday he gets more and more upset with me.

1kr6nv2,relationships,(26) Is it toxic of my boyfriend (M27) to expect me to be with him every weekend and compensate him later if I don't go?,"(26) My boyfriend (M27) and I have been dating for about 3 years and a half. The Dynamic is I go to his home on the Friday until Monday morning when I have to go back to work. He lives very far away from my workplace so I just stay at my mom's.

I was planning on moving in with him, but after an argument, I decided otherwise.

We had previous discussions about how financially draining it is to be with him, since he doesn't work so everything we decide to buy or eat comes from my salary, sometimes my entire weekly salary is spent on the weekend with him and if I tell him ""we won't buy anything else because I need the money"" he gets moody.

This weekend I got some financial help and some extra money, I decided to not go to his house. But is never that easy. I had to go to do something important on sunday, so I used it as an excuse to be there, and when he offered to bring me and take me on his car, I said I was busy friday evening and on saturday and that it was better for me to stay.

On saturday evening I went to a friend's house and we spent a girl's night together, I didn't tell him because I know he would say that I'm choosing someone else over him, he also got all moody with his constant texts. ""I need you, wanna sleep with you (not in the sexual sense, just sleep) the dog missed you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I want us to make dinner together"" etc etc. This is normal for him, during the work week he texts me the same until I can go to his place.

I kinda feel mentally drained and the weekend was great to rest but of course is the expectation to compensate him for the weekend that I wasn't with him and because of his constant texting I don't feel like I had a proper rest from him.

Is this toxic? or am I just complaining too much? How can I handle it to have time for myself without feeling like I'm getting into time together debt with him?

TLDR: I've been dating my boyfriend for over three years, usually spending weekends at his place. I had planned to move in, but after an argument and ongoing financial draining, since he doesn’t work and I pay for a lot, I reconsidered. This weekend, I stayed home to rest instead of visiting him, though I had to find excuses to avoid confrontation. I spent Saturday night with a friend, which I kept from him to avoid guilt tripping. Despite my break, his constant texts made me feel drained rather than rested, and now there's pressure to make up for the time apart.",399,0.89,399,0,455.0,56.0,111,1747752303.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kr6nv2/26_is_it_toxic_of_my_boyfriend_m27_to_expect_me/,False,True

He just went on one last month leaving me (23F) with our baby, who was at the time 5 months old. Now 6 months old. We’ve been together 7 years, married for 1.5. His last trip, we argued the entire week leading up to the trip, I told him I didn’t want him to go but it was ultimately his decision because I don’t like being controlling. He went, and I honestly did fine being alone with the baby, but I have never gotten a break. I haven’t gotten to go on trips away from the baby, because I can’t. And I wouldn’t do that to him anyway knowing how hard and exhausting it is by yourself and with a farm. His friends are asking me to let him go and he’s been in a bad mood knowing I don’t want him to go. I just don’t know how to keep handling this. He’s going to keep wanting to go on these trips, then we’ll spend weeks fighting whether he goes or not, and I’m tired of arguing over the same things over and over. Do I just let him go and deal with stress of doing everything myself, keep my feelings hidden for weeks so we don’t fight, not get a break, so that he can go with his friends riding, drinking, and forget about all of his responsibilities? That just doesn’t seem like a solution I want and I keep questioning why I’m always the one compromising. Where he’s going doesn’t have service, so I can’t even really contact him.

1ildzbx,relationships,My (30M) mother wants to get a divorce and move into my new home,"So my fiance (31F) and I (30M) are in the process of buying a new home - we are weeks away from exchanging contracts. We live in the UK and house prices are extortionate so it's been hard saving up for our first place. As a result, we have spent the last year living with my parents, who are also generously gifting us £20k for the deposit. This has been difficult enough for me but it has been incredibly hard on my fiance. She works a very stressful job and doesn't feel she can truly unwind when she gets home. My parents laid back but they have their quirks. My mum will often cook on my fiance's off days despite knowing this is her biggest hobby and the thing she most loves to do to relax. She will often ask prying questions to know more about our relationship. My mother is Iranian and very family oriented but despite having conversations with her, she does struggle to set boundaries.

Anyway, last night my mum brought me over to talk about how she felt that she may want to have a divorce. Honestly, this probably should've happened well into my childhood but I thought, yeah that's reasonable. Right at the very end of the conversation, she states that she could then move in with us in the second room (which is to be my study as I do WFH days). I didn't react and tried to play it cool but I'm honestly losing my mind now.

I know this probably comes off as incredibly selfish. My parents have been very generous with the gift and letting us live here. I am 100% planning on paying back their deposit when I can (eg after selling this house) and would've always looked after my parents when they got older and needed more support. However, I now feel like this has been my mum's plan from the start. My fiancé has literally been counting down the days when she gets independence - she wasn't even keen on the idea of saving up by staying with my parents in the first place. I'm wondering whether we just ditch it all and rent instead, or move to a significantly cheaper city.

I haven't yet spoken to my fiance about this because she has already been feeling very low about her current living circumstances. Does anyone have any ideas on how to best handle this? Maybe how to broach the subject with her or how to prevent this from happening?

Tl;dr:

My fiancé and I are weeks away from our new first home. We have lived with parents for the last year rent free and they are contrubutimg to the deposit and now my mother states she wants to get a divorce and move into our second room/study. What do I do??

Thanks everyone for your responses - please keep them coming! I agree with almost every one of your answers.

Should I marry him?","I(25F) have been dating my boyfriend(24M) for 3 years now. He is disabled due to a genetical chronical disease name Duchenne Muscular Distrophy which paralyzes his body and made him fully wheelchair-bound at age 11. The life expectancy of people with this disease is from 20 to 30 years, and people with this condition die of respirstory issues. As you can see, my boyfriend's time is getting shorter. Due to my boyfriend's disease getting more awful, he has to use a ventilator to breathe, and he also uses now an electric.wheelchair to move around.

Despite ly boyfriend's disability, we hsve gone on many dates, and we've tried to have a normal relationship as possible.

I care about him a lot — he’s kind, thoughtful, intelligent, and an animal lover like me — but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s missing.

This is one of the healthiest relationships I’ve had in terms of consistency and stability. There’s no drama, no mind games. But there’s also no real passion or emotional intimacy. I haven’t been in many relationships, so maybe this is just how most of them are? Still, half a year in, I feel like there should be more emotional depth — real conversations about what moves us, inspires us, challenges us. Instead, it feels like we’re stuck on the surface.

I know my boyfriend’s favorite food and color, but I don’t know what truly drives him. I don’t know what keeps him up at night or lights him up inside. I wish I could be okay with staying in the shallow end, talking about errands and weather and work — but I crave depth. I want to talk about art, spirituality, inner worlds.

I’ve tried to initiate those conversations, but his responses are often short or vague, and I’m left carrying the weight of trying to connect.

TL;DR My relationships lacks depth. 

Am I asking for something unrealistic?

Boyfriend does nearly nothing around the house and despite promising to do better, nothings happened. And I don’t know what to do.


My boyfriend(M/27) and I(F/25) have been together for about 2 years. 4 months ago we moved in together. Before this my bf lived in a shared accommodation with two other guys. He was the neat freak, he cleaned a lot and was cool with cooking etc.
However I’m starting to think this was a fever dream of some sort.
He started a new course at university and it’s been stressing him out a lot. 
In the beginning I was cool to take over more of the housework because at that point we were actively moving and it was pretty tough to juggle it all.
The thing is, this never ended. In these four months he has done laundry maybe 3 times and cooked dinner maybe twice and grocery shopped once. 
I do ALL the cleaning. The laundry. The meal planning. The meal prepping. The dishes he does half the time, that’s the one chore we share.
I have brought this up multiple times. Because I am exhausted. I spend 8+ hours a week on maintaining our home, on top of my own full-time study and two student jobs. 
He just quit his because he’s stressed from his course, which I get, but it means almost all financial burden and household duties fall on me. He has completely abandoned me and whenever I bring it up, he acknowledges it, says he’ll do better and changes nothing.
I am at my wits end because I am furious with him all of the time. Like I am so angry and I can’t explain why and I feel like a horrible girlfriend and regret ever moving in with him.

1hm7dym,relationships,I [35F] just spent my first Christmas with my fiancé's [31F] family. How can I walk things back to doing holidays separately?,"Lila and I have been dating for two years, engaged and living together for one of them. She's extremely close with her family and we fly out to visit them probably 3-4 times per year at least. I've always really liked them (and from everything she and they have told me, they like me a lot too), but we come from very different backgrounds and after this first longer holiday visit I find myself feeling like I'm too uptight and high-maintenance to consistently do major holidays with them going forward.

For context: I grew up a big coastal city as part of a small and very type-A family, my brother is estranged and my mother passed away when I was in my teens so it's really just my dad and I now. Lila's family lives in the small rural town where she grew up, and she's the only one who's ever left the area; her brothers and sister all live within an hour's drive. They're  unpretentious and down-to-earth folks, which is in some ways a breath of fresh air compared to how I was raised, but I've realized that as terrible as this makes me sound...I kinda hit my limit with some aspects of it after about 3 nights (we're here for 8 this time).

There's obviously a lot to unpack as to why, but a few of the big reasons:

1. I'm very allergic to cats and they have four, one of which used to be Lila's until we moved in together. Even on the maximum dose of Claritin and two rounds of allergy shots I'm usually completely stuffed up and miserable after a couple days here, especially since their standards of clean are a lot more relaxed than mine. The obvious solution to this one would be ""stay in a hotel"", but we've tried that and all it did was quadruple the price of the trip and make Lila sad that we were missing out on some of the late-night family time. It didn't even help my allergies much because we ended up spending so much time over there during the day anyway (there's not a lot else to do in town, and they're big homebodies besides).

2. I'm a vegan, which they have a lot of trouble accommodating since they're absolutely ""meat and cheese in everything"" types. I try to eat some animal products while I'm here so as not to be a burden, but after so long they tend to really upset my stomach even in small quantities. I've tried offering to buy/prepare my own ingredients and meals but I can tell this rubs the family the wrong way, since food is a big love language for them. They try their best, they just really struggle with figuring out how to have options around for me, especially since it's easy to forget to check the ingredients on things like seasoning mixes and sauces.

3. Their biggest pastimes are watching (or talking about) sports and playing cards, neither of which I did much of growing up. I've made an effort to learn more about both over the past few years so I can participate, but I still have trouble keeping up. 

All in all, after about day 4 of this trip I found myself feeling like the villainous ""high-maintenance big-city fiancé who's clearly wrong for the sweet small-town main character and gets dumped halfway through the movie"" from every Hallmark Christmas film ever. Lila's family was (as always) extremely welcoming and kind to me, but I'm obviously still in my head.

And beyond all that, maybe the biggest thing is that this is the first Christmas where I've ""chosen"" a partner's family over spending the holiday with my dad, and it felt horrible. He put on a brave face about it, but each time I've talked with him this week I can tell how sad and lonely he is. The idea was originally to invite him to spend Christmas with Lila's family too starting next year, but my dad is even more of an uptight nerd than I am (he was an anesthesiologist and basically only knows how to interact with other introverted science-y types), and if I felt this out of place I can't imagine how much more uncomfortable he'd feel in this setting. And even though my family is so small compared to Lila's, the idea of never spending a Christmas in my family home again actually makes me really sad, more so than I expected it would.

All this to say, I'm trying to figure out how to pitch the idea of going back to doing Christmases separately to Lila, without sounding like a horrible snooty ingrate. I was considering suggesting alternating whose family we do Thanksgiving with, so that we still spend a major holiday with each other's families regularly, but just going to our respective hometowns at Christmas (we don't want children, so this wouldn't create a who-gets-to-see-the-grandkids issue in the future). But then again, how can I even bring this up when she's so close with them? Even today she was getting teary because she's sad we only have two days left before we leave, meanwhile I'm crawling up the walls. I just don't know how to approach this without making her and her family feel totally rejected, and I'm at a loss here.

Tl;dr my fiance's family are wonderful people, but staying with them for prolonged periods is a struggle for me and leaving my dad alone at Christmas is breaking my heart. How can I suggest that we go back to doing Christmas separately?",391,0.91,391,0,434.0,43.0,110,1735155511.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hm7dym/i_35f_just_spent_my_first_christmas_with_my/,False,True
1ot1ogh,relationships,My mom found out about my private life and says she’ll never forgive me. I don’t know what to do.,"I (27F) come from a conservative religious background.  I live abroad now, but recently something happened that completely broke my relationship with my mom (55F).

I gave her my old phone because hers stopped working. Before giving it away, I deleted WhatsApp, thinking all my private conversations were gone. Unfortunately, when she reinstalled it, all my old chats were restored — including some very personal messages and “flirty” conversations.

When she saw them, she was devastated and furious. She said I had brought shame, that I was no longer her daughter, and that she regretted giving birth to me. She blocked me, then unblocked me just to say hurtful things like calling me names. She even told me not to tell my relatives that we don't talk anymore, or she'd show them everything so they'd know the truth about me. 

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. She had warned me that if it happened again, she would cut me off — and this time, she did.

I feel destroyed inside. I keep blaming myself, but at the same time, I feel like her reaction is too extreme. I know what I did isn’t acceptable in her eyes, but it hurts to lose my mom like this.
I’m far from home, I feel ashamed and empty, and I don’t know how to move forward.

Has anyone else gone through something like this — especially in a strict religious family? How did you cope with losing your parent emotionally, even if they’re still alive?

EDIT : For context, these messages were related to my active sexual life, so she's hurting for knowing that I'm sexually active.

I feel like my life revolves around taking care of him and being available to him. Am I being taken advantage of or am I being ungrateful like he says I am? How do I get him to see how I feel without coming across as being ungrateful?

TL; DR - Should I be paying half the bills and doing the cleaning for a man who is only my boyfriend because it’s his mom’s house?

UPDATE : Discovered this morning (Christmas Eve) that he spent last night with a random woman he met at the bar in PA while working there. Immediately seeking rehousing.

1jvoxnj,relationships,A conversation with gf (31F) about my (34M) appearance has left me a little bit heartbroken and now I'm suffering in silence,"Around a year ago I started a fitness journey and began turning my life around health-wise after my marriage ended. I made some drastic improvements, built muscle, lost weight and have never been happier with how I look. I quickly gained confidence and I put myself back into the dating pool. 

I met an amazing, beautiful woman and we have been together for 6 months now. I am generally very secure with my appearance however I am a logical person and accept that she is much better looking than me which would also mean that she would have dated attractive guys before me. I tell her regularly how beautiful she is to me and I have told her that she is the most attractive person I have been with, she is very complimentary in return but rarely complements my appearance and when she does it is quite reserved and non specific.

As time has gone on she has started frequently making ""jokes"" about my appearance such as my height, my hair (I buzz cut my hair as I have started to recede a bit and think it looks better short) and most of all the size of my arms. She has also made unprompted comments about her usual type being a bigger build than me and has spoken about dating several bodybuilders in the past. She has also made some comments about having a history dating black guys. She has reassured me that our relationship is deeper than that and that she loves me for what I give her emotionally which she has never experienced before and until now that has been enough for me.

Last week we were talking about my circumcision which I had as an adult and she joked that I should have asked for them to make it bigger and darker as well. I made the mistake of asking if that was her preference and she smiled and looked away. I decided to drop it but it did bother me which she picked up on and later asked if she had upset me. This led to a conversation where she said that I am the only man she has ever loved but told me she wishes that I was taller, that I had hair and that my arms were bigger. She also implied that I am the least attractive person she has been with. 

I now feel deflated and more insecure than I ever was when I was out of shape, I have also become borderline obsessive with my diet and exercise. I trust her completely and appreciate her honesty with me but part of me wishes I didn't know how much she would change about me if she could.

I know I need to communicate this with her but I also know that a line has been crossed and no amount of talking will erase this knowledge or the feeling I had when she told me this. How do I go on in this situation?

Tldr: gf listed multiple things she dislikes about my appearance and implied I am the least attractive person she has dated",387,0.87,387,0,455.0,68.0,53,1744257167.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jvoxnj/a_conversation_with_gf_31f_about_my_34m/,False,True
1oqvjn0,relationships,"My, 40F, husband, 45M,been living with my dad for work. I think he’s cheating.","I, 40F, have been with my husband Brian (fake name), 45M, for almost two decades. We have four kids. A few years ago, we moved from our hometown, a major city, to a smaller, quiet town about three hours away in another state. At the time, we only had our two oldest children, and childcare wasn’t an issue.

Brian was able to find employment fairly quickly when we moved, and I worked from home full-time, which gave me the opportunity to care for our kids, the home, and our marriage. Things were great until I became pregnant with our now third child and developed some health issues.

Because Brian had to call out frequently due to my hospitalizations during the pregnancy, he was eventually forced to resign from his job due to attendance and performance. During delivery, there was an accident and my baby and I almost didn’t survive. The baby was in the NICU for months recovering. She is now a happy and mostly healthy baby. After she came home, Brian worked odd jobs to bring in money, but his primary concern was making sure the kids and I were okay.

A few days before our youngest turned 1, we found out that we were having our fourth and last child. That pregnancy was tough as well, but things went relatively okay until delivery. During the delivery, I was injured by my surgeon, which prevented me from caring for my newborn and our other kids. I was on bed rest for a few months recovering from the C-section and the injury.

Brian waited on me hand and foot and worked reduced hours. We lived off savings and my disability checks from my employer. My father also sent money to help us out. Once I recovered, I returned to work full-time, but Brian wasn’t able to find steady employment. We made things work for a while, but unexpected expenses in the home and with our taxes drove up our costs.

Eventually, Brian found a full-time job back in our home city; great pay, benefits, and room for overtime. My father offered to let him live with him so he wouldn’t have to commute six hours a day or pay any bills while there. Brian was hesitant to leave because I’d still been dealing with health issues since our last child, but I assured him I’d be fine.

At first, things were great. When he moved in with my dad, Brian would call and text frequently; during his breaks, lunches, and in the evenings. We’d video chat for hours while he talked to me and the kids. On Fridays, he’d come home and visit until early Monday mornings. I’d drive him to work with our two youngest kids, then drive back home. Sometimes, the kids and I would go up Friday afternoon to visit him and my dad and drive back Sunday so he wouldn’t be burnt out.

But then the calls started to slow down. I figured he was busy or tired. One night, because we share locations, I checked the app around 10 p.m. and saw he was at a bar. I texted him, asking what was up. He responded around 3 a.m., saying he’d gone out with friends after work. I felt uncomfortable but told myself not to be insecure. I told myself that Brian deserved to unwind after everything he’d done for me and the kids.

The late nights at bars and restaurants continued for a few weeks. The money in our joint account started depleting from his outings to the point where I had to remind him we needed the money for bills. He stopped coming home on weekends, and when I visited, he seemed distant and glued to his phone.

I asked if everything was okay with him and with us. He said it was. I asked about his new friends, but his answers were vague.

One weekend at my dad’s house, Brian was in another room when his phone rang. The name “V” popped up with no picture. I’d never heard that name before. A few minutes later, my dad’s phone rang. I heard him briefly say something to the person on the phone, then tell Brian to “check his phone when he gets a chance.” Brian picked it up, sent a text, looked at me, and set the phone down face-first. I asked who it was. He just said, “A friend.”

My insecurities got the best of me, so I looked through Brian’s Facebook. He doesn’t post much, but suddenly, all his profile pictures had new “likes” from someone who had me blocked. Using my old unused account (under my maiden name), I found that person. It was a woman named Vanessa, 33F.

On her public page, I saw photos of her and Brian at bars, restaurants, and, heartbreakingly, in my father’s living room and building lobby. In every photo, Vanessa was hugged up on Brian or wrapped around his arm. His wedding ring was off. She tagged him in the photos, but the tags didn’t appear on his profile.

I was devastated. Instead of confronting him right away, I packed up the kids and went home. Brian didn’t protest and seemed clueless. My dad asked if I was okay; I said I didn’t feel well and wanted to leave. Brian quietly helped me pack.

I took screenshots of everything. That was three weeks ago.

Since then, I haven’t talked to Brian much. When he calls, I hand the phone to whichever kid is closest, even the one-year-old. I’ve focused on work and the kids, but I keep checking Vanessa’s page and taking more screenshots as she posts more pictures.

Last night, Brian texted asking why I’d been distant. Furious, I sent him all the screenshots. For about ten minutes, I saw the typing bubble appear and disappear. Then he finally replied: “She’s just a coworker.”

I asked him how he’d feel if I were constantly out with a coworker, hugged up in photos. No reply. I asked why he brought this coworker to my father’s house. He said, “Just to introduce them.” I asked why he hadn’t introduced any other coworkers. Silence.

It’s been about nine hours and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m heartbroken. I don’t want to be a divorced single mom, but I refuse to live in with this kind of disrespect.

Advice needed: What should my next steps be?

TL;DR:
My husband (45M) and I (40F) have been together nearly 20 years and have 4 kids. He took a good job back in our hometown and moved in with my dad to avoid a long commute. At first he called and visited often, but then he got distant, started going out drinking, and stopped coming home. I found Facebook photos of him with a younger woman (33F) out at bars, restaurants, and even at my dad’s house, with his wedding ring off. When I confronted him, he said she’s “just a coworker” and hasn’t spoken to me since.

1o1nhka,relationships,I think I want to leave my partner of 15 years but am scared to death of doing it!,"I (39f) have been in a relationship with my partner (50m) for 15 years, and I don't think I want to be with him anymore.
 
The last year has been tough. He gave up his job to try to turn his passion into a career. We have been living off my salary for that time. I make enough money for us to live well on one income, and to begin with, I was supportive. Over the past year, I have watched him put little effort into his attempt to build a new career. He gets up late in the day, goes to the gym, and enjoys long walks. If he does any 'work', it begins mid-afternoon. He hasn't made any effort to advertise his business.
All the while I am working. I get up early to get to the gym before work, work a full day, and finish late (I have a global role across multiple time zones).

I feel like he is coasting on my income, and I am beginning to feel taken advantage of. He loves his passion project, but I regret supporting it. I didn't sign up to support another adult, and I am beginning to resent his lifestyle. I feel like he is less of someone working to start a business and more of someone who retired early on my income.

I am lonely. He spends every evening in the garage (he has a TV and couch in there), and I spend evenings alone. We eat separately, we go to bed separately, I wake up before him. 

At the same time we haven't had sex in 10 years. There were some mental health issues at the beginning of our relationship, killing our sex life, and we never got it back.

I am hitting 40. I have a career I am proud of and worked hard for. My company offered me the opportunity to work abroad, which I turned down as it didn't work for him. I don't want to marry him as I fear having to support him financially if we break up. We have a house, share our bank accounts, including a lot of savings (all from me).

I want to leave. I want to live by myself. I want to only worry about myself. I want to travel. I want to take up that opportunity to work abroad. I want sex!

At the same time, he is a good person! He loves and supports me so much. I wish sometimes he were a bastard so it would be easier, but he is the kindest person. My family love him. All our friends are his friends, and I have no support network. We still laugh and have fun but that isn't enough anymore.

I am scared to death of leaving! I can not bear the thought of what it means to separate. Selling the house. Fighting over bank accounts. I worry I will miss him. And I am scared of what he will do without me. He has no job. No career. No income. I am scared for his future if I were to leave.

I just don't know what to do. I feel lost :( 

**TL;DR;** : I have been with my partner for 15 years, supporting him financially. He is a good person, but that isn't enough anymore.

1n7merb,relationships,My boyfriend (24m) disinvited me (22f) from a Bali trip we planned together. How can I move forward in this relationship?,"Hi everyone, 

I really need some advice because I feel heartbroken and stuck.

My boyfriend (together for 2 years) has been planning a month-long trip to Bali for basically his whole life. Originally, he always pictured himself going alone, but after we got serious, he invited me to come with him. At first, he seemed genuinely excited for me to join, and I was excited too.

The timing was stressful for me, I had to jump through a ton of hoops at work to get a month off (meetings with HR, an unhappy boss, rearranging shifts). I also bought my plane ticket, which was $1,400. I’ve been doing everything to make this work.

Then a couple weeks ago, he told me he doesn’t want me to come anymore. He said the trip has become “too stressful” with me involved, that he needs to do this alone to “find himself,” and that if he doesn’t go solo, he’ll resent me forever. He even admitted that either I’ll resent him for leaving me behind, or he’ll resent me for “keeping him from this trip.”

Here’s where it gets even harder: he knows that what he’s doing is really messed up. He’s told me that if he could go back in time, he never would have invited me in the first place so that this pain could have been avoided. He admits he’s in the wrong, and he knows how badly he’s hurt me, but he’s still choosing to go without me. He did at least get my ticket refunded, and even though it wasn’t fully reimbursed, he’s giving me the full $1,400 back. But that doesn’t erase how devastated I feel.

I told him I’d try to get over it , that I’d be the one to carry the resentment if I had to, but every time I think about him going, my heart just breaks again. The thought of him experiencing all of these incredible things without me crushes me. I don’t want to see pictures when he gets back, I don’t want to hear the stories, because all I’ll be thinking is: he wanted to live that dream without me.

He says he wants to work through this, and I do too, but I just don’t know how. He’s been through a really hard life, he works constantly, and he says this is finally his turn to enjoy something for himself. I understand that deeply, I really do, but I wish he could also see how deeply hurtful it is to me, and how much I sacrificed to make this trip possible.

When he asks how I’m doing, I usually just respond, “How would you be doing in this situation?” And he’ll say, “Yeah, that’s valid, sorry for asking.” To me, that shows he knows how wrong this is, but he’s still going to do it anyway.

So here I am , I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to process this, or if this is something a relationship can even survive. Part of me understands his reasons, but another part feels completely discarded.

Am I wrong for feeling so hurt? Is this something a relationship can recover from?

Any advice or perspective would mean a lot.

TL;DR: Boyfriend invited me on his lifelong dream trip, I rearranged my life and bought tickets, and now he says he’s going alone. He knows it hurts me but is still going. I don’t know how to cope or if our relationship can survive this.

Edit For Context: Thank you guys so much for your replies so far they have been really helpful. I just wanted to say I know this might sound naive, but I don’t think he’s going to Bali to cheat or anything like that. Knowing him and his past, I really don’t think that’s who he is. If that’s what he wanted, I truly believe he would just break up with me before going. This feels more about him wanting independence and control over this specific dream trip, but it doesn’t make it hurt any less.",379,0.89,379,0,432.0,53.0,26,1756923215.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1n7merb/my_boyfriend_24m_disinvited_me_22f_from_a_bali/,False,True
1hfbn4i,relationships,GF (24F) and I (23M) live in condo owned by my parents and I am going to break up with her. How do I let her down without creating bad blood?,"We’ve been together for just over a year, and moved in with each other around the 8 month mark. She was getting evicted out of her apartment at the time and I never moved out (did college from my parents house) so I thought it was a good opportunity to move out and learn a thing or two about being an adult.

My parents happened to have an apartment and were looking for tenants, so we decided to move into a condo my parents owned. My parents are giving us a great price and all in all the condo location is great.

Once me and my girlfriend moved into, since there was no where to hide, we discovered that we are just too different and incompatible. I won’t really get into the details but, our communication styles are different, and we have less interest in common than we thought, and our energy levels are super different. Even our sleep schedules are different, so I just know she isn’t the one for me. I do however still love her and it breaks my heart but I have decided I will break up with her to stop wasting my time and her time.

I want to do it in the best way possible though, so I don’t hurt her anymore than I have to and that there is no bad blood. I’ve thought about telling her that we are done, but living together in the condo until she’s found another place, while I look for another roommate too. I plan to stay living there indefinitely. Any advice and thoughts on the situation is appreciated.

1k28lsj,relationships,Hubby spoke to me like I was disgusting,"I m, 54F have been living with hubby 55M for 18yrs now. Our relationship has really fizzled in the last 5 or so. No intimacy, no friendship, nothing. I almost left him back in October and I started therapy, he promised to change and try be more of a husband than a grown oscar the grouch. 

We were doing good, we were getting along. I slowly started trusting him again. I actually allowed myself to feel hope and love again. Then one morning I heard a noise behind the stove, I recorded it and waited for him to wake up so I can show him. He did and he had his coffee, he’s inhumane before coffee, so I avoid him. I went to him, and showed him the sound. I said I think I heard a mouse. I played the sound for him he listened and said that’s not a mouse. I said are you sure cause…. he cut me off and got mad. Then he said in his most vile tone ever. One you would use on a stray dog stealing your baby’s food out of her hand. He said “ Go away!” and threw his hand up in disgust. 

I said you can’t talk to me like that. He got even more mad and started arguing that it wasnt a mouse. I said fine it isn’t. and walked away. I felt so stupid for trusting him again with my feelings, I let my guard down and showed him the real me. The me he swears he loves. 

That night when I went to bed beside him I couldn’t sleep. I felt dumb, like a stupid little unwanted ugly kid nobody loves next to him. I told him this and he apologized and said he didn’t mean it that way, that he handled it wrong. He said not to feel that way and that’s not how he sees me. I cried in front of him and felt even more stupid. I havent been able to forgive him, the insult and scar runs deep. 

He’s done and said worse things in the past, I don’t know why I stayed, the stupid hopeless romantic in me maybe. I hate her for it. I will talk to my therapist about this. Im back to sleeping in a separate room and not trying to spend time with him. I don’t know what to do . On one hand it’s a minor thing, on the other it hurt so bad. Im at a loss on what to do. 

Somedays I forget and somedays I can’t be around him out of embarrassment for being me and being made to feel stupid for it. Even though he said he missed the old me, the one he loved before, the happy girl who was always excited to see him and share little things with him. Well I let my guard down and was myself, and that’s how he reacted. The question I have to ask so post doesn’t get removed again, How do I move past this?

1lq5wqc,relationships,"(31M) My fiancée (36F) wants me to cut my long hair, but it’s tied to trauma and autism. It’s been dividing us for years. How do we move past this?","I’m 31 and engaged to my 36-year-old fiancée. We’re planning to get married soon. I love her and she’s important to me, but this one issue has been coming up again and again, and I don’t know how to move forward with it.

She wants me to cut my long hair. I really, really don’t want to. I’ve explained to her many times why this matters to me, but it always ends up being a point of tension, and it’s been this way for years now.

To her, it seems like a small thing. She thinks I’m making a big deal out of it, like it’s just a haircut and I’m being stubborn. But for me, it’s not just about looks. I’m autistic, and I think the sensory aspect of having long hair really matters. I like how it feels. I like touching it. And maybe more than anything, it’s mine. It’s my choice. That matters because I didn’t have that choice growing up.

My mom was really controlling about my hair. She was friends with the hairdresser we always went to, and I think they used to talk before the appointment. I always wanted to grow my hair longer, but she forced me to keep it short. I remember being super clear with the hairdresser one time that I only wanted a small trim. She nodded along, and then made one short pass through my hair and said, “Oops, too late now.” I had no say in it. I was a kid, and it left a mark.

Even after I moved out, the trauma stuck with me. For years I’d just use clippers at home to buzz it off myself. It was quicker, cheaper, easier emotionally. I wanted to grow it out, but keeping it short just felt safer. I wouldn’t have to deal with anyone’s opinions that way. It became a coping mechanism.

In 2020 I finally let it grow. Now it’s probably 12 or 13 inches long. I’ve got a male-pattern baldness thing going on, so it’s probably not the most flattering look by most standards, but I like it. It feels good. It feels like me. For the first time in my life, I’m choosing how I look, and that means something.

She comes from a very traditional religious background and has pretty strong ideas of how a man should look. She’s even brought up the Bible a couple times when talking about this, but I’ve talked to priests and even people from her church, and I’ve been told it’s fine for a man to have long hair. But really, I don’t think it’s about the Bible. I think it’s more about her image of what a man should look like.

I’ve tried so hard to explain that this isn’t about gender. I’ve had some gender dysphoria in the past, but that’s not what’s going on here. This is about trauma, and comfort, and autonomy. And I’ve made big compromises in our relationship. I’ve done a lot to meet her halfway. She’s done a lot too, I won’t pretend otherwise, but I wish she could take a step back and see the big picture. Like, is this really the thing we want to keep fighting over?

To her, it seems like I’m making things harder than they need to be. But to me, this is about reclaiming something I didn’t get to have growing up. And it hurts that she doesn’t seem to see that.

Any advice on how I can help her understand where I’m coming from? Or how we can move past this without me just chopping it off and resenting it?

1m062b2,relationships,My husbands drinking (31yo m) ruins our vacations.,"My husband (31 yo m) is a vacation drinker, and I (31 yo f) am not so much. Weve been married 8 years and are high school sweethearts. He's always been a binge drinker with friends and is very hard to handle alone when he is too drunk, i often need friends to help me with him or we always get in fights cause im a ""buzzkill"" or ""too uptight and I cant let loose"". The reason i am a little uptight and dont drink more than a few beers with him is because at some point in the night there is always a turning point where an argument starts and on those few nights i do drink with him he winds up trying to blame me saying  im drunk and start it, which is rarely the case, or its because im trying to cut him off. A lot of my worries stem from when he used to drink and drive or go out with his friends who would drink a drive. One night he decided to drive home (from 1 hr away where his friends live) because his friends pissed him off. On his way home he got turned around and lost in a town he knows like the back of his hand. His phone was dying and location was off and i could not find him. He was atill 20 mins away from home, and i went out searching for him. This was after he told me he was staying with his friends that night and a terrible gut feeling at 2am woke me up out of a dead sleep that night. I went out to search for him. Thankfully he found his way back home. And i found him on the usual path and followed him the rest of the way watching him swerve terribly... but that night has stuck with me since. After that night, i don't let him go alone when i know he will be drinking. I offer to be his dd so i know he gets home safe because he's too impatient when he's drunk to call me or wait for me to get there. I know it's is enabling him... but i don't want my husband hurt. 

I see these patterns when he drinks and i am highly sensitive to that ""switch"" when he starts acting like he's had one too  many. He's only really a social drinker and may occasionally have a beer or two after mowing the lawn or when we're home at our own pool, but never drinks unless we're on vacation (which feels like it's centered around drinking), or when he is with friends (even on his work trips). This all comes down to tonights fight where he began ""acting"" like he had too much. We are staying in a very very nice hotel where i am here on business and invited him along to relax and have some time off because hes been working a ton. Well, we had plans to go out after dinner tonight and i had asked him earlier that day to not drink too much so we could still go. After work i went out to join him for a bit at the pool before we got ready and he seemed ok but had just made himself another crown and cranberry in his smaller yeti. He bragged to me how the crown bottle was only 1/3 gone when he started at 1pm. It was now 5 and another 1/3 or a little more of the bottle was gone. Maybe down to 1/4 of the entire bottle left. I didnt say anything then but i could feel myself geering up for anything. I continued to have a good time until after we started walking back to our room he was ""pretending"" his speaker was a gun and was making gun noises and shooting at things and people and saying ""fuck them kids"" when i told him to be careful cause we were coming up to a crowd. I dont think anyone heard him but i was being very cautious because of, again, where we are staying. His attitude began here and he started saying ""fine ill just be boring then"" and started acting cold. We got up to the room and he began acting silly again but started becoming kind of abnoxious making noises and mocking me loudly. I asked him if he was ok and tried to tell him only water at dinner, and he said ""i didnt want a soda anyway"" where i reponded with a small laugh that a soda was ok. He kept getting louder and i asked if he was ok again because i wasnt sure if he was being extra, or the last drink did him in. This is really where the attitude came into play. He said he was just going to be boring the rest of the night and started having a really bad attitude. At dinner it became it worse and tension built. We decide to come back to the hotel but everything was ruined. We started arguing and i just feel exhausted. He said it was because i wouldnt let it go and he just wanted to be normal and boring how i like him. I really didnt want this to happen on this trip and am very sad now because he told me that i ruin all our vacations because i just cant handle him being lively and that i cant handle his drinking and dont like it. . Hes told me in the past he likes drinking and ive continuously asked if he could just be mindful and stop himself when hes getting buzzed so hes still here with me. Hes told me before he wants to slow down on drinking, which i have seen him attempt like twice since hes told me that but the last few camping trips he always has to ""buy more beer cause he drank his other half for tomorrow""... idk if im being too uptight or what. When he drinks too much he gets all in his feels and usually gets angry with me. Idk what to do. His dad was a bad daily alcoholic and he's nothing like that, but im tired of the roller coasters and ruined trips when i just want to enjoy his company but he thinks I'm just trying to be his buzz kill. I am a big believer in working things out and that we are all human. I am a very understanding person and do forgive very easily which maybe i need some harsher boundaries...  i don't want a divorce if its redeemable or fixable, which i believe it could be because it's only situational not daily.. Any advice? What can i do to encourage him to be sober on vacations at least. Am i delusional? 

Td;lr: my husband ruins all our vacations with his dining and not being able to pace himself. Tonight he started another fight and said it was because i can't handle him being lively and hate his drinking. What can i do to encourage him to not drink.

1iid251,relationships,My (F33) boyfriend (43M) isn't grooming himself and looks like one of the Golden Girls,"When I met my boyfriend three years ago, he presented himself in a somewhat tidy fashion. He would show up to our dates with a fresh haircut, a trimmed beard, and clean clothes.

As time progressed, he started being more relaxed around me, which led to him abandoning any form of self care. I suspect that he never cared about his appearance and that he was just putting effort in to ""get me.""

Now, I find myself dating an overweight man who has the same hair as Rue from The Golden Girls. It absolutely doesn't suit him, and it's aging him greatly.

I've never seen a man with worse hair in my life, and the sight of his unruly hair is drying up my snatch. It's frizzy, unkept, standing up to all sides and looks terrible.

I suppose I'm a shallow and shitty person, but I really can't help it. Maybe it's due to how I was raised and the beauty standards I've been exposed to. I sincerely wish I'd be able to shake it, but I'm not.

It's not just me, though—a couple of days ago, a stranger tried to hand my boyfriend a couple of coins, assuming he was homeless. It's pretty bad, and I sometimes feel a little embarrassed to be seen with him. I'm also reluctant to bring him with me to family outings because of how feral he looks. 

I've tried talking to him in a kind and understanding way. I’ve tried to be accepting, and I've tried to make peace with it. He gets extremely defensive and tells me that I don't love him and that I need to accept him as he is—which also, by the way, apparently includes toenails that have routinely destroyed his shoes due to their sheer length of them.

I don't know what to do anymore or what's going on. I don't want to be that naggy girlfriend who's always criticizing her boyfriend, but I'm just not attracted to a guy who looks like a homeless grandma who got in a fight with a badger and lost.

Please, I need advice. How can I get him to care about his appearance or at least put some effort in for me?!

Tldr; boyfriend looks feral and it's seriously messing up my attraction towards him.

1nvsv4k,relationships,My (f30) bf(m33) isn’t pulling his weight,"I recently got a new job that is 50+ hours per week and a lot more physically active. Before I took this position my partner (4 years) discussed what this would mean. 

Since he works from home (lax job) and has no other responsibilities he agreed to handle more cooking and cleaning. 

But it has not gone that way. No.

No.

No.

As of right now it’s 11pm and I just got off work. I’ve been gone for 9 hours. I texted AND called him asking if he could not forget to pop dinner in the oven (I even prepped it). And if he could please do the laundry as I have no clean clothes for work tomorrow. And need to go straight to sleep after eating food. 

Y’all. 

I get home and there is a pile of beer cans surrounding his desk. Music is blasting and he’s hollering at his friends.

Food was not put in oven.

No laundry was done. 

He did not scoop our cats litterbox.

Or feed them dinner.

Or do the dishes.

(He was actually suppose to do these the day before)

As soon as he saw me he said “aw crap… I was gonna do those things.. but I got distracted. You sent me a meme and it made me laugh and I forgot the list you made me. I can cook now and start laundry.”

I told him not to bother. I literally have no time to eat now because I need to be at work in 7 hours. Not to mention I’ve had a migraine ALL day.  I am SO angry. How is it that I am constantly forced to do everything because he doesn’t want to, or he forgets, or he was busy playing videogames?

I don’t even know how to talk to him about this. I don’t feel like I am allowed to express any disappointment because of how sensitive he is. If I criticize him or he detects the slightest hint of it he start to act like a victim or throw a literal tantrum. I’ve tried a few times these past few weeks and it turned into a worse argument. He acts like what I expect is rediculous. Yet it’s still less than 50% of the work.


Idk, maybe he’s letting everything slide because I’m not home to “keep things in check”? Remind him 1000 times?

I need to talk to him again about this. It’s upsetting me enough to where I might just walk away. I don’t know how to vocalize it to him. To make him realize I’m serious, where he can’t flip the entire thing around to “me acting like I’m perfect” “attacking him cuz I had a bad day” or any excuse he comes up with. 

TLDR: I took on a new job that takes all my free time. I asked my bf to help carry the responsibilities more cuz I can’t do this alone. He agreed, yet is helping even LESS than before I got this job. I need help to know what I should say to tell him he needs to be dependable. 


Edit: comments were turned off so I will update here. This morning I was leaving for work (we share a car as I’m saving up to buy a new one after my old one got totaled). He grabbed the keys out of my hand and told me he would drive me, because I acted “crazy” last night and he did not trust me to drive his vehicle. You can keep the comments for what I said that was “crazy”. I’ve decided that I am going to end things. However I need to get everything properly in line because I do not trust that he wouldn’t totally screw me over if he knew I was leaving in advance.

She said she was projecting her insecurities on me about my friends, and says I can have my friends back, etc. I've texted my friends who I cut off but they, very understandable, have not responded. She says she will do anything for a second chance. I do love her so much still, but idk if I am crazy for putting up with stuff like this and giving her another chance.

1kkd6r6,relationships,I’m afraid I don’t love my wife anymore,"Hello everyone - using a throwaway account to tell you about my situation.

M33. I have been in a stable relationship with F32 for almost 10 years, 7 of which I have been living together and the last 3 of which I have been married.

My wife has never been the “party lead”, she is introverted and rather closed off. However, with me she has always been outgoing and friendly, intelligent, we share the values of life. We have always been well and in good balance - after all, getting married means choosing yourselves, and we have done so.

Recently, however, I had an epiphany: in the last 2-3 years I have almost no recollection of my wife being enthusiastic or laughing happily about anything. She is always anxious, depressed, sullen. She always comes home sad. She relies on me for everything. Every day there are problems and anxieties, and she tells me that I am the only positive thing in her life.

She has few friends, zero hobbies, she almost never wants to go out. Ever since I had this epiphany, I can't shake it off. I feel like for the past few years I have been on standby taking care of her, but since I realized this I can't do it anymore. I just can't do it anymore. Being alone is now almost a relief. I feel like there is no positivity in the house.

Writing these things is very heavy, frankly I feel like crying. Writing them down makes them a little more real than in my head. I feel a lot of guilt in doing so.

We’re also on the point of trying for a baby. I’ve already told her I don’t wanna live in a sad house. I wanna live with joy, especially with kids. Sharing this to collect your thoughts - has anybody been here before? What did you do?

Thanks

1lrzkt9,relationships,"I think my marriage is falling apart, and I need help. My husband [36M] and I [32F] have been together 6 years, and I think he hates me.","Okay, please bear with me.  This is probably going to get long, and I'm 100% open to whatever advice and opinions you all have to offer.  But I'm also just hoping to get this all down in one place so I can try to organize my thoughts.

My husband and I have been together 6 years.  We have a 2yo together and a 10yo from his previous marriage.  A year ago we bought an old farm property with the plan to tear down the old farmhouse and rebuild a custom home on the property.  We build custom homes for a living, so we knew what we were getting into (I thought).  My role in the business is design and project management.  My husband has stepped back from day-to-day operations and is focused on building our house and maintaining/repairing the farm and it's buildings.  Our 2yo is home full time as we try to manage all of this, and I am responsible for 99% of the childcare for both kids.

My husband is incredibly particular when it comes to standards of work.  He's well known for making licensed carpenters redo work that's entirely proper but doesn't look perfect, just because they have a piece of house wrap upside down or some functional-but-ugly rough framing.  In building our house, he's turned down help from our employees because he just ends up redoing most of what they've done anyway.  And to be clear, their work fully exceeds all code and best practice requirements, he's just so determined that this house needs to be done right that he cannot bring himself to accept anything less than absolute perfection.

So instead of having our licensed and experienced carpenters work with him, he's resorted to having me and my family help him on weekends.  And (to no one's surprise) we don't exactly meet his expectations either.  I can draft you a detail showing exactly how to build every aspect of the house, but I cannot operate the tools with the precision required to execute those details to his standard.  My dad is more than happy to show up and help in whatever way he can, but again doesn't have the skill to meet my husband's expectations.  My husband has gotten to a point where he's so burnt out and frustrated that he's just angry with everyone all the time.  The kids and I walk on eggshells because no one really knows when he's going to explode next.  He can't figure out why our toddler wants nothing to do with him 90% of the time, but it's entirely because she doesn't know what to expect from him.  In the ""before"" he was the most patient and loving Dad, and both kids absolutely adored him.  I was like chopped liver if he was in the room.  Now, they'll go to him if I'm physically unavailable but otherwise all of the parenting falls to me.

To add to all of that, when we first bought the place he thought it would be a good idea to build my parents a second dwelling on the property.  It's allowed under our local rules, and would work out well for all of us from a financial perspective.  It also gets them closer to us for childcare now and support for them as they age.  My parents aren't tidy people who meticulously maintain things (quite the opposite) and that was a concern I've had from the beginning, but originally he thought it wouldn't be a big deal because we'd just maintain things for them as part of the rental agreement.  But he's now so angry about everything that he doesn't want them here at all.  Except my parents sold their house this summer to take advantage of the housing market peak and are now renting while they wait for us to build their house.  So backing out of that isnt really a great option.

And, as a result of all of this, our sex life has all but died.  It's kind of hard to let myself be vulnerable to the person who seems repulsed by my existence, so I guess it's my fault that the bedroom is dying?  I'm not sure, but he seems to feel pretty strongly that it's my problem to fix.  Actually, it's all my problem to fix.

So.  He works hard, I don't dispute that.  I know he's under a lot of stress, and I know I don't have the ability to alleviate that stress.  If I could execute *anything* relating to the house (or anything else) to a standard he'd be happy with, I'd do it in a heartbeat.  But I can guarantee that anything I touch is going to be considered unacceptable, so it's not worth getting involved.

He waffles between wanting me to figure out how to back out of the second dwelling thing and agreeing that it's logically still the best thing for everyone in the long run.  He recognizes that I can't back out of that without destroying my relationship with my parents, and I'm concerned that even if I did blow up that relationship, it probably wouldn't fix all of the issues we're having.

Prior to buying the property and embarking on this whole project, things were good.  We had the typical disputes about chores and communication, but nothing that couldn't be resolved over a coffee during naptime.  I had hope that the issues we're currently having would get better once the house building stress was out of the picture, but I'm getting worried that our marriage isn't going to last long enough to see that point.

So I'm open to absolutely any advice you have to offer.  If cancelling my parents build at all costs is the best move, I'll figure out how to do that.

Tl;Dr: Building a house and my husband is angry and resentful because no one can meet his (incredibly high) standards except himself.  It's impacting everything from our parenting to our sex life, and I'm not sure what to do.

ETA:  Therapy is a no go.  I know it's the right answer and probably what we need, but he absolutely refuses.  I'll bring it up with him again, but he did it with his first wife and it didn't work so he's basically written it off.  One of the most important factors in therapy is choosing to be there and buying into the process, so unless he's on board I don't think it'll get us anywhere.

1kjaw32,relationships,Something odd is happening when I (27F) tell my boyfriend (27M) about my boundaries?,"My (27F) boyfriend (27M) and I have been dating for about four months and I truly adore him. We've always communicated well and haven't had any serious conflicts, but lately, something strange has been happening when I share my boundaries with him. As we've gotten closer and told each other more about ourselves, I've mentioned specific things that I like and don't like (i.e. I don't like when someone eats off of my plate). All of these boundaries are things I haven't felt the need to mention/express because they just haven't come up/posed an issue for us.

The problem I'm having now is that it seems like my boyfriend is going out of his way to do the things that bother me? I gave the food example because it is the one that he is giving me the most trouble over. I struggled with disordered eating pretty badly in my teens and early twenties (thanks, anxiety) and it's only in recent years that I've started to eat ""normally."" That being said, I still struggle with portioning my food without counting calories and generally just eating intuitively, which is why I don't like it when someone eats off of my plate. If you've never had an eating disorder this may seem totally silly, but as I'm learning to trust my ability to eyeball correct portions and balanced meals, it just really bothers me and throws me off if someone is taking random bites off of what I served myself. One day, I will grow past this, but I'm kind of embarrassed by it, which is part of why I hadn't mentioned it to my boyfriend. And it hadn't come up at all! We always just enjoyed our food when we ate together and that was that.

Now that I've mentioned this boundary, my boyfriend either insists on taking bites from my plate or tries to eat off of the same plate and insists that we share a glass to drink out of. Sometimes he'll even try to get us to share a fork and pass it back and forth as we eat, which I'm not interested in doing. Yesterday, I went to eat a cookie and he took it out of my hand as it was on the way to my mouth and told me ""you don't need to be eating this."" (I am in good physical shape and eat healthy 80% of the time -- not sure what the issue is, lol). I told him he wasn't going to dictate what I eat, and he apologized and said he was just trying to look out for my health. When I've confronted him about the food sharing, he's told me that it's just who he is and that it's selfish not to share food. (Also want to add here: it's not like I'm serving myself a plate of food and telling him he can't have any. There's always plenty to serve himself, he just wants to share/eat off of what I've put on my plate).

Can someone please tell me how I can resolve this? All the other aspects of our connection are lovely (so much so that I do want to work through this and not just break up) and I just want to know how I can effectively communicate that this boundary (and others) are important to me? I've explained my past with disordered eating to him and approached it in the most open, honest way possible, but that didn't get me anywhere. Your help and support are appreciated! 

TLDR: My (27F) boyfriend (27M) is being weird about my boundaries and I don't understand why. Need an effective way to communicate/sort this so we can see eye to eye.

1kew11x,relationships,It's coming to the point in my relationship where it's either him or the cat. What can I do?,"My boyfriend 33M and I 28F recently moved in together on March 1 after two years of dating. Everything has been going..alright. We both like things certain ways so there's been growing pains here and there with compromises on each of our parts.

What we haven't agreed on since the move is my cat, Daphne. I have two cats. One of the cats, Frank, is a very nice boy. Super skiddish and scared of loud noises but I've never seen him hiss or be mean to anything or anyone. My boyfriend and Frank have been getting along very well. 

Daphne is another story. She has always been that ""one person cat"" and I'm her person. She tolerates everyone else. If we have guests over she will hiss at them and growl. But she never attacks them unless guests go up to her to pet her without her consent. Which happened the other day. My friend came over and she tried to pet her and she hissed and swatted and meowed raged then ran away. My boyfriend says that he does not want our guests to be afraid of the cat. I just know that Daphnes anger is based from fear and she is really just overwhelmed with new people. So I let people know not to interact with her and keep their distance and Daphne does the same.

My boyfriend and Daphne have not been getting along. It has been a common argument over the months. He is more of a dog person and treats her like a dog. Pets her without letting her sniff him first. Whistles at her to try to call her over (doesn't work) He also makes fun of her and pokes and prods her when she is being hissy and standoffish. 

We were cuddling the other day and Daphne came up on the bed and he pushed her off because she likes to walk on me before settling. He thought she was gonna walk on him so that why he pushed her since he didn't want that. She came back and tried again and he really pushed her, she got growly and pissy and hissed, swatted at him and and ran out of the room.

I've tried to explain to my boyfriend that not all cats are like dogs and some take longer to warm up to. They do not trust right away. He argues that Frank is a good cat and why can't we all live in harmony and get rid of Daphne. Ive tried showing him some Jackson galaxy videos but he says that that is my own biased opinion that I am shoving on him and does not want to learn because he doesn't believe it. He says that if he had a dog that growled and swiped at him that he would rehome the dog cause he respects me. I say that dogs are so different than cats and he has to learn how cats work.

Well he has been trying to get on her good side - only by feeding them wet food at night. Nothing else. He has not tried to play with her (she loves to play) he has not tried to give her space. He says that it is his home and he has a right to feel at peace in it. He doesn't want to tip toe around the cat. Which I agree. I am just at a loss now of what to do because I've tried to help the situation with positive reinforcement and learning videos but he is not wanting to put in the effort because he doesn't believe it will work.

We got in another argument today and he says that something needs to change. It's only been 2 months though and I feel like it would take longer for Daphne to warm up to him. I just didn't know it would be this big of a deal. He doesn't want to ignore her either. I just don't know what to do because it would break my heart to rehome her and I feel like I would always have this guilt and animosity towards my boyfriend after the fact if I had to do that. Which I just can't do. He says he can't believe that I would disrespect him like that and not accomodate him in his own house by getting rid of her. 

I need some advice. What the heck can I do? How can I help this situation? Or is it unhelpable? 

TLDR: Boyfriend and cat do not get along. She is also a hard cat to get along with. Mostly bark and no bite but is just generally moody around everyone but me. It is coming to the point where it is either going to be him or the cat.

1hz36op,relationships,"Partner requires 2 more kids ASAP, will use IVF / donor if I don't agree.","Throwaway account here for obvious reasons.

Me (31M) and my partner (soon 30F) have a lovely kid who is now 1.5 years old. We've been together 8 years. She has always said she wants three kids, I knew I wanted at least one. I assumed that we would take it one kid at a time and see how we felt about the next one, I mean how can you know without experiencing what it's like to have a kid? But that was obviously a terrible mistake.

Now that I've experienced the reality of parenting, and had some severe PPD and anxiety from a bunch of my own childhood trauma and neglect being dragged up from becoming a parent, I feel very scared and uncertain about having the next kid. I'm in individual therapy near-weekly for the past two years. I could very well be one and done. 

She had a very traumatic birth and was scared about doing the next one for over a year but now she's ovulating and wants to go for it. My partner says she HAS to have three kids, and that she'll be unhappy for the rest of her life knowing that two of the kids she should have aren't here. She just knows that three is the number she should have. She basically wanted to be done with all three kids by 30-31. She is very adamant that she doesn't want to be an old mother due to the increased risks and that she wants to be able to watch her grandkids grow up. 35 is too old for her.

She wanted to start at 25 but waited for me until 27 because I felt we had rather serious communication issues and I wanted her to go to therapy. Before she turned 25 I was regularly bringing up issues we had and it was pretty clear to me that the relationship wasn't ready, due to how our fights went and me repeatedly bringing up concerns about how she was communicating with me. I assumed that should have been clear to any sensible person but in hindsight I should have said it plainly to make sure her time wasn't wasted. However, it's long ago and I can't change that now. I have been clear about where I stand in the kid question since she was 25 every time we've talked.

I feel there should be two enthusiastic yeses if we are to have our next kid and that we need to talk this through without pressure before we conclude how to move forward, but this is basically not an option for her and she is extremely sad and upset now. She feels she is out of time and needs to get started NOW with the next kid, since she already waited for me 2 years when I felt I wasn't ready to start our first kid.

I feel an extreme amount of pressure on me and am quite devastated too. She's said that she'll go and have a kid via IVF / sperm donor immediately if I don't want to make her pregnant. Both staying together and separating are options for her if she does that.

If we stay together I'll basically become a dad again anyways, just not to my own biological kid. If we separate, I'll lose a woman I love, time with my kid, our cozy home and life that we've built. And I'll probably be a present adult to the IVF kid in some capacity if we separate, since I'd probably need to help my partner out even if we separate so she has more energy to be a good mother to our kid. I'm starting to feel like I can't stay if she gets assistance to become pregnant. But I don't want our kid to have a broken home either. She says she loves me but she wont choose a relationship with me over having her two missing kids.

She recently started ovulating again and has basically demanded that I make a decision by her next ovulation. I'm disintegrating under the stress and feel devastated that it's come to this. It feels impossible to make a rational decision when I'm so sad and stressed over this.

I also feel like even if I go ahead with kid 2, there is no way to know if I'll want kid 3, and so we might just go through this circus AGAIN in two years.

Anyone got advice on what to do?

TL;DR - Partner has stated that needs to have two more kids to be happy in life and demands that I either make her pregnant ASAP or she will go for a donor / IVF. I could still stay with her according to her but I'm starting to feel like I don't want to be in the relationship anymore if she does that.

Once she was in her new place she started getting packages delivered to her old address frequently. This still happens up until yesterday even. She will always text me at a 10, scared that her package will get stolen and upset that it was delivered to the wrong place. She has been gone easily 6 months now and we’ve had the same convo every other month about her packages. I don’t even bring them inside I just confirm that they’re there and she’ll ask me to put them behind a flower pot which they usually are already bc delivery people know how to do their jobs. I’m a mail carrier myself so her distrust in the delivery people to properly deliver the packages is eye roll inducing. Also she moved within the same neighborhood so she isn’t far away. 

Anyway, I was fine with all that even though it is kind of annoying that she only wants to be nice now that I can provide a service for her, but today she texts me and says “I gave this lady your number, her daughter lived in the duplex before me and got some packages miss delivered to the address” 

Then shortly after I get a long text with no greetings or explanation asking me to bring some packages into my house and give them to her daughter on Saturday. What the hell. 

My old neighbor didn’t ask to give out my number or apologize for doing it or anything. 

I don’t want to be rude to her but I can’t think of a way to say “don’t do that and also update your address” without sounding like a b****. I don’t care if she thinks I’m rude but the idea of being rude is giving me anxiety so I just don’t want to do it for my own peace of mind

Tl;dr someone I don’t know well gave my number to someone I don’t know at all and I don’t know how to tell her that’s not ok without being rude. 

Edit: I ended up sending her this message and then blocking her:

Hey, it’s super not cool to give my number out to strangers. I understand you were trying to be helpful but I don’t want to be responsible this persons stuff. I didn’t mind helping you out in the past but I think you should double check your address from now on before ordering stuff. 

I forgot to say the stranger also tried to call me which I ignored. I haven’t replied to them or touched their packages

Second edit: after I blocked her she reached out with a second number and said a bunch of stuff including that I was paranoid and rude and that she knew I wasn’t cool from the moment she saw me…. Super weird lady I’m glad she officially outed herself bc I will no longer be going out of my way to help her 

Editing my post again bc it’s locked for some reason. To the person who asked how she could tell if I blocked her, when you block someone and they text you the text doesn’t show as delivered on their end, I’m guessing that’s how she knew but I can’t be sure bc I’m not her. She could’ve also tried to call me

Also my sister reached out and pointed out how crazy it was for her to do all that and the neighbor went on another rampage including a voice memo saying how uncool I am, how she has chronic pain and that’s why she wouldn’t say hi to me when she saw me outside, how I’m so awkward and that I abuse my cat bc my cat is overweight. I’ve been working on getting my cat thin after she lived with a roommates cat who was free fed and my cat would eat all the food. My cat now goes to the vet and has a diet plan and is down almost 5 pounds lol. 

Anyway, I think it’s pretty clear now that my old neighbor was mentally unwell and hopefully she will leave me alone now. I have been a little on edge that she will come to my house and do something. We rent from the same property management group still so I kind of wonder if I should loop them in or if it would be too dramatic",355,0.96,355,0,370.0,15.0,39,1741301727.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j58nsq/i_32f_need_help_drafting_a_message_to_my_old/,False,True
1j35chc,relationships,I(33F) asked my husband(32M) to stop making a joke today about our son because it bothered me. It turned into a full blown debate about our senses of humor?,"My husband and his family have a relatively mean, sometimes violent sense of humor. They joke about breaking each other’s kneecaps over money, stabbing each other with forks, joke about death, being dumb, being fat, being ugly etc. (I am almost always totally out of this btw - it’s to each other.) My family has never been like that especially to our parents. We joke but have a different type of humor.

I have never complained about my husband’s sense of humor before and when it’s just the two of us, we spend time laughing and can find common ground humor-wise. We’ve been together for 14 years. At most there were a few times here and there where I would make a passing comment that I would totally not have gotten away with saying a joke like that to my own parents (he joked about stabbing his dad with a fork in a restaurant) but never told him to stop it with his own family.

But ever since our son was born (2M), he’s been making this recurring joke to any family member going on vacation to take our son with them and they always go “no no! I’ll leave him on the plane” or “no no! &lt;describe why it would suck here&gt;”. I’ve heard this joke so many times and it always sort of irked me a bit but I never said anything. 

Today, I just decided, hey, I’m just gonna tell my husband this bothers me so I don’t keep getting annoyed every time I hear it. This was a first for me as I’ve never felt like I had to do this before. I told him “I know you’re just kidding, but it bothers me when you joke about shipping him off and I have to hear your family reject him like you guys are dealing with a hot potato” he didn’t understand why it would bother me so I said it was because he was still just a baby in my eyes and is always so full of adoration for us that I feel this bit of guilt when I hear this stuff about people not wanting him, even as a joke. I even explained that it may be my own deep seated guilt about being a working mom and feeling like I barely get to spend time with our son and how I wish I could go on vacations with him. I asked him if he could try not to use the joke as often, and that if he slips and says it it’s no big deal, or if the other person starts it, it’s fine, I just wish I heard it less

Nothing seemed to get through, he just kept going into a tangent about how I’m sensitive or my family doesn’t have the same sense of humor, how his sense of humor is common in his culture, etc. I said, it’s fine, I know we’re different, I don’t care that we have different senses of humor and I try not to be bothered by those kinds of jokes and I just laugh and let them go and they don’t matter to me (nothing to bad is ever actually directed at me anyway) I just don’t like this one joke. But it turned into a critique of my humor instead any why can’t I be amused by it too.

 I guess I’m frustrated cause I was hoping and expecting him to just say “oh I didn’t know it bothered you, I’ll stop” (+ maybe some discussion on why it bothered me if he wanted it). But instead we debated this for like half an hour and I didn’t see why it had to be this way. I started to regret even bringing this (what I thought was) little thing up. He ended up begrudgingly saying “fine I guess I’ll try not to say it so much?” but it was clear he just didn’t agree and the emphasis on our different senses of humor came back into the forefront with “but why does your family not find this kind of thing funny?” again and around again. 

So what should I do going forward? I try to not be so sensitive towards things, I’ve always been a pretty sensitive person, but I didn’t think calmly asking him to not make this joke anymore was something that would get so much resistance and I’m wondering if it’s indicative of something or if I just need to accept this is how it is.

TLDR: husband and I have different senses of humor. Asked him to not use one recurring joke anymore cause it bothered me, turned into debate on why our senses of humor were different and why wasn’t I just amused ",351,0.91,351,0,390.0,39.0,117,1741072796.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j35chc/i33f_asked_my_husband32m_to_stop_making_a_joke/,False,True
1lix8xn,relationships,"My (28M) GF (27 F) wants kids soon, but her dog runs the house — starting to question everything","I’ve been dating someone for about 6 months, and she’s been clear that she wants kids within the next few years. That’s made me start thinking seriously about our compatibility — and honestly, I keep coming back to how she treats her dog. Don't worry, she gets food and water but she's not in the best situation.

She has a 2-year-old dog that she rescued a year ago — a fairly high-energy breed that clearly needs more exercise and stimulation than she’s getting. She has a small yard to roam around in, but it's not enough. She chews up things in the house when left alone, isn’t crate trained (my partner gave up on that early on), and only knows two basic commands that i'm aware of: “sit” and “down.” Sometimes she’s well-behaved in the house, but other times she’s constantly looking for something to do — items to grab, mischief to get into. Her attention span is very short. I think she gets frequent walks, but probably not enough.

But the biggest issue is that, for at least 7 months now, this dog has been consistently pooping and peeing inside the house — upstairs, mostly in the same spot. Sometimes downstairs if she happens to be down there and the upstairs is blocked off. I thought it was an accident the first time I saw it. It wasn’t. The house always smells. You can tell something’s off in most of the downstairs, but when you walk up the stairs, it is quite noticeable. Sometimes the mess just sits there for hours. I know because I've watched the dog pee upstairs next to a couple piles of poop. It’s gross, yeah, but also kind of heartbreaking — for both the dog and the general state of things. I've noticed on multiple occasions about 15 seconds before she is about to pee and she never picks up on it to do anything about it and show him the correct place to go.

She mentioned early in our relationship that her dog has a ""spot"" upstairs that she goes to *sometimes*. It's not sometimes — it's nearly every day. It’s clear to me now that there’s been no real effort in potty training. She’s not getting any kind of routine. I honestly feel like I care more about the dog’s behavior than my partner does, because I’m the one trying to stop her from going in the house.

Recently, my partner’s started leaving her outside overnight to avoid dealing with the accidents and her being a general uncrated night-terror. It hasn’t been in bad weather (yet), but it feels more like a band-aid than an actual solution. The dog spends a lot of time outside during the day too, mostly wandering a small yard and leaving more than a couple poop piles around. At this point, it’s clear to me that she’s bitten off more than she can chew. She's tried leaving her dog inside too while she goes somewhere, and it's almost a sure-fire way to come home to something to clean up. If she is left inside overnight, I've stumbled upon poop in the morning more than once.

And here’s where I get stuck: I genuinely care about my partner, but I find it irresponsible to own a dog — especially a breed with serious needs — and not meet them. The lack of training, structure, cleanup, and attention says a lot. I can’t stop thinking: if this is how she handles a dog, how would she handle a child? I always catch my self feeling warm and fuzzy about her when we talk and when we are together, but when we are apart I keep thinking of the dog.

I know dogs and kids aren’t the same, but the parallels in responsibility are hard to ignore. I don’t want to be judgmental, but I also don’t want to ignore something that’s clearly affecting how I see her — and our possible future.

I want to approach this issue. This would have been on my nightmare list initially, but I gave the benefit of the doubt when we started dating and assumed things would get better on their own because she was new in the house at the time and she just got him. I'm struggling with how or when to approach her about this, and am nervous about how she will react. I know I need to though. I know I could not share a ***home*** in this condition if we were to move in together, and I’m starting to wonder if this situation is already too far gone — and possibly indicative of deeper issues, like how she might handle children in the future. Don't get me wrong, I actually like the dog and grew up with dogs, but this doesn't feel good.

**I want to see her dog house trained, and doing better, otherwise I won't be able to see a future together.** It's important to me to see effort and improvement in her dog before we move the relationship any further forward. I truly think she is a good person and don't want to upset/offend her. **How do I broach this issue respectfully?**

**TLDR:** My gf of half a year has a dog that hasn't made progress with training. She poops and pees in the house and is under stimulated. She leaves him alone inside only to come home to pee and poop to clean up. I want to see her train her dog.",353,0.88,353,0,409.0,56.0,62,1750725124.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lix8xn/my_28m_gf_27_f_wants_kids_soon_but_her_dog_runs/,False,True
1mwsahh,relationships,"Wife (40F) wants me (45M) to go to therapy over an incident that happened 27 years ago. She is convinced I am traumatized from it. This has fit a pattern of her increasingly psychoanalyzing me and others in an intrusive way, and I don't know what to do.","Storytime! When I was 18 I was on the subway and my friend and I got mugged. I was drunk and resisted, and the guy jabbed me. I didn't even notice for a while until I felt a very wet feeling in my jacket. 

This was not a traumatic event for me. It was a very shallow wound and while it hurt bad (not initially, thats the shock), it wasn't astronomically painful. I was joking with the paramedics on the way to the hospital. I am sure being blackout drunk 'covered' up potential trauma in some way. 

My wife refers back to this incident a lot in the last year. She is convinced that it is basically impossible to get stabbed in such a way and not have PTSD, and that it could be affecting my psyche without me even knowing it for all these years. She increasingly brings it up when we get into little arguments or when I am worried about something she is not (like I kinda freaked out at the sight of a racoon in the park, and she brought it up). 

I have told her countless times, I was not traumatized by that. I didn't even know it happened at the time. And one her rebuttals is ""if you werent traumatized, that means you were conditioned to trauma somehow, which is a problem that needs therapy regardless,"" which always makes me roll my eyes. She thinks of my family as very rough and gruff and crude just because they're italians from brooklyn, when in reality they are not much different than her family. Nobody was 'traumatizing' or abusive to people in my house. My parents were very nice, kind people, they just culturally talk louder and curse more and jokingly tease each other more than she is used to. 

also, I am not some like ""im too macho manly to seek help"" kind of guy. I suspected I had ADHD when I was younger and got myself tested, I am not ashamed of this type of stuff. 

Its not just me. She made an offhand comment to her sister about her child potentially having autism because the kid liked to play strategy games on his computer. And the sister told her that that isn't an indication in of itself, and my wife went on this whole tangent about how difficult autism can be to diagnose and this whole thing about 'special interests' in autistic people. Her sister replied basically saying he doesnt show any other signs besides playing games, and then forcibly changed the subject. We were all kind of flabbergasted that my wife was saying this to her as if she is an authority on this, and also that she kept pushing it. This isnt the only time she has done this weird psychologizing stuff with people. 

I know where she is getting this stuff, she gets it from these social media groups she is on. But like, social media is just about the worst place to educate yourself on any topic. I went through one of the groups and tried to verify some of the claims made on there, and most of it was junk pop science bullshit. I was gonna bring that up to my wife but decided against it. 

This isn't just about the whole 'ptsd subway jabbing' incident thing, although that is the one that bugs me the most. Its about the whole wannabe-psychologist thing she has developed, where she views everything through the lens of mental health. 

What do I do? How do I talk to her about this?

Also, while I know I make her sound kinda bad here, but she is a very wonderful person and we love each other very much. Its been 16 years of marriage together. I hope this doesn't come off too bad in regards to her, but its inevitable when you're specifically talking about a persons problem lol. 

Also, I would not be totally opposed to just going to the appointment so she doesnt bother me about it. But that is missing the point a bit. When does this end?

1nabbv3,relationships,My “friends” went to an event they know I love without inviting me. I feel excluded and don’t know if I should cut them off.,"Hi everyone, I (31M) am feeling really hurt by a group of friends I thought were close to me.

For context, I’m a huge fan of Halloween Horror Nights. It’s something I look forward to every year and I even get a pass so I can go multiple times. A few days ago, I asked one of my closest friends (let’s call him Andrew (24M)) if he wanted to go on Thursday since I saw he was off work.

He told me no because of money. I even offered to buy his ticket, but he still said no. He also texted me things like “I don’t wanna” and “I’ve just been busy” when I mentioned that he hardly talks to me anymore and actually never wants to spend any time together. we used to work together but since i left that job I have only seen him and these other friends when i went to visit. 

Then, the very next night, I find out Andrew and a big group of my other friends all went together—without saying a word to me or inviting me. It stings more since I had just asked Andrew if he wanted to go and he said nothing about the plans which was with a big group of all people I considered my friends. And they know I love to go to this and that I am down to go all the time. I was even going that same night. I have some of their locations and saw they were there too and I think I passed by them at one point and at some point during the night they all turned their locations off. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve been excluded, so it feels like a pattern. After I found out and messaged Andrew that it was wild he turned me down and then went anyway, he never responded at all.

At this point, it feels like they’re sending me a message that I’m not really part of the group anymore. I ended up blocking them last night because I don’t want to keep watching myself get left out. It’s just shitty to think that these are the only friends I’ve made since I moved here three years ago and I continue to get treated this way. 

TL;DR: Asked a close friend to go to Halloween Horror Nights, he said no (even after I offered to pay). The next night he and a big group of our friends went without me. When I told him how crazy that was, he ignored me. This has been a pattern of exclusion, so I blocked them. Am I overreacting, or should I just accept they don’t value me as a friend?",347,0.94,347,0,371.0,24.0,79,1757194075.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nabbv3/my_friends_went_to_an_event_they_know_i_love/,False,True
1juum88,relationships,I (28F) can hear my (75+F) neighbour crying very loudly most nights of the week,"Myself and my partner bought our semi detached house back in Jan/Feb, we introduced ourselves to both of our elderly neighbours.

To note, the neighbour in question was lovely and accepted our baked goods. The only thing we remember of note is that she had very obvious blood clotting in her entire legs (they were almost entirely purple and swollen) and that her house smelled like TCP. She lives alone but has carers going in semi regularly. 

Now the issue, she cries/groans/screams in pain SO loudly 6/7 nights a week... Sometimes she is so loud it wakes me up from a deep sleep.

To note, it's not the being awoken by these screams that bothers me - it's the panic that she might be dying. Every night I lie awake and panic wondering if she's okay.

Anyway, I'm pretty socially anxious and British so naturally I've not addressed it to her head on, I don't want her to feel worse! So last week during a particularly loud, terrifying bout at around 4am I contacted the police to do a welfare check - they went round and I heard her answer the door and confirm she was fine.

The issue is it hasn't stopped, what should my next move be? I can't afford to sell my house as I was made redundant in February 👍

1mg97qq,relationships,My Husband (39M) and I (35F) Are On the Verge Of Breakup and He Doesn’t Seem To Care.,"I’ll try to keep this as concise as possible, but I really could use some advice. I have cross-posted this as I know my husband isn’t on reddit. 

My husband and I both grew up on the East Coast and left for the West Coast after college. We met in our large West Coast city, got married, adopted two dogs and had a baby, all out West. We both had fairly successful careers, had a wonderful daycare and lived in a pretty inexpensive city with an amazing support network.

Here’s where it gets tricky. My husband’s career is within the professional sports realm - not as a player, but on the coaching side. It’s a small field, so I’ll keep it a bit vague. My husband was second in charge of a well-respected and popular minor league, but over the winter he was offered a position being third in charge of a major league team. This was a huge opportunity for him, so we moved our family to a new home a couple of states over.

I HATE it here. The cost of living is very high and we are genuinely struggling. Our rent is nearly $5000 a month for an apartment and while he makes decent money, the gap is killing us. We financially are barely making ends meet.  I had to quit my career and took a remote job making 1/2 what I used to. I am, career-wise, incredibly unfulfilled. We cannot afford daycare ($2000+ per month) so I’m working and being a full time caregiver. It’s exhausting.

My husband works 14-21 days on, 2 off, and 10-14 hour days, in season. Most days he leaves for work by 4a and isn’t home until 430-5p. He works hard and his boss is difficult - there’s alot on the line for his field. He wants to do well and has promised that this move is temporary and in 2 years he should be offered a big promotion, if all goes well. I cannot do two years of this.

My 2-year old wakes up before 6a, I take the dogs out, make breakfast and I try to work for the first couple of hours while he plays. I take an early lunch so we can go to a playground for an hour, before he has lunch and takes a nap. I then work as much as possible until he wakes up. I make dinner, give him a bath, put him to bed, walk the dogs and then finish the work I couldn’t during the day. My husband comes home, takes a shower, eats the dinner I prepare and then needs to “relax” after his long day - if I ask, he will help pick up toys or give out toddler a bath, but it’s rare. I’ve asked him to take over the dogs nightly walk - he will become incredibly upset because he doesn’t think it’s fair that he takes the dogs out at 8p when he needs to be up by 315a. He hasn’t done a single load of laundry in 3 months, has been grocery shopping solo exactly once and hasn’t attended a single speech therapy session with our child. Weekends aren’t a help, since he works. I feel so guilt-ridden at having to work and care for our child so I spend the weekends trying to do big adventures to make up for it. When he does have a weekend off, he’s tired and just wants to hang out on the couch.

We have no support here. Our families live on the other side of the country and come to visit once every 6 months. My mom is taking our child for two weeks at the end of the month, which I’m so grateful for. There’s no one who can just watch our toddler, but we couldn’t afford it even if there was. I’ve asked, begged, cried, pleaded for help and threatened to leave, to try to get my husband to assist, but he won’t. He says he’s under so much stress, he’s doing the best he can…but he has one responsibility - his job. The worst part is that I’m supposed to work, provide full time care and contribute more than 1/2 financially for our family.

I’ve dreamt about just getting in my car with my dogs and child and just moving back in with my mom. Being a single parent is starting to seem appealing because at least there wouldn’t be any illusion of another person being able to help. We have had sex exactly once in the last three months. For Mother’s Day he bought a non-mothers day card (because they were sold out on the morning of, who knew) and a grocery store plant, for Easter he started a fight about filling and hiding eggs, for our child’s birthday, he didn’t order a single item, didn’t buy him a present and threw a fit about decorating which ended up in me crying the night before his birthday. On Christmas Eve, he didn’t want to put together toys for our son, leaving me to do it in our old basement, alone.

I tried again last night to ask for help, to explain how much is on my plate, and he got so defensive and shut down. He angrily took the dogs for their nighttime walk and then went to bed and slammed the bedroom door while I finished work.

Is there a reason to stay? How can I fix this? Should I fix this? Any advice would be amazing…

We have had a rocky relationship and there is one thing I have realized about him that is singularly the thing that bugs me about him.

He can not handle stress. Every little inconvenience in his day leads to hours of dwelling venting and complaing.  It's extremely draining. 

It can be a situation like a family member dying (justified btw) to not getting all the items he ordered through instacart. It is all treated with the same amount of drama. 

While in one of these examples he would be justified in my opinion to struggle the other is annoying. When he goes on and on and on about it I struggle to not snap at him to just stop and get some perspective. 

Not just that but he often complains that I don't open up enough. I open up plenty, I just dont feel the need to vent for 45 minutes every. Single. Time. I have an issue. 

It is really starting to take a toll on my mental health. What do I do about this? How do I approach him about changing this?

I constantly feel like he is expecting me to solve all of his problems all of the time. But he is an adult, somethings he should just be able to deal with right? It's like I'm dating a hormonal teenager. 

Is it a lack of mental fortitude? What's going on here and what do I do about it? I love him but I can't do this my whole life. Am I being an insensitive jerk here or would this drive you nuts too?

1jm0dfh,relationships,UPDATE: I [44F] just found out that my ex [55M] is very ill. Our son [29M] is torn about saying goodbye and I have no idea what to say.,"original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jasjgt/i_44f_just_found_out_that_my_ex_55m_is_very_ill/

Hey everyone. First of all, thank you very much to people to responded so kindly to my original post, especially people who shared personal stories and perspectives. I wanted to reply to everyone, but I was working and then the post got locked somehow.

Short version of the original: my ex, who is my oldest son's father, is gravely ill. My son was very torn about saying goodbye and I was in need of advice to help guide him.

So, my son (Yasha) came over to our house shortly after I made the post. We talked for a long time. My son is a wonderful and immensely strong person, but he doubts himself when it comes to big choices and can get pretty paralyzed. We spoke for a long, long time, and we've continued to talk. Last weekend, he decided to visit his father in the hospital.

I drove him to the hospital and went inside with him. And this is where I'm very ashamed, but I wasn't able to go to my ex's room with my son. I really, really thought I would be able to, and seems extremely silly even typing it. He's in a hospital bed, nothing was going to happen. But I saw him and I had to step outside. I told Yasha and he was very understanding but didn't want to go in alone either. We sat for awhile in the hospital cafe and then he decided to go upstairs alone. I think he called his brother, my youngest son, before he did (they're very good friends), but I'm not sure.

Yasha was there for probably 30 minutes (but again, I think for some of it he was on the phone with his brother, not in the room with his dad). When he came back he said my ex is very sick but knew where he was, who Yasha was, etc. Yasha says that mostly, my ex just talked, mostly about random/irrelevant stuff (sports, politics) and a little bit about some stuff that happened when Yasha was younger (long story, but he was briefly in juvie, and my ex was also in juvie long ago). I get the impression Yasha himself didn't talk much.

So that's that. My ex is still alive last I heard (talked to his cousin on Wednesday), but they're just ""keeping him comfortable."" Yasha is, as always, an amazing and brave man. He says he feels glad he went to see his dad, but only because now he knows and doesn't have to play the ""what if"" game.

I feel extremely guilty I didn't go inside with Yasha. Obviously I can't change it, but I know several people suggested it and I feel like such a shitty mom for leaving him. He amazed me, as always, with his strength, but I wish I could have been the strong one for him. Oh, well. We're going to spend the weekend together.

I wanted to thank everyone for their perspectives - I brought a lot of it up to Yasha when he wanted to hash out whether or not to go, and a lot of people shared really personal, insightful, smart, kind stuff. So thank you. I wish this update could be more satisfying, or that I could have replied to everyone, but hopefully this is okay.

TLDR: After some debate, my son went to say ""goodbye"" to his father. It was pretty uneventful, but I'm proud of him. I'm grateful for everyone's advice. I pretty much only use reddit for crafting stuff (on a different account), but you guys reliably give very kind, good personal advice too. :)",334,0.96,334,0,349.0,15.0,25,1743182500.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jm0dfh/update_i_44f_just_found_out_that_my_ex_55m_is/,False,True
1jvefd3,relationships,"I (22F) regret marrying my husband (23M), especially after he ruined my birthday. How can I fix what I'm feeling?","My husband and I got married a month ago now. I kept wanting to break the relationship off because there were many things I didn't like about my husband, and I felt like I was settling. I always looked at other guys and thought how much happier I would be with them. My husband is attractive when he wants to be, but he turns me off all the time by acting goofy and not wanting to take serious photos, take care of his hygiene, or clean up his apartment. There were some aspects of his personality I didn't find attractive, but I'd had to come to love and accept.

He chose not to write his wedding vows because he was not a writer and wanted to speak from his heart. I was nervous because I felt he would say something off-brand, and sure enough, he made it a comedy show. I thought he wasn't genuine and wanted to get people to laugh.

Our honeymoon was a disaster. He was more focused on his new GoPro than me (which I understand he just wanted to make memories with). I also got sick, and he pushed me to go out and do fun things rather than rest.

For my birthday, he took me on a trip (since he knows I love traveling). I didn't grow up playing outside often, and he wanted to take me on a bike ride for my birthday to breakfast. I didn't know how to ride a bike, and while he was sweet enough to teach me, he immediately took me onto the sidewalk, and I almost got hit by a car. I had an anxiety attack, and I don't know why he didn't want to start slow. Later that day, he took an inexperienced rock climber, which wasn't fun. I get that he's adventurous, but doing that stuff on my birthday is not my idea of fun. He made me cry because I didn't enjoy my birthday at all and had anxiety attacks with all the new stuff I was doing. He never asked if I had done that stuff before and rarely asked me questions about myself. To top it off, he thought it would make me smile and be funny by putting a five candle on my cake. I am 22, not 5.

I love him, but I'm just not happy. Maybe I'm too ungrateful and spoiled. Maybe I have unrealistic expectations. He ruined my birthday. Perhaps I need therapy. I feel like he ruins everything, doesn't even get to know me, and doesn't know what I'd like (for a proposal and birthday, nonetheless). Instead of enjoying talking to me or getting to know me better, he's on his phone or GoPro recording. I keep fantasizing about divorce or cheating, even though I'm loyal and I'm not a cheater. I'm upset he can't do these grand gestures that all my friends get from their men. I'm an overthinker, and I don't know what to do. Could someone advise me on what to think and help me out here?

  
TL;DR I regret marrying my husband because he ruined my birthday, and I don't feel happy. I need advice because I'm an overthinker and probably have high expectations.",333,0.75,333,0,500.0,166.0,110,1744226792.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jvefd3/i_22f_regret_marrying_my_husband_23m_especially/,False,True

Everything was fine until yesterday I decided go and delete my tinder profile and I went to check our old chats. I see that his tinder is already updated like he is searching for someone new. I felt frozen and tired to communicate with him indirectly but I am scared. I don't know what to do. I couldn't sleep crying yesterday. I am meeting him next week only. I don't know if I should ask him about it through phone. I can't stop thinking about it . Its making me more sad and crazy. I am scared I would lose him. 
 
Yesterday I tried to talk to him and I sent him that I trust him and he said to me so he does. I told him if he doesn't want me just say and don't break my trust but he seems he loves me. I am scared now because I need a clarification. I don't know if its accurate to message him but I cannot wait till next week too. Its disturbing me.

1nuy6g8,relationships,I am overwhelmed and my husband says I'm not meeting his needs,"I am 39F, my husband is 31M. We have been married 2 years and have a 17 month old baby. The birth was very complex and difficult and left me with complications. I am also a person with a preexisting auto-immune disease that, since the birth, seems to have gotten worse - chronic fatigue, headaches, joint/muscle pain, gastro issues, etc.

My husband has a full-time job outside the home. I have a full-time (40 hours weekly) remote position that I can do from home. My job is a volume/metrics-based role that requires a certain level of daily production. I also care for our baby during the day; we do not do daycare or in-home care. I will also usually assume most of the shopping duties - if we need things for dinner, I will take baby to the market to get things, etc.

The last year has been rough for us. My husband has gone through two bouts of unemployment (not his fault), so my income has been more important during those times. Things are better, income-wise, now. However, between the job, caring for baby and managing the illness symptoms, I am totally exhausted most days. My husband usually gets home in the early evening and he does help where he can, but I'm still pretty beat most nights. Most evenings, I find myself just wanting to rest, watch tv, etc.

My husband is unhappy with this. He told me that he feels like I am neglecting his needs - he wants more intimacy (and I don't just mean sex here). He says we talk less these days, that I often feel shut down or closed off, etc. He questions why I'm not as physically affectionate as I used to be. I tried to tell him, ""I work two jobs, basically (meaning my paying job and the child care stuff), but he says, ""I work hard too, I want to come home to an affectionate wife."" I feel like I'm just caught in a spiral - I'm so tired, I'm in pain from the illness a lot, I just want to have the little moments on peace when I can get them. He is also upset that on weekends, I often just want to rest or do things close to home. 

He says he needs more affection and intimacy from me, but I just....can't. I help bring income into this house, I take good care of his baby, I keep this home clean and acceptable and running....and I still feel like I'm failing. I've started going into depression because I feel like so much is getting shoveled onto my back...but it's going to cost me my marriage.

TL;DR: I am both a full-time SAHM and WFH employee with an ongoing illness. My responsibilities leave me tired and overwhelmed, but my husband is unhappy because he says I don't make enough time for him or show him enough affection. I'm at a loss for what to do/how to explain to him that I'm trying.

She has no history of substance abuse and the worst we’ve done is smoke weed and take shrooms

She just started using cocaine and I’m beyond terrified. I don’t know what to do or what to say and the first thing I felt when she told me was fear and anger.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? When I got upset after she told me she said she wouldn’t confide in me anymore and that I should’ve gotten to the root problem of why she was using cocaine in the first place.

I’m so worried about her and I couldn’t help but get angry and scared. I don’t know what to do. Is there a way I can navigate this situation without yelling and shaming her? But also convincing her to stop? I don’t mean to make her feel even more shitty, she obviously feels shitty regardless that’s why she started using it.

Please help! I don’t want to be a shitty boyfriend I just want to help her.

TL;DR When my girlfriend told me she started using coke I got scared and angry. I didn’t mean to make her feel worse about her situation, it just worries me and I want to be able to navigate the situation without scolding her but also letting her know what she’s doing is not okay and that I love her and want her to know she doesn’t need to do things like that to cope with life.",330,0.88,330,0,382.0,52.0,103,1744556651.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jy9p4s/my_girlfriend_21f_started_using_coke/,False,True
1inluu2,relationships,Told my boyfriend I loved him right after we had sex. How badly did I mess up?,"I (33f) recently started starting dating this wonderful man (37m) and we’ve been boyfriend/girlfriend for about two months. I don’t wanna get into my history too much, but I’ve never had a boyfriend before. When I was 15 I got pregnant, had my son, then got kicked out of my home, so my son and I started living with my uncle (whom I now call “dad”). I’ve gone on dates here and there, but nothing has ever stuck like this. I’ve also never felt this way about another human being before.

Tonight I was at his place and we had dinner and then we went to his bedroom and had sex. Afterwards (like right after we both climaxed), I melted into his arms then looked at him and said “I love you.” He just kinda looked back at me like he didn’t really know what to say and I internally started panicking so I immediately told him he didn’t have to say it back and try to backpedal a little bit by saying maybe I didn’t know and maybe I was just riding the emotions. He told me I didn’t have to backtrack and he was really happy I felt that way. Before he could really articulate a response, I forcibly asked him if we could just forget it and move on. He said it was ok with him and we just cuddled together for a while before I said it was getting late and should head home. 

When I got to my car, I drove down the road, pulled over and then started crying. I felt so embarrassed and so stupid for saying that and at that time no less. I also have some pretty serious abandonment issues (for obvious reasons given my past) so I’m really scared he’s going to leave me. It’s been a wonderful two months and I feel like this part of me I didn’t know was there before is complete. He has told me I make him feel his worth as a human being who deserves love and I felt very secure in this relationship up until this point.

Please, if anyone has any help or guidance, I would greatly appreciate it. I just really wish I could go back in time and smack myself in the face before I said that.

1hoar0u,relationships,Husband is choosing road biking over our relationship,"Me, wife 57, husband 60, together 13 years. When I started dating 13 years ago I purposely didn’t date guys that had hardcore hobbies. I did tell my husband this when we met. My friend is a golf widow and I saw how their relationship became non-existent. My husband has a tendency to get super obsessed about things so I did know this going in. We used to go boating, fishing, hiking, swimming at lakes, RV’ing, swim in our pool in the summer and have a few drinks, go to the beach, go on weekend getaways, watch movies/shows together. Now our life revolves around his biking. He bikes about 5-6 days a week. He’ll leave in the morning and return about 3-4 hours later, sometimes rides start at 10 and he’ll return 2 pm. There’s a lot of prep before and after plus the some maintenance of his bike/gear. I stopped cooking dinner for us because he wants to eat at 4 or 5 pm at night. He doesn’t suggest activities or trips for us anymore. If I suggest it you can see the pain in his face. He immediately thinks how much this may affect his riding. Forget happy hour drinks at home. That’s just non-existent and was something we really enjoyed doing together. He is emotionally there for me. If my work day is tough or I want to share good things that happen he’s eager to talk, etc. If I ask him to ride less he still doesn’t replace the time with things I mentioned above plus I want it to come from him. I don’t want him to resent me. Before anyone suggests he’s having an affair I’m 100% sure this is not the case. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve talked to him about this several times. He says he’ll do better but doesn’t.

1i1ttux,relationships,Thinking of breaking up with my (30F) boyfriend (25M) of 4 months due to his reaction to me wanting to spend a weekend alone.,"Hi all, I'll try to keep it short but probably won't succeed, sorry. Important info - I live in a different European country to the one I am from. My boyfriend is a native of the country in which I live. I am an extroverted introvert.

I have been single for the past few years, I live alone and have a good job. September of last year I met my boyfriend, 25M, and we started dating. We've been together officially since mid-October, ish and have spent every weekend since we met together. I was a bit apprehensive of the age gap but said I'd give it a go as he treated me really well and is all around a great person. Fast forward to December, I fly home for Christmas, 23.12.2024 until 06.01.2025. I called him a few times and made sure to text a few times every day. I have a big family and don't get home much, so I was busy visiting people, people coming to visit, I had no time ""off"". Going home for me isn't really a holiday, I always joke that I need a holiday to recover from my holidays.

While I was at home, he started sending me messages about ""he doesn't like feeling ignored"" and I'm ""neglecting him"" etc. I apologised but stipulated I was busy at home.

Fast forward, the first weekend I am back in the country we both live in, I go to visit him (he lives about a 40min drive away but I don't have a car as I live in the city, so it's a 2 hour train journey). I had just gotten my period and was exhausted and didn't feel well. He had this idea that we would have a romantic bath and got all this stuff, even after me saying that I said I had my period and wasn't really up for that. I also wasn't up for sex (we usually have a lot of sex) but said we can cuddle, hang out, whatever.

The whole day then he was pouting and sending me on one guilt trip after another. For the first time, in my head I was like ""oh my god, are you a child?"". I had already mentioned during the week that I wanted the next weekend ""off"" and spend it alone at home to have a duvet day and mentioned it again this past Sunday. Well the pouting that followed, you'd think I'd told him I was going to take the weekend to bring his granny out into the woods and shoot her. I tried to explain that I have had barely no time for myself for months, I'm exhausted after the holiday and I. Just. Need. To. Chill. But he can't understand why I don't want him there. We've been talking about this it feels like non-stop.

Then last night he texted me ""please don't start an affair on the weekend you won't see me"". This just boiled my blood. Here's the exchange, translated:

\*\*\*  
**HIM**: *Please don't start an affair at the weekend when you don't want to see me*

**ME**: *I'll repeat myself, but for the last time, it's not that I don't want to see you, but that I need time alone. And I will not start an affair, with whom, I will not even leave my flat*

**HIM**: *Please don't be angry with me, I have accepted I'm not going to see you this week anyway.*

*I just had a bad feeling in my stomach, my dad asked if you were coming back this week or if I was still going to -city- and I said not this week and he said why and I said because you need time alone so that you feel better, which seemed strange to him because that's exactly why a person has a partner, so that the other feel better afterwards.*

*Then he told me a story about -name- (my uncle), my mother's brother, who used to be with a Scottish woman who always cheated on him when she said she wanted to be alone.*

*Then I said if he's crazy that you're not the kind of person who does that then he said he hopes so because he really likes you and you're a lot of fun to be with then I said that you're the best I can have and that -my name- should be alone when she wants to be alone so yes I trust you,*

**ME**: *It's not that I feel bad or that I need this to feel ‘better’. I'm just like this, I need a lot of time alone - I've always been like this and I will always be like this, it has nothing to do with you or anyone else. I \*want\* to spend time alone. I don't want to talk about it all the time either, it will happen more than once that I say I need time alone and I don't want to have to discuss it every time or have to reassure you. I honestly don't know why it's such an issue, but yes. We've spent every weekend together since we met and I just need a weekend to myself. That doesn't mean that I will or want to cheat on you, and I find the ‘accusation’ almost unbelievable, just because I want to spend some time at home in peace. I don't want to talk about it any more, I can't believe I have to justify myself like this over a single weekend anyway. I don't want to argue either, so please let's just leave it, the whole thing is just pissing me off more.*

**HIM**: *I am sorry, I leave the subject for good and never question it again if you want to be alone, but I didn't accuse you. I was just way too excited to see you again and didn't pay attention to what you wanted, sorry I will change*

*\*\*\**

I'm basically over this. It's like a switch has gone off in my head and I can't turn it back on, I find it incredibly unattractive. I can't believe I've had to spend days justifying wanting to spend one weekend alone. I'm now thinking of breaking up with him, but it feels like such a b\*tch move and I know it will break his heart. It's just way too fast and way too much. Honestly? I preferred my life when I was single. That's just the truth. Am I horrible? What do I do.

One more thing to note: I flew home on Monday, Dec 23rd. I had a lot to do that weekend, cleaning my house, packing, buying last-minute gifts. I told him I wouldn't have time to hang out that weekend. He still came to my city, alone, and hung around all day. He said ""you don't have to meet me, I'm just here"". I tried to explain the pressure that put me under, but it was like talking to a brick wall. I ended up meeting him for an hour, but I was pissed off. It feels like there's a pattern emerging. Am I overreacting? Maybe we are just not on the same page, feelings wise.

1omvur8,relationships,"My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) live together: I found out how he sees the world, now I don’t know if I should stay.","(Re-upload with edits: my previous post was removed for formatting.)

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for two years. I live at his house and don’t pay rent (it’s one of his parents’ properties).

Over the last six months our relationship has been slowly deteriorating. I’ve had multiple conversations with him about how his communication style hurts me and others, and how little effort he puts into understanding me.

A few examples:
1 Once, I mentioned seeing a male friend and he spent the dinner spiraling into topics like calling himself (grandparents immigrated from Italy to Aus) as “ethnic” as my Asian/Middle Eastern best friend, saying “no one should be friends with Germans, we’ve moved on too fast from the Holocaust,” and “old people don’t deserve respect.” It was bizarre and uncomfortable.

2 When we need to solve small domestic issues (like fixing a drain), he often derails the conversation into his own feelings rather than focusing on the task, getting visibly upset at me.

3 When I’m overwhelmed and trying to self-regulate by being quiet or still, he panics and asks what he did wrong, which forces me to comfort him instead of calming myself.

4 I’m autistic, and my tone can be flat. He often misreads it as hostility, especially around practical or “adult” topics.

5 The other night, he made fun of the way I walked and looked, even doing a hurtful impression. I said “that’s not a nice thing to do to your girlfriend,” and he exploded into, “what about thank you for cooking dinner? Why is it never thank you?”

The breaking point came this week when we took our puppy to be de-sexed. I filled out the vet consent form while he watched. Because I’d be at work during the procedure, I made sure the clinic knew to call him first. I signed my own name at the bottom (as the form requires) and added his details below. Later that day, I discovered a private ChatGPT thread where he described the whole event with anger and resentment, accusing me of being controlling and writing my phone number in its required section (above his) to “belittle” him. Reading that was shattering. It showed me how warped his perception of me has become.

That’s been our pattern: I act from practicality or care, he interprets it as attack or disrespect.

I wouldn’t call our relationship abusive. Most days are neutral, some are lovely, and about 10–20% of the time things get really painful. He’s affectionate and loving, and I truly love him and the life we’ve built: our home, our routines, our puppy. But when anything serious happens, he becomes reactive, defensive, or mean, and I end up feeling small and unseen.

Logistically, leaving is hard. I work part-time (four days a week) and study at university. If I rent, I’ll have around $400 a week to live on. That means shared custody of the dog, major financial stress, and losing the most comfortable home I’ve ever had. But staying means continuing to feel unheard and distorted.

My question: How do I decide whether to stay or leave when the relationship isn’t entirely bad but feels fundamentally incompatible? What concrete steps can I take to make the right decision?

TL;DR: My boyfriend believes I am antagonising him when I’m taking care of logistics or myself. He’s great most of the time and I love the life we share beyond these issues, but I’m worried I’ll never see him the same. I’d appreciate advice on how to move forward and protect my peace.

1lp78k6,relationships,"Two of my friends (33F, 34F) want to have an 'intervention' for another one of our friends (27M) for their drinking, and I think its a terrible idea.","Two of my friends want to have an 'intervention' for another one of our friends, and I think its a terrible idea. 

For one, our friend does drink more than he should, but not close to alcoholism level. He is younger, 27, and I would say he drinks maybe 6-8 drinks every weekend or two at a party/bar/club, and maybe once every like, idk, 2 months he might get more hammered. Again, more than ideal? Sure. But alcoholism requiring an intervention? Not even remotely close. I would say 95% of the people I know who drank that much at 27 just phased it out as they got older, and the other 5% who became alcoholics had serious problems in their life. 



The two friends who brought this idea up barely drink, they are both very health-focused people and always have been. Their idea of what is 'problematic drinking' is very different from others. One of them is in school for art therapy and I think that is sort of what set this off. The other friend just is sort of following them (they're basically best friends). The art therapy friend brought it up in a group chat with this whole essay about how bad alcoholism is and how friends need to be there to help their friends and alllll this therapy-speak stuff. One friend responded saying it was a bit too far and probably not a good idea and she wrote an essay, again, in the 'therapy-speak' way, about how she understands its uncomfortable to do interventions but you have to do it (it was way, way more than that). Like, we were friends with you in our 20s when most of us drank like him or even worse, and we all ended up fine, and NOW you think its too much? I've talked to a few friends and most of them agree, its way too much. 

Edit: he does not get belligerent at all and is a responsible person at his job and all that. Their concerns are mostly about health and potential risk of addiction in the future.

1hvicu6,relationships,"I don't know how to help my spouse, I feel broken","TW (just in case)

I (F29) am not sure if this is the right place to ask this.

My (M29) spouse and I are in a LDR (temporary). We have always had bad arguments but lately they have been so so bad. I have noticed patterns and he's been attacking my character more. I've realized that every argument is misunderstandings/misperceptions. It is hard to talk without any defensiveness behavior, and I have hit my limit. But the attacking my character thing is getting really bad. He will say things like, ""I've never met anyone like you"" and then just continue, ""You're toxic"". I won't even say anything and he will just continue.
I've asked him to stop and that no matter how much you get upset please do not say things like that out of anger and it is extremely hurtful. He still does it. We have been to couples therapy and have multiple worksheets for healthy communication, and there are so many things he won't implement..

Most importantly
He told me yesterday that being with me makes him want to die. And I am heartbroken.. then he told me that I haven't done anything wrong and that it's him. Today I asked him for clarification, he said he was triggered and didn't mean it. Then later on said that he actually means it... I told him that it's horrible and how sorry I am. That we need time apart, no speaking. He's not for it and says he doesn't need time apart but I do not take this situation lightly. I'm heart broken and do not know what to do. I've been in violent relationships before and it deeply saddens me to hear this. Now I feel like all of the jabs at my character was actually justified. I really thought that  I had been transparent and honest. It's not easy talking to him, never has been, but I really really do try.. 

Advice? Please.. thank you

1i5n78s,relationships,My bf (32M) constantly comments on my belly and I don't know how to handle it,"I (30F) have been struggling with eating disorders since I was a teenager, moving from anorexia to occasional binge eating disorder. I am in a much better state over the past 2 years following therapy but food noise is still something that I struggle with. 

I do exercise enough and I generally like my physique (1.67cm, 60kg) but ideally I would like to make my tummy a bit flatter. I struggled a lot in the past with accepting my body image and my bf (32M) of the past 1,5 year knows about this already. 

He is a very sarcastic person in general and makes such comments for himself, his friends including me. I do accept most of these comments but the ones related with weight are a very thin line for me, given my past and I explained it plenty of times.

Back in May he commented how he would like me to become a bit more muscular in the legs, so I tried doing more lower body exercises to improve this and I did while being on the verge of falling into anorexia again.

Over the past month he keeps on commenting on my tummy and how it should be tighter in a kind of funny way but I am trying to explain several times that given how many times he is saying it, it genuinely gets very annoying.

Yesterday we had a more intimate moment and he literally said DURING intimacy: Turn on the other side because I don't want to see your tummy.

The moment was obviously lost and he apologized several times after saying it was a bad joke. I told him for the first time that this would bring me in a serious thinking about our relationship because I can't be with someone that keeps opening one of my wounds.  
  
I was trying to look like things were ok because there was no point of not speaking with each other but I don't know how to handle it and if it is worth considering to break up with him. Thoughts?

1nils0s,relationships,UPDATE : Bf(28m) is mad over flirty texts I(27f) sent to another guy.,"
ORIGINAL - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/v6mKjNiN9Z

UPDATE -

Thank you everyone for helping out here and giving me some perspective. Lots of self-reflection made me realise a clean communication might save our relationship. And so I did. 

This update is a bit long and emotions are still raw so I apologise in advance. 

I talked to him about what actually is bothering him. He shared.. he didn’t want to date me initially because he didn’t think I was good enough for him back then but overtime he realised what all I offered and asked me out to be his gf. I was hurt but as it was my decision to openly communicate, I wanted to deal with the consequences gracefully. He had doubts about my commitment since I have dated a few more people in the past compared to him who dated only once. I assured him and told him go through every device I own if that can get his doubts cleared. He refused. 

I was still processing everything over the next few days, but my bf’s behaviour changed drastically. He started talking about his ex-gf in-front of me. He would mention how physically attractive she was, how she had a face of a model and voice of a singer, would cook him elaborate meals, dress up beautifully every-time they go out. At this point I was mentally checked out of the relationship but decided to stay to gather myself before making a decision.

Over the next few days he would randomly ask me to name 5 things about myself for..‘why any guy should date me’. He would go through my period tracking app to check the sexual activity I had logged over the years. He started criticising my clothing saying I dress like a h*ker(I am big-chested). 

Idk why I needed to hear all those things before leaving but I finally gathered the courage and left him. I took my apartment’s key back from him. Blocked him from everything. 

The very next day, he showed up at my apartment crying with a bouquet of flowers apologising. I shut the door. It has been going on for 4 days now. Random food items, parcels and flowers keep showing up at my apartment. I can’t move places at of now but I am trying to find a way. 

I can’t completely get rid of him. I have tried, fought, called his parents. It is a process that will take time. 

In the meanwhile, I can’t look at myself in the mirror without feeling ashamed of how my body looks. I don’t think he will ever realise the damage he has done to me but I have promised myself to stay strong. 

I have a few friends who I have opened up to about this and they have been very supportive. It will take me some time to get over all the hurtful things he said to me but I am glad I am out of it. 

If you are going through something similar or have a friend who went estranged after getting into a relationship, please check-up on them. 


TL; DR - I confronted my bf about his doubts, and he admitted he initially didn’t think I was good enough for him. Afterwards, his behavior turned toxic..constantly comparing me to his ex, criticizing my body/clothes, checking my period tracker, and demeaning me. I eventually left him, blocked him, and took back my key. Now he’s stalking me with flowers and parcels despite me involving his parents. I feel deeply hurt and insecure about my body but I’m staying strong with support from friends.

1n1zwxu,relationships,"My boyfriend's mom invited herself along and hijacked our first international vacation and wants to plan our next trip. How do I set boundaries so this doesn't happen again? (25F, 24M)","My boyfriend of three years Tom (24M) and I (25F) booked a trip to France back in January and have been looking forward to it ever since. Last month, his mom (54) asked what hotel we were staying at. I sent her the link, saying “save it for your future trip!” She immediately replies: “Booked for the **same dates**”

Excuse me, WHAT??? I ask Tom wtf this is about and he tells me he did NOT invite them, and that after talking to his family, it seems like they booked the trip a few days ago, so it’s nonrefundable at this point for them, and he doesn’t want to argue with his family. Sigh.

Fast forward to the trip: his whole family is there. Same hotel. Instead of enjoying the vacation I’d planned, we spent it waiting around and eating at mid places because of their dietary restrictions. When Tom and I grabbed coffee alone one morning, his mom texted, “You went without us?”

I asked Tom to set boundaries, but he thought it would be better to talk to them after the trip. He was also sick the first half, so I gave him space. By the end, we were stressed and snapping at each other. At the last dinner, his mom said, “Let’s all go to Portugal next summer!” We exchanged a glance and changed the subject.

This was supposed to be our European vacation together. Instead, it turned into a family vacation. I’m furious and honestly anxious about future vacations.
What would be the best way for Tom to set boundaries? Should he be blunt (“we want to travel alone next time” or even “you guys hijacked our trip”) or softer (“you came with us last time, so this one is just us”)?

We rarely argue, and I love him, but I cannot go through another trip like this. MY MAIN QUESTION is whether to be blunt/let his family feel bad that they ruined our vacation OR let them know gently so we don’t rock the boat and cause future problems?

*Edit: I had to repost as I didn’t realize I had to add we have been together three years. Also, my bf and I are happy together, just want some advice on navigating his overbearing/clueless mom.

TLDR; My boyfriend’s mom invited herself (and the family) on our first international trip, stayed at our hotel, and attached themselves to us most of the time. The trip was miserable, and I don’t want this to happen again.

1jm9lfk,relationships,My (34M) Girlfriend (33F) has monthly mental breakdowns/panic attacks/episodes and I don't know if I can deal with it anymore...,"We've been dating for 2.5 years now. We matched online, (it's a long story but it would give away our identies, but it's quite unique) and I totally fell for her. This has been my longest relationship ever. Just 3 weeks after we started dating we took a road trip to go camping, and that's when I genuinely started falling in love with her. Only a few weeks after that we started exchanging I love yous. She's been able to put up with my annoying quicks, and I with hers. We enjoy so much of the same things, but also enjoy our own things as well. We love traveling, and we've been all over together, and it's honeslty the most fun exploring and experiencing new things with her. She's always open to try new things and experience new food, etc. It's nearly everything I've dreamed of in a relationship. At least well... 70% of it. 

The other part that is totally weighing me down as I approach whether I want to spend the rest of my life with her. Once a month, sometimes more she has a total and complete meltdown. Just totally not functional. I have never seen another adult human cry like this. Like not even just ugly crying, but a 3 year old tantrum level crying. The first time it happened I nearly broke up. But I have too much patience and I let it keep going. I weighed all the positives, and dealing with the one breakdown a month seemed worth it. 

Now some context... my mother growing up would also have monthly breakdowns. Although hers were slightly different, she would get really angry etc. Plates were thrown across the room, smashed into the floor, yelling, threatening of leaving, I just have many vivid memories of my dad begging my mom to stay, apologizing, and groveling her to stay. These images are burned into my brain to this day. It's ultimately probably what led to their divorce. My dad couldn't take it anymore and started cheating and kicked my mom out. 

Every time these happen with my GF it just triggers all those feelings I have as a child, of being frightened, fearing my mom would leave etc. But I bite my tongue, I hold her, comfort her and try to calm her down. These go on for 3-12 hours at a time. I can't leave here alone because then she tries hurting herself, and if I try to do anything other than comfort her, it pushes her further into her spiral. 

She claims she is self aware during these, but she acts like shes reverted to a 3 year old child. She is aware this is a problem, and she get's angry with herself for letting it happen, even though I re-assure her that I understand. I've tried to do research, and help her figure it out, but she get's extremely angry when I put on my ""doctor"" hat. So I've supported her in trying to figure it out, she's been seeing a therapist weekly, sees a physchatrist, has been seen by doctors, she did 6 months of therapeutic ketamine, etc. But nothing has improved, and it's only gotten worse. With one of the recent episodes forcing me to nearly call 911, as she was driving has to pull the car over and started to run away with no coat in the middle of winter. 

And yeah... It's once a month like clockwork. My Mother recenlty made the realization as she's started to go through menopause, her doctors diagnosed her with PCOS, and severe PMDD... and that explains her major freak outs once a month. Because now she's extremely calm... Even just 10 years ago she would call me telling me about he plan to end it. And now she's totally normal. She has expressed it's probably the same for her.

So all I'm thinking about is, will this be my life if I choose to marry her? Can I put up with the monthly breakdowns?

I'm totally stuck, because I do love her, but I really don't know what to do at this point, but I also don't want to hurt her. 

What would be your advice?

TL;DR: GF has monthly breakdowns, acts like a 3 year old child, crys and wails, threatens to harm herself, it triggers my own trauma. I'm stuck and don't know what to do, because I love her a lot, and don't want to hurt.

He can barely walk, does not leave his mothers house except for necessary doctors appointments. I have extreme caregiver burn out, and I’m getting really resentful towards him though I know he is going through absolute hell and none of this is his fault. Seeing him wither away further and in constant pain is beyond devastating and sickening for me to watch these days. I don’t want to do anymore. One of my doctors told me about 8 months ago I cannot watch him pass at the end, and that if she was his mother she wouldn’t allow it.

1lwtc0o,relationships,"How to break up with the nicest guy [27M], I [27 F] have ever dated","I have been going out with a guy for over a month now. 
We know each other since years but had lost contact in between (for like 3 years). Restarted talking over 3 months back. 

There was some initial spark but I don't feel that anymore and I'm sure of it. However it breaks my heart into a million pieces thinking about telling him this. 

The other issue is how invested he is in this relationship. He has full confidence that this is a forever thing and already talks about the future, frequently. He's a green forest (although a bit too idealistic for me) and we are often able to resolve any conflicts that come our way ( I think that's because we are both adjusting people) and this is one of the reasons he has such faith in us working out I guess. He's a sweetheart and says I can take all the time I want, to fully get there.

 I feel absolutely lost and don't know how to end this. How do I approach this? Because I know it'll completely blindside him. 

Tl;dr : Need advice on breaking up with a green forest of a guy who's very invested in the relationship

Edit: Going through the comments (thank you all for your perspectives/advice), I realised I found some comfort in the ones which talked about it being okay if I'm not able to get there, even when the other person is nice - it's like the ol' coin toss theory where apparently you know the option you want even before seeing the result. I kept looking for comments like those. Doesn't make the step any less excruciating but at least there's more clarity. 

And no, there's no one else. In fact, I did go down the hole if I would ever find someone, more so when I'm nearing 30s, if I continue doing this. But that shouldn't be a reason to just be with someone and ruin their life too. 

It isn't about the sex really - I feel like I enjoy it when I feel connected to the person. So it's the connection really, he's a physically fit and fairly good looking guy. 

Update: After 2 weeks of overthinking, I finally took the plunge. We had some disagreement and we were supposed to meet to find a middle ground but before the meet I left a text about how it might be futile to discuss that and that I've something else to talk about. He asked just once if I'm sure and left. Hope he's doing okay.

1lio1oh,relationships,I'm (24 f) thinking of leaving my husband (30 m) after 4 years of marriage.,"The title is exactly what it sounds like. I'm considering leaving my husband. 

He doesn't contribute to chores around the house, and plays games for hours every day. I have to remind him to do basic things like shower, chores, etc. I've told him multiple times that I don't want to parent him, and he'll do better for a day or two and then go right back to it.

He only has two chores. Dishes and trash. And we have a dishwasher. The problem is that he's neglected them for so long that we now have a fruit fly infestation and have to call pest control to come deal with it. I know I should have done something before it got this bad, but he kept reassuring me it would get done.

He's also incredibly impulsive and spends money he knows we don't have. I'm between jobs at the moment, and won't have any pay until July. I've also tried to communicate about this, but he shuts down when I try to talk to him about things that bother me.

There's some other reasons, but these are the big ones. They've only recently become an issue in the last year or two.

He's likely got undiagnosed ADHD. I can see the symptoms and know that these problems are an issue because of the ADHD. I also have ADHD, and use coping strategies to deal with it. I've suggested coping strategies for him, but he says it won't work and won't even try. 

Him shutting down when I try to communicate with him means that I can't talk to him. He refuses to talk to me until I bottle it all up and explode, which he claims reinforces him not talking to me. I've suggested marriage counseling which he claims we don't need.

I do love him, a lot. But these problems are weighing me down so much that I feel depressed over it. I blew up again today, and called him lazy and basically told him he wasn't allowed to play games until he finished his chores and the flies were taken care of. Which makes me feel like I'm parenting him again.

I don't want to leave him, but I'm not sure what else to do at this point. What would you guys suggest?

1l40wm0,relationships,My parents don't think my [31M] boyfriend is polite.,"I (26F), have been dating my boyfriend (31M) for about a two years (we celebrated our anniversary in May). I can tell he really cares for me, but there are certain significant flaws that I have noticed throughout our relationship (however, nobody is perfect - not even me). I recently brought him to meet my family a couple of months ago, and my parents had some thoughts. They were a little afraid to tell me, but thought that I should know, and called me recently to explain all of their opinions:

1. He didn't say ""please"" or ""thank you"" very often, and often his responses sounded like commands. For example, my dad asked him if he wanted anything to drink; he just said ""water"", and that was it. No ""sure, water, please"", or anything. More significantly, he joined my family for a nice dinner because my brother got a new job, and we wanted to celebrate. However, when the dinner ended, and my family paid, he didn't say ""thank you"" to my parents.
2. At the dinner, the waiter was clearing the plates, and he wanted the waiter to also clear his water glass. She told him that the meal wasn't done yet, so he should keep it. But he just said a curt, ""Oh...just take it."" My family and I were both a little shocked at his reaction, because he could have said it nicer, like ""Oh, that's fine, I'm finished with everything.""
3. Whenever he would leave the house, he would just exit the house, and not say ""goodbye"" to anyone. Plus, when my best friend came to visit, he didn't even bother to say good bye to her when she left - he told my brother to tell her goodbye for him.
4. He didn't offer to help cook or wash the dishes, or do any household chores - he just sat on the couch the whole time working (he works as a consultant and is pretty busy), and left his dirty dishes in the sink. Of course, even if he offered, my family would never actually ask him to help, that is customary of being a host. But, it kind of irks me that he didn't even bother to ask.
5. My mom sent him some photos that she took of all of us at an event we all went to, and he never replied. Not even a simple thumbs up for heart reaction. He did mention the photos in passing once, but it wasn't a ""thank you for the photos"". This was kind of strange, because he usually does reply her.
6. I always have to remember to remind him to do certain things, like buy a small gift when coming to meet my parents, or sending them a message during holidays/birthdays. When I met his parents, I did not come empty-handed. He ALMOST did, if it weren't for my paranoid-ass double checking with him the day before.

There were some other points, but I don't want to bog down this post with the smaller details that perhaps my parents were being too nit-picky about (they are VERY traditional immigrants). To clarify, I myself did see some of these habits while I was at home with him, and I tried to explain to him that he should be more generous (?) and polite. He did end up improving on some of the points I made above, but I think there was just too much to point out, much of which is pretty common knowledge. **My question is, is it worth it to try to help him learn and grow these habits?** It seems like he simply just never learned basic manners/habits from his parents. Even my parents said that he seems like a really sweet and caring guy, and he clearly has no bad intentions, but etiquette like this is pretty basic knowledge and they were surprised that he didn't exemplify any of them. In terms of our relationship, I'm not sure if this is something I want to end the relationship over, but could definitely be swayed. There are other pressing issues that would influence me.

He’s off handedly mentioned “when I have kids in the future” type thing a few times but I haven’t said anything since it’s so early in the relationship.

The truth is, I have a genetic condition that makes pregnancy not an option for me, and the chronic illness it causes makes chasing a young child around equally impossible. I haven’t had the heart to tell him yet. I’m not against kids and could see myself going on to adopt/foster older kids in the future.

At what point in the relationship should I tell him this? My sister just had a baby and he’s noticed me being emotional about it and is somewhat concerned. His sister is having a baby next month so I can’t escape from all the baby talk in our families.

1m6a0v7,relationships,I (29F) received a new job opportunity but my husband (31M) does not want to move.,"My husband and I have been married 3.5 years, together 7 years total. I am very career-driven and a big goal in my life is to climb the corporate ladder as high as it will let me go, which my husband knows and has always been supportive of even though he has no desire to climb higher than his current role.

Today I was approached by my company with an amazing new job opportunity making significantly more than my current salary (100k-&gt;170k) but the catch is that I would need to move (Ohio-&gt;Florida). I brought the idea home to my husband and he broke down very upset &amp; adamant that he does not want to move. His reason is that his very close friends live in the same city as us currently and he does not want to move away from them. 

Some backstory that is relevant- my husband’s brother died in a car accident when he was 16 and so my husband’s friends are actually his brother’s friends and they became close after his death 18 years ago. So my husband feels that moving away from his friends is like moving away from the memory of his brother. My husband is also very introverted and has a difficult time making friends outside of people that I introduce him to (I’m very extroverted). His parents snowbird 2 hours from where we’d be moving to, so this would not pull him away from his family.

We’ve reached an impasse and it’s lead me to looking for outside advice. Obviously I don’t want to force him to move and be miserable but I also am extremely sad when thinking about turning down this opportunity. Is there a compromise I’m not seeing?

Things are going good nothing that we cant work through, but there is a pretty big difference in our sex drive and home comfortability.

And i mean ALL the time. I myself am plenty happy with once or twice a week and really making it worth while. I get at the beginning of a relationship, it’s like how many times can we do it in a day? But after the relationship settles in, that game never stopped. I honestly think she would have it 5, 10, 20, times a day if i could keep up. Id like to say im exaggerating but i honestly dont know.

I like sex as much as the next guy but damn…. It isnt even special anymore. Sex is nothing to me now, i actually decline her advances for sex probably 3 times as much as i will initate sexual advances of my own. We’ve had ok talks about it and its thankfully not turned into a fight, just a casual admission that she has a very high sex drive. But thats not all, she also has spent nearly every day at my apartment and when she is home she immediately gets naked and stays naked. I know, what kind of bf complains about that, but over time its had a negative affect. Im completely used to her naked body now. It’s also not special to me anymore. I dont mean that im not attracted to her, she is absolutely beautiful but 90% of the time i spend with her she is naked, and im not. I like to wear comfy clothes when im just chilling at home, and it feels awkward when we spend most of our time here filly naked and me fully clothed. Ive tried to avoid saying anything that would sound judgemental or controlling because thats not how i wanna be and its also not accurate to what im feeling. She started noticing when ever we go out and she puts something nice on, that recently those arethe times  when ive been giving her compliments on how nice she looks. And she thinks im getting used to her naked body, and i replied with “well yeah, i see you naked 10 times more than i see you with anything else on, i kinda am used to it, but that doesnt mean i dont think your beautiful, And im complimenting your outfit because you picked it out and you look good in it.” She didnt say anything but i knew she didnt like that answer and theres this incompatibility building between us that i can feel a fight coming on soon. The more i thought about it tho she was right. Even when shes just wearing the occasional comfy clothes at home with her unkempt hair all about, i find her super attractive and i realize that im just over exposed to her naked body that anything different is actually just new and interesting, and our relationship is oversaturated with sex to the point where other than the few great romantic nights in particular i honestly dont care about having sex with her. Not like im not enjoying it, and finishing if you know what i mean, but i dont care to start it and its even a chore sometimes and i have been turning her down frequently, which also leads to her just playing with herself while i am trying to go to sleep instead, and it is very awkward and i am wide awake during. I never thought too much sex would actually be bad for our sex life, but here we are and i can feel this thing starting to become a problem and i have no idea how to talk to her about it. What the hell do i do? 

TL;DR: my gf has a sex problem and it is oversaturating our lovemaking to the point of losing its spark. 

Edit: Just want to summarize. Im not complaining about having sex 4-5 times a week, that does seem like a very healthy sex life for us, i personally am good with 2 times a week that go all out, but its much more than 5 times a week, and thats with me turning her down as well, and i must add that we rarely have quickies you guys. Not bragging but i work out, i run, i eat good, i take supplements, and i have good stamina, so our sex can last pretty long each time. also, shes on meds that can take a little more effort for her to climax, so im not being lazy here. It’s genuinely alot of work some weeks and sex shouldnt ever be work.

1onsomv,relationships,Husband recycled a proposal from the previous relationship.,"tl;dr husband proposed in the same exact way, word for word, location etc as he did with his previous relationship. How do I get over this? 


I '33F' just found out that my husband '35M' of 7 years, proposed to me in the same exact way as he proposed to his ex wife. 
Same day, Xmas eve, same exact location and used the same shpiel. Thankfully he didn't use the same damn ring too..... 


It's not a situation where he wasn't over the ex. I truly think it's just pure lack of originality or imagination. 
Idk if I'm being dramatic but I am hurt and sick over this. I've cried non stop. Can't look at him or even talk to him. I gave him the ring back and told him to do it over and make it special. I wanted my own. But honestly, if he does, idk if that would make me feel better. How do I move passed this? 
This isn't something I would leave him over but it is something that has definitely hurt our relationship. 
Any suggestions on how to work through this? ",313,0.92,313,0,343.0,30.0,96,1762215053.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1onsomv/husband_recycled_a_proposal_from_the_previous/,False,True
1htq8su,relationships,[UPDATE] My mom (F55) won't accept that I'm cutting her off (F20),"I made a post a few days ago talking about how my mom says I have no right to temporarily cut off our relationship even after she has verbally abused me over the phone regularly when she isn't happy with me. She kept texting and calling nonstop and threatened to hurt herself/ call my university and employer, telling me I'm going to ""regret it"". She blames me entirely for how she acts, even though I am an adult and should not need to abide by her constantly.  [the original post is linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hpx81f/my_mom_f55_wont_accept_that_im_cutting_her_off_f20/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).

It has been a few days since my mom attempted to contact me. I mentioned being worried that she'd fly to where I live and suddenly turn up in front of my apartment (which, fyi, would take a 12 hour flight). Well, turns out, she told my aunt that she's coming to my city next week and she asked her not to tell me. Of course, my aunt being closer with me than she is with my mom, told me immediately. My mom just has no idea that my aunt and I are close.

My mom also called my best friend's mom, telling her that I refused to give her my address. This, of course, isn't true because I had no idea my mom is coming to my city, and my mom has not asked me as I have not spoken to her in a few days. I also thought my mom had my address already because I'm pretty sure I shared it with her before.

I literally have no clue at all what my mom will be doing here, simply because there is nothing to do and it seems like she's deliberately trying to hide that she's coming to my city. Plus, I'm going to have school and work, so I can't see her even if I wanted to (which I absolutely do not want to).

I have no idea what to expect, I'm sure things will be okay, I just need some support.

TLDR; after telling my verbally abusive mother that I'm temporarily cutting off our relationship, she said that I do not have the right to do so and booked a flight to my city behind my back and will be arriving next week. I am not supposed to know that she's coming and I'm unsure of what she has planned.",313,0.96,313,0,327.0,14.0,13,1736029682.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1htq8su/update_my_mom_f55_wont_accept_that_im_cutting_her/,False,True

I don’t invite girls to our house, I work 2 jobs and I’m constantly busy. I don’t even have time to spend with my friends given how busy my work life is. I work a lot to cover our costs given the financial situation we’re both in. Whenever there are people over, it’s usually her siblings. She’s got a little sister and brother. We watch them when her mom needs help since she’s a GM and is going to school part time. So we watch them to help her out. Plus I don’t mind because they see me as their older brother, which I think is cool. I want to prove my innocence, but I don’t know what to do in this situation.

1hbwrhq,relationships,Do I divorced my husband or am I being dramatic?,"I (26F) have been married to my (30M) husband Dante for two years now, together for six years now. Not very long into our relationship I got pregnant with our first child. Dante was really happy about the pregnancy and we were inseparable ever since. (He believes that whatever is meant to happen will happen). He has been my best friend and confidant through all these years together. We grew together. When my son was just over a year old, Dante proposed. Needless to say but I said yes. We were a family but in no rush to marry. Three years pass and we finally tie the knot. Life is great. We communicate well, voicing our thoughts and feelings easily. We do a lot of things together. He brings me silly little presents every other day. Takes our son on mini-trips so I can have some alone time. Truly, we were best friends.

I fell pregnant with our baby girl (second child) days before our first wedding anniversary. Once again, we were both excited. The pregnancy,  sadly, was horrible. I had a lot of complications and could barely function most days without throwing up air (dry heaving isn't fun guys). He tried to help where he could but then tragedy struck. 
Dante lost his job and my income (I work from home for myself) couldn't even begin to support our needs. We moved in with his mother and sister into a house three times larger than the one we had been in (relevant later). Things had always been tense between me and his mother (think emotional incest on her part, he has to meet all her demands all the time or she throws fits). MIL runs a small business and Dante helps her with everything in it, doing most of the work for her, leaving me home alone with my son and my work. No big deal. I need to be the bread winner now. We are partners, after all.
Off the bat I'm expected to clean the house every day, no help from anyone else. I have to look after our son and do all of my work. If I fail to clean even a fraction, I get cussed out because who else is supposed to clean? Keep in mind I am still very sick from my pregnancy. 
I take the heat, trying my best to put on multiple hats at a time, although I'm struggling. Dante is looking for work to get us out but work is scarce. So he devotes his time to his mother and the business, seeing as it feeds us. I'm fine with him being there.
If it just wasn't for our breakdown of communication. No longer am I allowed to voice my concerns or feelings. I have to be picture perfect and happy all the time. No complaining because ""what am I supposed to do about it?"".
Finally, our baby is born and I think, wow, I'm gonna get better now. Nope. Wrong. Because being a fucking woman is just AMAZING. I get body slammed by postpartum depression. 
I stop working for three whole months because of everything. Baby. House. Cleaning. Kid. Depression. I was overwhelmed and didn't know what to do anymore. No help from hubby. Or the kind of help where he takes the baby to LET ME take a bath and then drops the baby with his mother. Our communication is non-existent by this point, not for a lack of trying on my part. He just doesn't want to listen or learn, I guess. I want to slit my wrists but resist the urge because I feel I'm just being dramatic. 
Except... he does the opposite of what I like to do for our second anniversary. Instead of just me and him, maybe with the kids, out for an hour or two, no. What little money he gets (government funding) he goes and organizes a BBQ with the entire family. Ladies and gentlemen, his mother doesn't like me, his sister is odd towards me and I am an INTROVERT. He put zero thought into our anniversary (thinks he just wanted to please his mom but who knows, right). An hour. That's all I wanted from him. To know me for an hour. Even if we just went to a playground for that damned hour. 
Fast forward to now. He has made a friend of sorts with his own business. My husband ""works"" for him. Has been for the last month but we have yet to even talk about any form of payment, let alone saw a penny. I'm still cleaning and cooking and taking care of two kids now. I barely have time to work although I started a month ago again as well. So I sit until the early morning hours to work because I can't get anything done. 
Whilst the rest of the family just carries on like normal, I feel like I'm drowning. I don't get any help from him anymore. We barely talk because he works late most nights and when he doesn't and he is home, he is on his phone or sleeping. Right now my income is the only one that we can say with confidence that we are getting in but I can barely work with everything else. 
I'm exhausted, emotionally and physically. I look at him and wonder who this man is. I wonder how we got this far... 
I'm so alone and so bitter and tired. Would I be better off on my own? My parents are more than willing to help me. They beg me sometimes to just let go and go to them. But I cling to him because when it was good it was great. 
I love him more than anything. 
Should I just divorce him and go to them? Help.

1nf7y46,relationships,"How can I (female, 30s), let down a trans man (30s) gently","I am female with a trans man friend, we are both in our 30s. He transitioned several years ago and I think is still building confidence in who he is.

We’ve hung out quite a bit lately (we’ve been in a group chat for months, and we met in person in June. Since then we’ve hung out regularly, 1-2 times a week and text daily) and there’s been several instances now where I can see he likes me in that way.

I’m sad about it, because I only see him as a good friend and I don’t want him to get hurt, and would hate to lose the friendship. He recently had his support circle uprooted so I feel he has been especially lonely.

As the situation is a bit delicate, I’m seeking advice on how to chart these waters. He has been working on his mental health and seems like in a good place lately (he has had depression in the past). I’m worried if I have to let him down, I may say the wrong thing. Any input would be appreciated, as I’ve never been in this kind of situation before and don’t have many trans friends.

1o4bizh,relationships,27M and really close to buying a home. Parents want to move in after years of toxicity.,"Some background info. I'm 27, oldest son of two. My parents (53M and 53F) have always been bad with finances. Never owned a home, massive amounts of debt and near homelessness have been all things I've had to witness during my childhood. My dad destroys cars like no other, drinks, smokes, can't hold a job and has been a complete asshole to me my entire life. Mother is a devout Catholic and narcissist that failed to ""fix"" my father. I've taught myself everything I know because mother wanted me to be dependent on her for the smallest things like laundry, but wanted me to be responsible for big shit like managing the clients from her business. Broken home all around. 

I knew from a young age none of the shit above would get fixed. Worked my way through college and have a comfy engineering job now. All after raising my sibling and being everyone's therapist because everything's my fault and my moral obligation as the first born apparently.  

The absolute glorious: 

I couldn't wait for the day where I could finally leave for good. And, against all odds, its finally here....

Through work, stock trading, and grinding like a mofo in college since the age of 18, I have a 30% down payment, zero debt and \~1-2 years of expenses saved. I'm in the midwest, so housing isn't as crazy as other parts of the country. I'm finding homes I like and that I can afford. I can fix my own cars, and build some shit. I have until May to find something, that's when our lease expires. I want to buy a house, I've lived in 10 different places already and am burnt out from moving so many times. 

I don't have to pretend, don't have to fix, and don't have to tolerate the obscene illusion of portraying a happy family while everything rots underneath the surface and I'm the family punching bag. 

I don't have to get beat down when I succeed, learn new skills,or when I kick bad habits and improve myself. 

  
The problem? 

My parents and sibling want to move in when I buy something, and are making requests for what the house should have, where it should be located, the works. Because to no ones surprise they have pretty much nothing saved in their 50's, and it doesn't look like they can afford to rent anything after the lease expires. My mother is the main earner of the three of them and doesn't have the cashflow to rent $2000+. 

Originally they wanted me to buy them a home and ""move out if I don't like them"". That shit is not happening, I will not let myself be manipulated any further.

So the question is? How do I handle this? Pack a U-Haul and leave when no-ones home?  Lets say I allow them stay for a while. Set ground rules? Lets say I do that, I don't believe they will change to accommodate the rules or save a damn thing. I have zero confidence I will be able to get rid of them after I let them in. And I've already checked out from this family. They have made dating impossible and hate when I spend time on hobbies or friends. 

I know there is no easy answer, and I do expect it to get very sorrowful very soon. But I want this to be as painless as possible for all parties. I'm a extremely vengeful asshole in situations where I have leverage, and that is a person I do not want to be. 

TL;DR

Broken home parents think they are owed and want to move in with me after years of toxicity. I want to take the least painful route for all that finally gives me peace of mind I've been working for.

1lc3vfw,relationships,"I (F24) feels like my boyfriend (27M) loves me but despises me as a person, and I am very confused.","I have been with him for over 5 years now. We are really different as people : not the same interests, not the same social needs, not the same schedules, you name it. I always thought this difference was enriching. I always saw that he had trouble understanding me, my sociability, my spontaneity, my need for independance and wanting to have fun and be active, or the fact that I am really open with my emotions and sensitivity. But recently I am starting to think that he actually hates the person that I am.

Whenever I do stuff that benefits entirely to me like travel, meet new people, get a new job or change my appearence in any way, he gets sour. If I'm excited about something in my personal life, like something new or an accomplishement, he will shun me or shut me off by not asking that much questions for instance. At his best, he will share the excitement but will always end up bringing it up again in a bad light when he's a bad mood later on. Sometimes I feel I annoy him for being talkative or demanding clear communication.

The weirdest thing of it all, is that it feels like he loves the relationship though. He will give me lots of affection, we have great intimacy, he wants to be invested, he talks about creating a future with me. Over the last 5 years, we of course have had huge arguments that ended up in considering breaking up but he always begged me to stay like everything depended on it.

I am just really confused. It feels like he is in love with me truly but actually deeply despises me as a person. Back in our early years, I was really cutting myself off to be overly present with him, making sacrifices to appeal to his character and to adapt to him. Lately, I have been investing in myself a lot more and listening to my needs before I listen to his, something I hardly ever did. I feel happier and it shows. But it feels like the more I feel happy, the more his resentment is just growing towards me. I try to communicate around that but he shuts off. I feel stuck and confused. Why would you want to be with someone that you dislike so much ? I just do not know what to do at this point.

  
TL;DR : my boyfriend seems really in love with me and is affectionate, but seems to resent me for being who I am whenever I show my true self.

1hm7wa9,relationships,I love my boyfriend but his Christmas gifts were so thoughtless and has left a bad taste in my mouth,"I have never posted on Reddit before, this is a throwaway account. I don't know where to begin, I (34f) and my boyfriend (38m) have been together for several years (3). 

We used to give each other really nice gifts - not necessarily expensive but things we knew the other would like. Things like he got me a signed copy of the screenplay of an obscure movie I like - a favorite movie of mine. And I have gotten him stuff like a big fluffy robe to replace his old one, a mini fridge for his game room etc. It's not a competition but I always try and think about what he would really like. Sometimes it's silver chains, other times it's like a pocket knife (he really likes them).

And so this year I tried as best as I could, I spent probably a little more than I should have but I wanted to give him things he would really like - stuff that he doesn't necessarily need but would be a nice surprise. An official jersey of his favorite team with his name on it, new stuff for his gaming setup (new headset, new monitor, new arm, back pillow for his chair), etc. 

And he got me, well, a set of fridge organizers and a new set of silverware for the house (we live together) that we both said we needed to get to replace our old set. He did get me some candy I like (but he usually eats it more than I do-in fact he ate all the ones I had previously bought and said he would replace them - I just didn't know it was going to be as a Christmas gift), and a robe to match his. He got me a mini multi tool for me that he knows I don't really use and would be more for him. A hair brush because he didn't want to share his. Like, I just feel that the thought wasn't there and he just rushed and got me these things fairly carelessly or stuff that we just needed for the house and wrapped it up and put a bow on it and said Merry Christmas. 

I don't know how to feel and I'm kind of hurt with the lack of thought put into it. I'm not saying I wanted anything expensive I just wanted to feel..  like he actually thought of me as a person. We have been living together for a while now and he knows me pretty well I'd like to think and it just felt ... So shallow. Everything I got felt so hollow and shallow.

And I know I should be grateful for anything but, we are a dual income no kid home and I really don't ask him for much other than splitting the bills and rent. I don't ask him for money. We both have separate banking accounts and I am usually the person to buy takeout or Uber eats if I don't feel like cooking. 

His family gave us both a bunch of gift cards and he tried to give me more of them from the ones he got and it has me wondering if he did that because he knew he didn't really put anything into the actual gifts?

Idk, sorry this got long. But I just thought the gifts would have been a little more meaningful. Like he got me a plastic teen's Wicked the movie makeup travel box knowing I have a nice professional makeup box that has an led mirror because I travel so much for work and stay in hotels regularly. I had bought it this past year and he has seen me use it. 

He also knew earlier this year I had talked about wanting an advent calendar. Even if it was a cheap one, it would have meant he had listened. Or a homemade one.

And idk. I guess I'm just venting but I wish I knew how to bring it up to him like it hurts a bit but I don't want him to get upset at me and call me ungrateful. He saw that I seemed down and he said sorry for ruining Christmas and it made me feel awful so I apologized and said it was nothing. But it..  is something. Idk and lately for all of our gifts this past year it's been this way. 

It feels like he really doesn't care or listen to me. My interests are pretty apparent as I decorate the house with a lot of the stuff he and I like. So idk it just feels very... Lopsided and one-sided.

TL;DR
My boyfriend got me really cheap, and generic household gifts for Christmas when I put a lot of thought and research into his and it just feels like he doesn't care about me and I don't know how to bring it up or feel about it.

1lt4oxd,relationships,"How do we cope when caring for my elderly father is burning my husband, and us, out, and he refuses outside help?","I (52F) live in the UK with my husband (47M), my elderly father (85), and my mum (81). My dad has no hobbies anymore, very little strength, and spends most of his time sitting in silence. He’s always been a stubborn old mule, and now that he can’t do the things he used to enjoy, he’s withdrawn even further. My husband and dad have never had much in common, my husband tried over the years to connect, but nothing stuck. They’re both strong-willed, and the tension has only grown.

For context, my husband cared for his mother until she passed from cancer, and I looked after my grandmother with dementia until she passed. I now work full-time as the breadwinner while my husband has a part-time job and takes on most of the day-to-day care for my father.

He’s completely burned out. He’s constantly cleaning up after my dad, dealing with his habits, and watching him spiral into depression. The emotional toll is huge. My husband often pulls away from everyone, even me and my mum, just to protect his mental peace. I don’t blame him, but we’re at breaking point.

We’ve involved adult social care and made contact with local support groups, but my dad refuses any outside help. He won’t accept respite care or home visits, won’t attend any groups, and insists only we care for him. He’s frightened, extremely stubborn, and clearly very depressed.

All three of us, my husband, mum, and I, are in regular therapy. We’re doing what we can to protect our mental health, but it’s not enough. My dad’s needs are only increasing, and we’re all running on fumes.

How do you care for someone who refuses help, without destroying yourself, your marriage, and the rest of the household in the process? Any advice or experience would be really appreciated.

TL;DR: My husband and I are caring for my increasingly frail, depressed, and stubborn father who refuses all outside help. We’re both burned out, in therapy, and don’t know how to keep going as his care needs grow and he shuts out all support but us. What can we do?

Update: Getting Help for Dad

Please forgive the group update, I would’ve loved to respond to each comment individually, but as you can probably appreciate, time is short right now. My husband and I read through all your comments yesterday, and he was genuinely touched. He said it meant a lot to see so many people care about his wellbeing and mental health too. Thank you.

Quick update: we’re still not able to access assisted living, as Dad isn’t deemed “unfit enough” yet, even though his care needs are clearly increasing. Mum and dad originally moved in with us because my mum couldn’t manage things alone anymore, and it’s been a huge adjustment for everyone.

We’d moved out to where my parents were to try and help, but it’s left us pretty cut off from our own support networks. After a lot of thinking (and tears), we’ve decided we’re going to move back to London, where we have people around us and where there are better care services available. It feels like the right thing for all of us.

I’ve been on the phone all morning sorting things out, but we’re finally getting proper support in place. We’ve just secured power of attorney, carers will be starting soon, and Dad will have access to a local day centre. His GP is also starting him on antidepressants, which we’re hoping will help lift his mood and engagement.

We’ve also requested a reevaluation of his care needs, so fingers crossed that might open the door to more long-term options like assisted living.

Through all this, I’m making it a real priority to protect my relationship with my husband. It’s been challenging, but we’ve promised to communicate better and trying to stay connected through the chaos. And once all of this is in place, I fully intend to take him on a holiday and just breathe.

Thank you again for the kindness and support it’s made such a difference. 💛",295,0.97,295,0,304.0,9.0,28,1751817540.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lt4oxd/how_do_we_cope_when_caring_for_my_elderly_father/,False,True
1hrk3ye,relationships,I Think My Friend Has an Issue With Me Dating White Men,"I’ve come to realize that a white “friend” of mine (27F), who I’ve been close with for about five years, seems to have an issue with me dating white men. For context, I’m a 25-year-old Australian woman of Malawian and Zimbabwean heritage. I don’t discriminate when it comes to race in dating, but most of the men I’ve been involved with have been white. It’s mutual attraction—nothing forced, just natural connections.

I’ve lived in Australia since I was 1, mostly in predominantly white areas, so of course, my experiences with dating white men have been shaped by that.

Over the past year or so, though, she’s been making some questionable comments that have really started to bother me. Recently, she told me, “You need a Black man, that’s what I see you with,” as though my preference isn’t valid unless it matches her vision of me. She also said I should change my Hinge location to places like the U.S. or U.K. where there are more Black men, but then added that I shouldn’t match with white men there.

One of the most bizarre things she’s said was about her experience hooking up with Indigenous Australians. She said: “There’s this thing about white people getting with Indigenous Australians—it’s looked down upon, not that I wouldn’t, but you get me?” That rubbed me the wrong way because it sounded like she was reinforcing harmful stereotypes, even while pretending to dismiss them.

On top of all that, whenever she comes across Black men on her own Hinge feed, she’ll screenshot their profiles and send them to me with comments like, “You’d look good with him.” Nine times out of ten, the guys aren’t my type physically, and I get the sense that she’s only sending them because they share my ethnicity. It feels reductive and almost like she’s trying to box me into dating a specific kind of person to meet her narrative.

I don’t even know why I’m surprised. She’s from a regional town in New South Wales, Australia, where I’m guessing those kinds of opinions are more common. But I think her behavior is coming from a place of insecurity. She’s 27 and has never been on a date. Not to toot my own horn, but I think she might feel threatened by how easily I form connections. I even get a subtle “stay away from my men” vibe, as if I’m somehow encroaching on her territory.

She acts like race mixing is a crime, which is so triggering. It’s exhausting to deal with. I have a niece who’s half Malawian and half Turkish, and I fear for her because of people like this. If she encounters this kind of narrow-mindedness, how will she feel about her heritage?

It’s so frustrating because race mixing has existed for centuries, and people should be free to love whoever they connect with. I mean, even I’m not “fully” Black—I’m of mixed ancestry myself. The idea that anyone, let alone someone I considered a friend, would try to dictate my dating choices based on race is just disgusting to me.

I’m struggling with how to handle this. Have any of you experienced something similar? How did you deal with it?

TL;DR: My white friend (27F) has an issue with me (25F, of Malawian and Zimbabwean heritage) dating white men. She constantly suggests I should only date Black men and tries to dictate my dating preferences by sending me screenshots of Black guys on dating apps. She also made strange comments about “race mixing” and has some questionable views that align with anti-race mixing sentiments. I think this stems from insecurity, and it’s really triggering for me. I don’t know how to handle this situation.",295,0.88,295,0,342.0,47.0,54,1735787274.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hrk3ye/i_think_my_friend_has_an_issue_with_me_dating/,False,True
1ou0rmg,relationships,How do I tell my husband I’m uncomfortable with him staying with a female colleague on work trips?,"I was going to post this on AITAH but since I’m 95% sure I’m not the asshole, I guess I’m looking for relationship advice instead. Soooo… would I be the asshole if I \[38f\] told my husband \[40m\] I don’t want him to stay with a colleague \[45F, single\] when they travel together for work?

My husband and Colleague are part of a dozen independently contracted people within a professional creative group, which manages projects with clients. Husband and Colleague find their work to be complimentary, so they’re hoping to work on more projects together. Husband and I live in City A, we’re from City B (where both sets of parents live), and City C is where Professional Group and Colleague are based.

Last time Husband was working in City C he stayed on Colleague’s couch. Fine, whatever, not a big deal for a one-off thing. Then he had a job in City B last week that she worked with him on, and they stayed at his parents house together Tues-Saturday. To clarify: City B is my hometown, where my family also lives. I didn’t know about this until he was on the way out the door Tuesday. If he had mentioned it I probably would have said “oh, wouldn’t everyone be more comfortable if she was put up in a hotel?” Granted, budget was a consideration, but my feeling is that if the group, client, or husband can’t afford an assistant on a project, then it can’t be a requisite for the job. And this isn’t a one time scenario, he plans to keep working with her, so this will definitely come up again in some iteration.

Relationship background: Husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. We were actually together for a while 15 years ago but our paths diverged. In a crazy full circle way we were brought back together and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in a partnership. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

All week I’ve been dealing with icks and ughs about this. It’s been occupying a huge portion of my thoughts. I was by myself while they were working together every day, sharing meals, presumably hanging out until bedtime? And then of course there are my irrational, neurotic thoughts like “did he make coffee for her every morning? Did she use my MIL’s shampoo? Does he think she’s cooler than me? Is he going to run off to City C because it’s way more rewarding than our life together??” I hate that I’m this insecure and jealous and prone to ruminating on this stuff. Yes, I have a therapist, yes, we talk about this sort of thing.  It *might* be different if I had met Colleague or knew ANY details about her at all. All I know about her is that they have a lot in common and she’s apparently comfortable with this level of familiarity with a married colleague.

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”) He bristles when it comes to personal critique, which makes it hard to express my feelings sometimes. He’s not one to conform to the conventions of society, so me saying “this is objectively inappropriate” or “this simply isn’t done” would not be useful arguments. He usually means well, but can be really blind to how his actions affect me. I’m really hoping that me saying I’m uncomfortable is enough for him to agree to the very reasonable request of getting Colleague a damn hotel room next time.

Ok, so here’s a part I was on the fence about adding in, because all of the above is enough for being upset, but it’s important in the context of my emotional needs not being prioritized (and it definitely adds to my sensitive emotional state). My mom died 3 months ago, so I drove up to City B on Friday to prep for my mom’s Sunday memorial celebration. I thought Husband was going to join me at my parent’s house across town Friday night, but I guess there was a miscommunication and he had to do a bit more work on this project Saturday. We talked about this on the phone Thursday and he told me he was probably going to stay with his parents Saturday night too, so Colleague wouldn’t be uncomfortable at the house without him there. I basically told him no, I needed him with me. I honestly can’t even believe he entertained the idea of prioritizing her comfort over my need for his support during a huge emotional life event. A few days before the memorial.

I love this person. I trust him, but I’m frustrated and sad. Why is he such a dummy when it comes to all this shit?? The big work job is done, and we got through the memorial. Now I guess I’m looking for some communication advice, some validation, and maybe personal experience. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.

1ooax73,relationships,My bf (M23) stood me (F22) up on Halloween and doesn’t know why,"TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and he’s always been amazing, but on Halloween, he stood me up and can't explain why. I want to forgive him, but I am still so upset.

We both had different events to go to first, but we agreed that we’d meet up later at a club, which is something we had discussed all week. I knew he was with friends, so I told him he could invite them, but that regardless of what his friends where doing we were going to go out. I texted around 9 PM that I was ready, and he replied saying he was picking up his friends and would meet me at the club. I told him it was a 20-minute walk for me, so he should let me know when he was heading out.

I didn’t hear back from him until 11:40 PM when he texted saying he was finally on his way. By then, I would’ve gotten there around midnight, and I wasn’t comfortable walking through downtown that late. Plus, he and his friends ended up not even going in because the lines were too long. So, basically, I spent hours doing intricate makeup and dressing up all so that I could be stood up by my own bf.

What made it even worse was that the next day was Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead/ celebrate the dead), which was really important to me as I’m Latina, and I just lost my grandpa. My boyfriend was supposed to help me set up my grandpa’s shrine and make food, but he completely forgot.

He came over with gifts to apologize, but his only explanation was, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened.” When I asked if he thought it was okay for a woman to walk alone downtown that late, he lied and said he would’ve gotten me an Uber, but nowhere in his messages did he mention that. He also tried to play it off as “miscommunication,” when it was really just a lack of communication on his part. I told him I needed space and sent him home.

Later, when he apologized again, he kept saying that thinking about what he did makes him upset and sick. Normally I appreciate when he expresses his feelings, but I told him that in this case, I truly didn’t care how he felt because I was the one who was wronged and upset. I don’t know if that was too harsh, but I genuinely don’t understand how him being nauseous was supposed to help me feel any better.

The next day, after some pushing, he said he’s been emotionally checked out because of how stressful his doctorate program has been and that he forgets things easily when they’re not “in front of him.” I don’t really know what to make of that.

He’s always been supportive and kind before this, especially when my grandpa passed. I don’t think he’s cheating, which I know is always possible, but cheating is one of his biggest fears, so I doubt this is the case. This whole situation isn’t typical for him, but his explanation feels weak, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I want to forgive him, but I also feel really hurt and disappointed.

How would you handle something like this? Should I try to talk to him again, or just give him more space?",291,0.92,291,0,319.0,28.0,129,1762271877.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ooax73/my_bf_m23_stood_me_f22_up_on_halloween_and_doesnt/,False,True

My boyfriend (30M) and I (28F) have been together for three years, and we’ve been talking about moving in together for the past six months. The problem? We can’t agree on where to live.

He insists on a specific upscale neighborhood because it’s close to his gym, work, and friends. The issue? Rent there is way above what I can comfortably afford.

I have compromised, I even offered to cover a smaller percentage of rent since his budget is higher, but he still wants the expensive place and expects me to stretch my finances. When I said no, he called me stubborn and said I’m not serious about the relationship.

I do want to live with him, but I also don’t want to be house-poor or resentful. Am I being unreasonable here? How can we find a middle ground?

1kzyxg1,relationships,I missed my niece's graduation out of fear of getting my girlfriend mad,"My girlfriend (22F) and I (22M) have been dating for over 10 months now. After an event yesterday, I've come to realized that she has full control of my actions.

For the whole time dating, my girlfriend has been very intesne. She is short tempered and gets mad whenever I have to do ANYTHING  that doesn't include her. This includes going out with family and friends. Every single time i go out with them, she constantly texts me and gets upset that I'm not with her. She's always scolding me about how I prioritize my family and friends over her, when I'm not trying to imply that.

Just yesterday, I missed my niece's high school graduation because I was too scared to tell my girlfriend that we should postpone our date night. I feel like such a piece of shit because my niece always went to my graduations, and I couldn't even go out of fear that my girlfriend would get extremely mad. I'm just realizing now that she has full control of my actions, and I can only feel that resentment is going to start building up. 

How should I address this to her? If I tell her that I missed my niece's graduation because of her, she will most likely get mad that I'm putting the blame on her.

Tldr My girlfriend has full control my actions. I missed out on my nieces graduation out of worry she would get angry for postponing out date night.

1jphth4,relationships,My (34f) husband (31m) is a picky eater and it's affecting our marriage,"My (34f) husband (31m) is a picky eater and it's affecting our marriage. 

My husband is an amazing cook. Everyone loves the food he makes. Unfortunately he holds the same standards for others' cooking and does not enjoy cooking himself every day. So he's constantly disappointed or hungry. It's driving me mad that he won't either eat the food I make or make himself something simple.

We've been together for 9 years and married for 4. Now have a 2 year old child together. Important to mention that we're from different countries, different cultures, different religions and had very different childhoods. Despite this, we share the same goals in life, the same central values and the same attitude to parenting. 

For a few years we were in a long distance relationship, so the food thing was never an issue. Then we lived in my country with my father and took turns cooking meals each night. Also no issues. I guess he wanted to make a good impression on my father and would eat everything either of us made. Now we have moved permanently to his country (his home village) he will only eat food from his culture that has been prepared well. 

Here, it's still common that women cook meals 3 times a day for their family. He knew from the start that I would never be that kind of wife. I have tried learning from his sister the past few years but it never tastes the same and the disappointment on his face makes me no longer want to bother. I could spend hours cooking and he'll eat a tiny bit then make another meal just for himself a few hours later. It feels like a massive waste of time for both of us. 

I'm not a picky eater. I'll eat anything. I do not enjoy cooking but will make sure our child and I have food and keep things fairly simple. We live remote and don't have access to a shop - only markets once a week. I already struggle with not having access to familiar ingredients and figuring out what I can actually prepare. There is only one ""restaurant "" where we can eat and it gets very boring eating the same 2 meals there several times a week. 

He's never explicitly asked me to cook more but he does complain a lot that he's hungry and I just want to hear a solution that he'd be happy with. I've tried asking ""what do you want to eat"" and he won't have an answer. He literally won't eat food from any other culture. All I want is for us to be able to eat dinner together in the evenings. 

Things I've tried:
- cooking food from his culture - disappointment that the flavour isn't right
- cooking food that I'm familiar with - won't eat it or eats only a little and needs something with rice later anyway 
- asking him to cook - which he does maybe 2 or 3 times a week (these days are happy for everyone!)
- paying his sister to cook - he thinks she's too busy to do that for us
- cooking just for myself and letting him go hungry - grumpy hungry husband bringing the vibes down for everyone else

What to do??  

Tl;dr: husband has high standards for food and won't come up with a solution. It's a constant cause of conflict and I've run out of ideas to try.

Edit: At home he does half the house work without being asked. He does the food shopping. He does his own laundry and looks after our child. He's the responsible one in his family who people always turn to for help and reliability. We run a successful family business together. He built half our house and manages 3 hectares of land. So this is why I'm so confused why such a simple task as eating or preparing food when at home is such a problem.",289,0.93,289,0,313.0,24.0,89,1743574065.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jphth4/my_34f_husband_31m_is_a_picky_eater_and_its/,False,True
1ieineg,relationships,Husbanddid me a HUGE favor but is making me feel bad about it.,"I'm 37F and my husband is 38M

I went a little nuts 2 years ago when my mother died. I admit I shop as a substitute for therapy, so when she passed very suddenly I opened up many lines of credit, got plastic surgery, developed an expensive plant hobby (mom introduced me to houseplants) and adopted 3 cats to fill the void.

When my dog died, same thing. Laser hair removal, a puppy which I had to subsequently re-home, and plant shopping. I've been slowly working to pay off the $10k credit debt I've accrued.

Well, then I got pregnant and my boss was such a hardass on me for taking time off due to appointments and morning sickness I ended up quitting. Husband said I should take the time to focus on my pregnancy rather than finding work since my pregnancy is high risk (age, COVID, family history of difficult pregnancies) and he didn't want me to stress.

Recently he received a large settlement from a car accident and said he was going to use a chunk of the money to pay off my debt. I told him not to - it was HIS money and he should spend it on himself. His response was, and I quote, ""I'd rather we focus on your debt because it's more annoying."" ... High APR on the cards. Okay, I get it.

Well he paid them off, lecturing me about how I can't do that ever again, and now whenever I ask for something he gets irritated. He said he's already spent enough of his hard earned money on my frivolous desires, and I feel like I can't argue it because he DID. I always say ""and I'm very grateful for that"" and drop the subject.

But I still need things. He'll accept that but make sure I know he ain't happy. I go to the groceries and buy something I'm craving? ""Did you really need to get that?"" A recurring payment or subscription gets charged? ""You should cancel that, you can't afford it."" We walk past the garden center at Walmart? ""NO, Hun.""

He's right about it all. I have a spending problem, we're out one income, and I do my best to steer clear. It's just HOW he relays it: often and heavy. He doesn't like when I say ""thank you"" but gets just as mad when I say ""I'm sorry.""

We were grocery shopping yesterday and there was a wall of orchids for Valentine's Day. I said ""I don't want orchids for Valentine's Day"" and he immediately responded with ""Hun, you're not getting *anything* for Valentine's Day.. heh, I kind of figured you knew that. Don't expect anything for your birthday either.""

I don't need valentines or birthday gifts, it was a joke because I like plants and that was a HUGE wall of orchids. 

I just don't want to constantly be reminded that I am a financial burden when I currently can't do much about it. He wants me to not be stressed for the sake of our baby but when he makes these jabs at me I get stressed! And it's hard to feel gratitude when I only feel shame.

And worse, I'm starting to lose that gratitude, anyway! I didn't ask him to pay my debt. In fact I specifically told him not to. But he insisted, and his mom (who lives with us) told me to not look a gift horse in the mouth. She said he'll get over it eventually. I don't want to be stressed and ashamed of myself for that whole time.

What can I say to him to mitigate the shaming comments? Part of me thinks what he truly wants is for me to suck it up and accept my punishment. 😅 Is that the only solution?

Recently, I learned that the younger sister of my ex from over 10 years ago died tragically in a car accident at only 22. This hit me harder than I expected. When I dated my ex (2.5 year relationship), her little sister was a child (around 9-11), and I have a lot of memories of picking her up from school, playing with her, family dinners, etc. I hadn’t spoken to my ex or her family in years, but she’s also in a happy relationship and our relationship ended quite well.

Out of respect for her life and the bond I once had with that family, I thought about going to the funeral. I told my girlfriend about it, and she reacted really negatively. She felt it was inappropriate and said she wouldn’t be comfortable with me going. She saw it more as a connection to my ex than as me just paying respect to someone who tragically passed.

To avoid conflict and to reassure my girlfriend, I decided not to go. But honestly, I can’t help but feel like her reaction was a bit insensitive. For me, this wasn’t about my ex at all, it was about the sister I knew as a child, who is now gone way too soon. I feel sad that I can’t honor her memory the way I wanted, and also conflicted because I love my girlfriend and don’t want her to feel insecure.

How should I navigate this? Should I have pushed more for going, or is it better to respect my girlfriend’s boundaries even if I feel misunderstood?

TL;DR: My ex’s younger sister (who I knew well as a child) died at 22. I wanted to attend the funeral out of respect, but my girlfriend was uncomfortable and I decided not to go.

The other day, we had a somewhat serious convo on the phone. I asked him what we were, and he was very hesitant on comitting and didn't want a label which tbh wasn't a great feeling... but I go over to his house anyways where he cooks me an amazing dinner from scratch, then afterwards we go to his room and he asks me what I would like to do. I pick movie, but he tries making moves on me and I say “I’m really not in the mood for anything physical.” He then asks why, I just state that I’m not feeling it I would just like to relax and watch movie. He doesn’t like this. He keeps asking why, if I’m upset, if something is bothering me, if the reason is because I am upset. He pins me down so he’s on top of me, and he starts cackling like he kept laughing while thrusting his hips against mine and pinning my arms down so I can’t move. He says that’s it’s too coincidental that I’m not in the mood the same day we had a somewhat heavy phone call, and he tells me he thinks there’s more to it than me just not being in the mood. I kept saying not in the mood and that’s it.. I then say “how would you know there’s more than that?”and then he got really close to my ear and whispered “because I know.” Super uncomfortable, but I’m still pinned and he got close to my other ear to whisper and then I yell. He backs off, and goes “woah there you freaked out on my for a second there, then laughed.” He says “someone is telling you to do this. Who? Let me see your phone, specifically the messages between you and your best friend.”

When I was leaving, he then asks me if something is wrong in a calmer manner.. but then he said “you not wanting s*x is OK, and I was respectful and backed off.” But that’s not what happened.

I ghosted him because of how creeped out I was. Then 2 days later he sends me a 5 paragraph essay about he he cherishes me and wants me to be his girlfriend, and that he regretted not making me his girlfriend sooner. I say no, and we have a phone call where I tell him I don't want to date him because he pinned me down. He claimed that he didn't know that I was uncomfortable, and that he was just playing around and thought something was going on with me so he was just trying to figure out what was going on. He said he had a different experience and had no idea he made me uncomfortable and that he was respectful and didn't push things further. He said he really wasn't trying to have s*x with me and that I took his intentions the wrong way. He didn't apologize so I just hung up.

Then he kept messaging me, asking for another call. He kept saying that he would hate to end what we have over a simple unintentional misunderstanding, that he cherishes me and only wants to treat me with kindness. I told him I'm not interested yet he keeps texting me asking to talk things through, saying that he had no idea that he made me uncomfortable and is sorry.

TLDR I am uncomfortable with how much porn he consumes 

Our relationship is great and doesn't have any other issues. We've been together about 7 months. He(33m) makes me(26f) feel safe and supported. He's so wonderful to me and I'm really happy. Until I found all the porn. 30+ OF subscriptions, saving girls insta posts, hundreds of porn subreddits, hidden photos in his phone(including pics of girls he knows). It makes me feel so self conscious because he's not only masturbating to porn, but just pictures of girls being pretty. I feel like he's fantasizing about every pretty girl he sees. I feel self conscious to let him meet my friends since they're so gorgeous. He tells me all the time how beautiful I am, but now I just feel self conscious.

He's not technically doing anything ""wrong"" since he doesn't know how I feel about it yet. I'm just so uncomfortable. Looking for advice. ",286,0.84,286,0,353.0,67.0,79,1736009495.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1htikg2/found_so_much_porn/,False,True
1jasjgt,relationships,I [44F] just found out that my ex [55M] is very ill. Our son [29M] is torn about saying goodbye and I have no idea what to say.,"I haven’t posted from this account or about anything personal on Reddit in years, but I am in bad need of advice, and last time I posted I got very good advice. So, here I am. 

I have 4 children - my oldest son is 29, my stepson is 24, and my two youngest are 23 and 22. My oldest, Yasha, is with my ex, who I haven’t seen in many, many years. I’ll call my ex Tom. 

Tom put us through a lot. He was not a good father to our son and he was not a good partner to me. I haven’t spoken to Tom since about 2012. Tom has tried to contact me and Yasha a few times since, most recently in 2021, but we didn’t respond. We have been intermittently in contact with Tom’s mother, but not recently (last time was probably 2023). 

Yasha was a wonderful kid who grew into a wonderful man. He’s patient and thoughtful, but he’s very shy and can become extremely anxious and shut-down when it comes to making big decisions. He’s gotten better about this, but for big stuff it’s still really hard. 

I found out yesterday from Tom’s cousin that Tom has pretty advanced liver cancer and is very ill; it sounds like he may die very soon. I told Yasha as soon as I heard. He asked me if he should get in contact with Tom to say goodbye. I said it was his choice; he said he was going to think about it and get back to me. This afternoon he texted me clearly very upset and said he can’t decide what’s right. I told him there was no wrong answer. (I want to be clear—I was not a perfect mom or partner either, but Yasha was a child who did nothing to invite the way Tom treated him, which involved a lot of physical and emotional cruelty.)

Basically, from our conversations today, I know Yasha is going to doubt himself either way. He said he doesn’t want to “betray” me by seeing Tom again, and I said that wasn’t an issue, he wouldn’t be betraying me, etc. He also said _he_ doesn’t want to see Tom, but also does, and especially feels guilty at the idea of not going. I suggested starting with a phone call or reaching out to Tom’s mom and he said maybe. I can tell Yasha is a wreck. 

Basically, I’m spinning out a little bit. I want to help Yasha feel secure in his decision and I REALLY don’t want him to feel guilty, but I just don’t have the words. I’ve talked to my husband and my friends but I still feel lost. Reddit really set my head on straight last time, and I’m wondering if I can get advice now. 

TLDR: my ex is dying. My son and I don’t have contact with him, and he was a very bad father to my son. My son is incredibly torn up about reaching out to say goodbye and I’m looking to pass on reassurance or advice.

1ji1ie1,relationships,My boyfriend (27M) feels that I (27F) make too many snarky comments; I usually resort to these comments because he’s ignoring me when I express it nicely. How can I better handle this situation?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 4.5 years and lived together for 3. Last night, my boyfriend and I watched TV for about an hour. It was only like 9 PM, so I asked if we could watch something else for a bit. He said no, he doesn’t want to because he wanted to read instead. I agreed that we could read, slightly bummed out because I had wanted to watch this new show. Well, we sat down to read and he’s just sitting on his phone scrolling Reddit for a while. At one point, I asked what he was doing and he just said, “Reddit.” A couple minutes after that, I asked if he was planning on reading, and he said “yup,” but kept scrolling Reddit. I was feeling a little irritated, because if he was just going to sit on his phone all night anyways, then why I couldn’t I have a show on? So I made the comment: “Guess we could’ve watched the show after all, since you’re not reading.”

He was annoyed and told me that I’m “always making snarky comments like that.” I didn’t really understand what he meant at first, but then he explained the situations where it usually comes up—mostly household chores. So I was thinking about how we both show up there.

In those situations, it’s like this—we agreed a while back to split up our chores so we’d each have some designated weekly chores. I agreed to do the grocery shop, vacuum, and clean the kitchen. He agreed to be responsible for trash and recycling, and cleaning the shower. The other chores, we both do intermittently. This has been an ongoing sore spot for me, because I do my weekly chores every single week without having to be asked. He, on the other hand, will not take the garbage/recycling out unless it is completely overflowing. He also never cleans the shower—in 8 months, he has done it *one time* and I had to bug him about it for two weeks beforehand.

This is a total annoyance for me, and makes me all the more annoyed because taking out the trash/recycling literally takes one minute, while grocery shopping takes an hour and is a huge pain. So it feels very unequal. Mind you, we are both employed full time, and he works from home.

So what I will do is I will ask him nicely about it a few times. Like, “hey, the recycling bin is really full, can you take out soon.” He’ll respond, “yeah, I’ll do it soon.” Another day or two will pass and he still hasn’t taken it out, so I’ll ask again, “hey, the recycling bin really needs to be taken out.” And he’ll say, “mmyeah I’ll get to it at the end of the week maybe.” I might add, “I really think it should go out today.” And he’ll say something like “yeah, yeah.”

It is at this point that I enter snarky comment land. This evening, he told me I should just be more direct and skip the snarky comment—but I feel like the initial couple of asks *are* direct, he just doesn’t listen to me when I say it nicely?

Anyways, I don’t want to be “constantly making snarky comments” and am happy to work on that. But does anyone have any phrasing of this that would work better than my “nice” way of asking but not come across as bossy or snarky?

**TL;DR: I’ll ask my boyfriend nicely about things, and if he continuously blows me off I’ll get annoyed and resort to a “snarky” comment (not mean, just a little passive aggressive I guess). He wants me to stop making these comments. How can I better handle these situations?**

EDIT: to clarify that he wanted to read in the room with the TV, so he didn’t want the TV on while he was reading because it would be distracting. I thought that was fine if we were actually going to read, but I was annoyed because he wasn’t reading—he was just on Reddit (which he could do with the TV on). I didn’t ask him to leave the room because I thought it’d be more rude if I did that.

This isn’t a common one though—the common snarky comments he was talking about are related to the chores.

Some people already gave some helpful suggestions that I will try out. I think if he still doesn’t respond well to the better communication methods, that seems informative.",270,0.88,270,0,313.0,43.0,75,1742742874.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ji1ie1/my_boyfriend_27m_feels_that_i_27f_make_too_many/,False,True
1oqp2mt,relationships,How can I (21M) make my Chinese dad (61M) get a life?,"The title might sound a bit harsh, but I honestly don’t know how else to phrase it.

There’s a lot to unpack here, but here I go (TL;DR at the bottom):

My dad is a Chinese immigrant who moved to California in the early 2000s. To this day, he hasn’t learned much English, which has really limited his ability to explore new things — even simple stuff like trying non-Chinese restaurants. Over time, that’s made him more closed off and unwilling to try anything new.

He’s naturally introverted, and with his difficult personality and years of working tirelessly since coming here, he’s struggled to make friends. As a result, he doesn’t have many hobbies or much of a social life.

Now that he finally has more free time, I’ve been trying to get him to enjoy life a bit more — to go out, meet people, or pick up a hobby. But whenever I suggest something, he just says things like “There’s nothing to do here in America” or “Nothing interests me.” I know those are excuses — I think it’s hard for him because he can’t read or speak English, so everything outside his comfort zone feels impossible. Still, it’s tough watching him just… fade into routine.

I’d love to know if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice on how to help a parent like this.

**Some background that might be helpful:**  
My dad doesn’t have the best relationship with our family (my mom, sister, and me). He wasn’t really a great husband or father figure when I was growing up. He and my mom fought a lot, mostly because he’d spend so much time at the casino playing poker — which he insists “isn’t gambling” because it “takes skill” and “helps him relieve stress.” But back then, we were struggling financially, living in affordable housing, so it only made things worse.

He also had a lot of anger issues and poor communication skills. He couldn’t empathize or see things from my mom’s point of view, which led to constant fighting. My sister ended up developing lasting trauma from it, and I’ve always had a hard time talking to him too.

That said, something changed earlier this year. We visited some old family friends — people who somehow have stuck by him despite knowing his flaws — and they had yet another intervention with him. This time, it seemed to click. Around the same time, I broke down in front of him and told him how all of this affected me. I think that really got through to him, because since then, he’s been trying to change, little by little.

Honestly, I’m still conflicted. Writing this all out makes me realize how complicated it is. My dad isn’t the best person, but he’s still my dad — and I know he did what he could with what he had. I just want to help him find a way to live more meaningfully instead of wasting away.

**TL;DR:**  
My dad isn’t perfect, but he’s still my dad. He doesn’t have many friends or hobbies, and I want to help him find some so he can live a fuller, happier life. Any advice or similar experiences would really mean a lot.",265,0.93,265,0,287.0,22.0,54,1762504371.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oqp2mt/how_can_i_21m_make_my_chinese_dad_61m_get_a_life/,False,True
1l4ono2,relationships,I am hiding a secret from my partner that feels too late to tell,"I (27f) and my partner (27m) have been together for 5 years. We met in college. I will give a rough timeline here. This is a messy situation and im not proud of who I was back then. Its okay to like sex and be free but i truly regret how everything has come to be.

At the time (2020) my ex Troy introduced me to my friend Zion with the intention of us hooking up. Zion and I hooked up over the course of maybe 2-3 weeks, until Troy admitted he had feelings for me and could not watch this happen. Troy and I started dating, and the three of us stayed friends. Despite Zion and I previously sleeping together we realized we were actually great friends, and (i thought) we were mature enough to have moved past that. There was absolutely no funny business while i was dating Troy. Zion also introduced me to his friends. And we all became great friends. Troy and i broke up after about 6-7 months. Zion was my friend through the breakup, still absolutely no funny business, except for one weak night but other than that back to business. I was also still close to the friend group.

Maybe a month or two after I broke up with Troy  i met my current partner, Dan. I did not date him for another 6 months as i was still a mess, but i introduced him to my entire friend group which included Zion. We have now all been friends for YEARS.

I have recently found out Zion has been making sexual comments about me behind my back  for years. Everyone finds it uncomfortable and it became enough that one of these friends finally told me. I did not feel the need to tell Dan about Zion and i’s previous relationship both because it was short, before i met him, and we were platonic friends for months and then years with nothing to it. But to find out Zion has been disrespecting me and my relationship for so long now makes me feel incredibly bad. It feels like its too late to tell Dan but i’m worried it will come out. If dan finds out our relationship will end and im terrified. It most likely wont come out but now the guilt is eating me alive. But it also feels selfish because maybe I only want to tell him now to appease my own guilt?

Dan has also become great friends with these people and to find out everyone knew but him will hurt. 

It should be clear that Zion is no longer my friend after finding this out. The other people in the friend group also no longer want to be his friend both because of this and other reasons. Zion is done in my life. But what should i do?

Tl;dr i am in a friend group with a man i have slept with and my bf dan doesnt know. It feels too late to tell him (my own fault). What should i do?

1hoy1r6,relationships,"He says he's going to sleep with other people (41M and 39F, 20 year relationship)","TL;DR: my husband has removed all emotional support and says he's going to sleep with other people, but expects to stay in the relationship and me to continue financially supporting him.

The back story...

I'm really struggling in my relationship with my husband of 20 years. 

We've been together since we were at college, with ups and downs along the way, including several pretty severe depressive episodes for me, but I always thought our relationship was rock solid. But the last 18 months or so have been the worst of our relationship, and the last month has been brutal. 

I've always been the bigger earner, but for the past year he's been (voluntarily) out of work so I'm the sole income earner. We've burned through our savings and are now living paycheck to paycheck. I've never cared about money and have been happy to support us, but now he's almost completely removed any kind of emotional support I'm starting to really resent it. Which I hate, I've never been money driven.

He's been seeing a therapist to work out some things (which he won't share with me), and has basically taken a massive step backwards from the relationship, saying it's ""not somewhere he wants to focus his energy right now"". He's discovered the concept of boundaries, but it basically means that in his mind I'm crossing boundaries if I ask him any kind of question he doesn't want to answer, or share any of my thoughts or feelings with him without first checking if he's ok with that. He's currently out for the second evening this week and won't answer any questions about where he's going, who with etc - me showing any curiosity is me not respecting his boundaries. I'm super sceptical of this therapist, because she's given him terrible advice in the past (told him to let out his anger during arguments by kicking doors, punching walls etc) that he's taken as gospel.

At one point he was saying he needed space, so I suggested he move out temporarily to stay at his friend's place (his friend was overseas and he was looking after the pets, so there was an empty apartment he could stay in). Our interactions were so painful during that time that I thought it would make things easier for both of us. He flat out refused to leave. 

We have kids, and a mortgage, and no spare money to pay for lawyers or separate accommodation. I think he's been struggling with depression for at least the last 6 months, but won't talk to me about it. And it feels like he's unhappy with his life and is blaming it on me/the relationship. I feel like if he got out for a bit he might have time to reflect on whether it's really the cause of the depression.

I don't want to be the asshole who leaves someone when they're at a low point, but this is so incredibly painful. I'm losing respect for him by the day and feel pathetic for putting up with being treated like this.

He approached me for sex last night and I refused - I wasn't in the right emotional state for that. We had sex about 3 days ago and he was super rough and it left me feeling really fragile. This morning he told me that I'm not meeting his sexual needs and that he's going to sleep with other people. But he still doesn't want to move out and he wants to stay in the relationship. He says he has a need that's not being met, and that he's entitled to go elsewhere to get it met. For context, we have sex 2-4 times a week but it's never enough for him, or never the right type of sex (I'm open to most things but not a fan of anal).. 

I said that if he sleeps with someone else, the relationship is over. He said I can leave if I want to, but he's not going anywhere. 

Are there any specific things I can do to get through this? Is there any way back from this?",269,0.9,269,0,303.0,34.0,49,1735485481.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hoy1r6/he_says_hes_going_to_sleep_with_other_people_41m/,False,True

1i9ejr1,relationships,Should I be worried about the way my husband speaks to me during arguments?,"Update: I have read each and every comment below, thank you all. It really does help to have an unbiased view on the situation. My parents (and his) are divorced as well, so I’m still learning what a healthy relationship even looks like. I have had a productive conversation with him today about the way he reacts and treats me when he’s angry, and he’s agreed to see a therapist and go to couple counseling. I think if we can get to the root of why the arguments are this way, we can figure out what to do from there. I will keep everything in mind, however, moving forward. I appreciate it! 


I am posting here as I don’t want to say anything negative about my spouse to people in my life, but would still appreciate an outside perspective. My husband (30M) and I (27F) have been together for almost 8 years. We have a pretty good relationship generally and haven’t had any major issues. Recently though, I’ve been reading comments from women online saying how their spouses refuse to ever call them names or say anything terrible about them during an argument, and it has since caused me to reflect on my own relationship dynamic. During everyday life I get spoken to well, but each time we get into an argument, I personally receive the brunt of his frustration via name-calling, lying about things, or threats of divorce/separation. We don’t argue often anymore, but when we do he’s very quick to anger and spends the whole time yelling at me and listing off all of the things I do wrong. I very purposely refrain from raising my voice and only use “I” phrases when expressing my feelings or defending myself, as I would much rather have a constructive conversation instead. I’m not perfect though, and I tend to roll my eyes or stare at the wall during his long-winded ranting. Normally I just move past these arguments and not think much of it, as he has admitted that most of the things he says during an argument is coming solely from anger and it’s not how he truly feels. However, the things he has said to me over the years has gotten a bit worse. During the most recent argument we had, he called me almost every vile name you can think of (f***ing b*tch, c*nt, etc.), and he once again threatened divorce or separation. I’m also a pretty outspoken person and would never allow someone to ever speak to me that way in any other circumstance. However, since he has previously stated that he says things out of anger alone, I brush off these insults. The words he said have been floating in my head though, especially after reading comments from other women stating their spouses would never call them those names. Should I be worried about his behavior or is it a normal part of arguments? I am very conscious about my wording during arguments, so I don’t ever call him names as I would only say things if I truly meant it. Any red flags here I’m not noticing, or am I perhaps the problem during our arguments?

TLDR: My husband calls me names and threatens divorce during our arguments. Is this normal or something I should address him more firmly about?

1l5m9e6,relationships,My (27f) fiancé (27m) is perfect… but I’ve fallen out of love with him.,"
TLDR: I feel my fiancé and I are no longer compatible and he is willing to be with me and change himself just so I don’t leave him. He is perfect in every way but I love him like a friend or brother. 

My fiancé and I have been together 5 years. We met right as Covid hit and ended up quarantining together and haven’t been separated since. We’ve never had much in common to be honest - we have entirely different interests and ways of expressing our emotions but I’ve always just talked it up to opposites attracting. We are known as that couple that has never had a fight.

He is a huge people pleaser and does anything to make me happy. He does everything I want and never offers his own opinions. His mom died when he was very young and his father worked too much to ever get him any help. He still struggles with this daily and I feel like he has been emotionally stunted and stuck at the internal age he was when his mother passed. He sulks rather than expressing himself. Typically the sulking revolves around me doing anything independent of him or my attention being given to anyone else (ex my siblings or cats). He will walk away and sulk in the corner to make me feel guilty.

He does everything for me. I never have to worry about dinner laundry dishes etc. He dotes on me hand and foot and people tell me I’m incredibly lucky. But I find myself when talking about how great or what I love about him I only talk about how much he does for me in my day to day life and how kind and considerate he is. There is no emotional connection. We don’t have things we like to do together. We rarely have sex and when we do it’s because I feel bad it’s been so long and he often gets too anxious about it and has ED issues. I’ve found myself time and time again having to give him pep talks during or I just give up completely and say well “try again later”. It’s not that I don’t think he’s handsome - it’s just gotten to the point where I feel like I’m having sex with a friend rather than a romantic partner.

All of this came to a head when I started a new job about 6 months ago. I have a normal schedule and have met some great friends who I like to hangout with. Previously, i had no friends or time to hangout with others outside of the relationship. He is stuck in a dead end job with shitty hours but has become comfortable with it and won’t try to work upwards to improve his situation.

The real kicker is I met someone at my new job. I’m having serious romantic feelings for him and it’s really hi-lighting what is missing in my current relationship. I’m trying to address all of this before I end up either emotionally cheating or marrying my fiancé and regretting it big-time. I’ve addressed all of this with my fiancé and he is devastated. He wants to change everything about himself so that I won’t leave - and I don’t think that’s fair to him at all. He should be with someone that loves the things he loves and matches his energy. I know he loves me and will settle for a loveless marriage on my end for the sake of not being abandoned.

1hw2lki,relationships,My Wife Will Not Work," Reposing (trying to better adhere to the rules). 

  
My (M 42)  wife (F 38) is a PhD student, which is how we originally met (I had just finished my own PhD). Unfortunately, she’s made zero progress on her dissertation for the past four years. On most days, she spends no time at all working on it.

In fairness, a lot has happened in those four years: we got married, we had our son, her father passed away, and we moved multiple times (including during COVID, when things went remote). Even though we’ve been back near her university for about a year now, she has only gone in a few times. She attributes her struggle to depression, and she also experiences PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder). She won’t take any prescribed medication, preferring supplements and costly hypnotherapy—which, so far, hasn’t seemed to help.

I’ve done my best to support her in terms of childcare. Her mother lived with us for over a year to help, and she’s currently back with us again. We’ve also had full-time nannies, and now our son is in preschool. Despite having these support systems, she still doesn’t put time into her PhD.

Whenever I raise the issue or try to see if there’s a way I can help, she becomes very defensive and angry. Our couples therapist recommended she try just two hours of dissertation work a day, but she’s only managed that once. As of writing this, she hasn’t worked on it at all today, and it’s nearly late afternoon.

I’m covering all our bills right now, which is doable but leaves us with very little financial cushion each month (we’re essentially living paycheck to paycheck because of rent, student loans, etc.). I’m starting to feel resentful—both because I worked very hard to finish my PhD and because my own future plans feel like they’re slipping away under this financial and emotional pressure.

One major concern is that I don’t think I could handle my demanding job and full-time care of our toddler on my own if we were to separate. I’m somewhat dependent on her for childcare—she’s great with our son. If not for our child, though, I suspect I might have walked away by now.

I’m feeling stuck between wanting to support her, worrying about our future, and feeling frustrated at the lack of progress.

Has anyone navigated a similar situation with a partner who’s stalled academically or career-wise due to mental health issues? How can I approach this in a constructive, compassionate way that still addresses my resentment and our financial constraints? Any advice on how to have these conversations without it blowing up would be really appreciated.

A few months ago she met this one guy who clicked with her personality and they have been playing more and more ever since. She has spent upwards of 10 hours on the game with him some days although usually more on the lines of 2-3 hours per day. They mainly play while I’m away at work or late at night so it doesn’t really interfere with our life together but the amount of time they spend together on the game is shocking to me to say the least. 

Things progressed from there and they have moved on to other games like call of duty and baldur’s gate together. They also started texting each other and I have seen her texting him all hours of the day.

At this point, I snooped because I needed to know if anything was going on behind my back. I looked at texts and there was some mild flirting on both sides. Nothing extremely inappropriate though. Both commented on each others looks and there was several comments about how much they enjoyed each other’s company. The pictures sent seemed like normal things like food, interesting places we had gone, and a few selfies. The guy did tell her he thinks he is falling for her but knows nothing could happen. He also sent some poetry that he said he made for her. Knowing her, I could see her vomiting a bit in her mouth over that but her response was more like, “awww, thank you for that.” I could see her probably saying that just to be nice. He also made several comments about how he feels like Lancelot talking to Guineviere and I was Arthur. Really odd in my mind but she didn’t comment back much and I saw several messages with her telling him how much she was in love with me. I know some messages could have been deleted but also have no reason to believe they have. They talk all the time while gaming though, while I’m away at work and also while I’m there. She doesn’t seem to hide much though and tells me when they play and talk.

We’ve talked about my feelings about this several times and every time she acknowledges it, cuts things back, but a week later, everything is back to this same situation. Overall, our lives and our relationship is great though. We get along wonderfully, the spark is still there, we spend time together, and are happy. I just can’t shake the feeling that whatever this is with her gaming friend has either turned into something more or will soon.

She says that she doesn’t want to cut ties with him because their friendship has developed into something extremely important to her. She would if I asked though. I don’t want to be that person that asks or controls her because I feel she would resent me for it and not be happy at all. If I don’t ask her to, I fear this could develop further and even if they don’t go in the direction of a romance, it could still affect me and how I feel. 

A few other important details: This guy lives about 15 hours away, so I’m not worried about physical infidelity.   She has acknowledged to me that he might have developed feelings for her but outside of really enjoying his company, that hasn’t happened on her side. I do play games with her too, but don’t have much time because of work. I think he has some sort of night job, so he can spend a lot of time with her while I’m at work. 

TLDR: My wife is spending a lot of time with a gaming friend who is developing feelings for her. She says it’s not a problem, but I see it differently. I’m not sure what to do. 

  
UPDATE: Thanks for all of the excellent advice everyone. I will plan out some time to talk with her tomorrow and see what we can agree on. The advice here has made me realize that this situation is important to cut off but also that it sounds like I need to make sure her mental well-being is taken care of.

1ln730o,relationships,My wife (27F) and I (30F) can’t decide how to handle one of our friends (31F),"My wife (27F) Jill and I (30F) are part of a friend group that includes one person, Hannah (31F), who is…difficult. Hannah is constantly passive aggressive and makes a lot of “jokes” that demean or put down other people’s accomplishments. At this point we have two regular group activities that my wife and I organize that Hannah participates in (Friday night game nights and tennis a couple times a week) in additional to gatherings for birthdays, holidays, and other one off events that come through. 

One of my best friends had actually stopped coming to tennis because she doesn’t want to have to put up with Hannah. Hannah will almost always come, but then doesn’t actually want to play. She sits on the bench and tries to pull people into conversation whenever they take quick water breaks. If someone doesn’t end up sitting out during our practice time to talk with her, she’ll always complain about it while we wrap up and make passive aggressive comments about this being a social group, not a serious sports team. I’m the organizer for tennis, so I’ve started arranging with people individually instead of in our group text. It’s never been at specific consistent times, so I think Hannah thinks we’ve just stopped playing as regularly. 

Back in December she was called out after saying something rude by another friend, John (29M). She tried to say it was a joke and spent the rest of the evening pouting. The next time she came to tennis, at every single water break told us she had something she just had to get advice on. We (Jill and I) agreed to stay for 10 minutes, which turned into 30 minutes of her trying to get us to agree that John is a terrible person who is targeting her. I finally said that I actually agreed with John, at which point she left. We took a break from both activities for the holidays, and when things resumed she acted like nothing had happened. 

I recently pointed out that something she said about our house was rude in the moment at a recent game night, and she responded by saying she was so sorry, then laying her head on the table for 10 minutes. When I didn’t give her attention because I was finishing setting up dinner (and honestly done with her antics), she said that she was now going to spend the whole night thinking about how she said this rude thing. I said I thought that was a good way to ruin her own night. 

Jill wants to have a sit down talk with her about her behavior to see if it can improve, but having seen how she handled the situation with John, I don’t think she would be open to constructive feedback. At the same time, it’s pretty hard to remove her from our Friday game nights without some kind of conversation considering it’s at the same time and place every week, so there aren’t formal invites.

TLDR: we have one person in a larger friend group that really wrecks the vibe, but my wife and I don’t know how to remove her from our regularly scheduled game night since it’s not something we formally invite people to anymore. My wife wants to have a conversation with her about her behavior, but I don’t think it will help.

1nd0dg5,relationships,I (18f) had sex with my best friend (18f) and now she wants us to forget it ever happened.," Me and my best friend recently had sex. We've been friends for more than 8 years now and have never been intimate before this, though we were both aware about each other's sexual orientations. Yesterday I went to her place (she lives with her parents) to hang out. we stayed up late into the night and around 4 a.m. she told me she wanted to be kissed.

 I asked her: ""by who?"" And she said it didn't matter. I didn't say anything, didn't want to get ahead of myself or force her into anything. We decided to go to bed, laied down next to each other and hugged, untill she asked if I wanted to play with her boobs. I jokingly asked if she was serious, and she said yes. So I got into work.

 (I should note here that i've had lesbian sex before this, and that my parents are very open-minded about homosexuality. However this was my best friend's first time, and she had told me multiple times that her parents didn't support LGBTQ+ at all. I had told her earlier that day that she could do whatever she wanted and that she didn't have to let her parents decide who she is. She agreed, and we dropped the topic.)

 The sex itself was amazing. We had to be quiet, she was clutching her mouth as to not let out any noise, We kissed, switched positions, and even got a bit creative with the technique, but i made sure either she was the one initializing the moves or that she was ready before I made any.

 I'd ask her if she was comfortable and whether she was enjoying the sex, and she'd say yes. she told me she came multiple times, and I don't think she lied, she seemed relaxed and had a genuine smile on her face afterwards, eyes closed. 

We cuddled after we finished. it was already 7 a.m. and she fell asleep quickly after that. I left her a note that said I had to leave, but that i'd see her again with a heart next to it, and went home. I fell asleep and woke up hours later to a text from her.

 She acknowledged she read my note, sent me a heart, and asked how I was doing. I jokingly told her I was doing good, but that my whole body hurt as if I'd just ran a few miles. She laughed, then told me that she was still in shock about the whole thing; followed with a: ""I don't think what we did was right."" I told her it didn't matter if she enjoyed it, and she said she was feeling guilty and thought we shouldn't do it again. I told her that it's okay, we won't do it again, but that she shouldn't worry too much about it, that she was just enjoying the moment and didn't need to feel guilty about anything. She agreed, but said that it didn't feel right and that we should forget it ever happened. I told her i don't think we can ever forget, but we can ignore it if we want to; to which she didn't reply, and changed the topic to talk about a book she was reading.

 This is where i need advice: I'm completely okay with her not wanting to do it again, and feeling like what we did was wrong, specially with how her parents think about the whole thing. I'm not gonna bring up the topic again, or ever make her feel awkward or guilty about not wanting to do it anymore. And while I'm okay with the way things turned out and understand why they turned out this way, I can't help but feel out of place.

 While I can't pinpoint exactly what this feeling is, I know it's not out of spite or feeling betrayed, but rather: ""I don't think we can ever go back to normal after what we did no matter how hard we try to change the subject or ignore the fact that we once kissed, and that's painful.""
I don't know how to feel or proceed, any advice?

**TL;DR: I feel out of place after her suggesting we should forget about the sex. How should I feel or proceed?**

1n6ybxn,relationships,"I(20F) told my bf(20M) of 2 months my deepest, most shameful secret and now he won’t even look me in the eye or talk to me.","My bf (20M) and I (20F) have been together for about 2 months now. We’ve said I love you to each other and he gained my trust enough for us to be sleeping together. I thought that he truly loved me for who I was but with what happened last night, I’m not sure.
Last night, after sex, we were bored and decided to have some deep conversations. We made a list of questions on ChatGPT and had it choose randomly. 

The first random question was “What is the funniest thing that’s happened to you during sex?” And he answered first. I learned more abt his past sex life so I felt comfortable enough to share mine but he didn’t see it the way I thought and asked if I was hiding anything from him. Though I said no, he suspected one thing I could be lying abt was my body count. That, I have not lied abt. It was always 3 people before him. 

But I then told him that if it’s outside of sex itself(so like on call and sending pics and stuff) there were abt 3 in high school. He started to get judgy so I told him that I’m not proud of it either and I basically ruined my life with it bc the last guy that I did stuff with, he took a screenshot of my nudes and kept it saved, that went on to being shown around his friends (the entire American football team) and rumors about me started spreading and I became known as the high school s-word for it. 

He started making comments on my “hyper sexuality” bc most of the times we do it together, I’m the one asking him for it so I also explained to him that after talking with my therapist that I realized my actions and my mindset wasn’t because of a high sex drive but bc of a collective of past traumas that had shaped how I view life and myself in a very obscure way. 

After I told him that that was my most shameful secret he just got up, put his clothes on and left the room without me. I followed him out and I asked why he’s just leaving me after I told him that and he asked me why i didn’t tell him before he asked me to be his gf. I tried to make my point that I couldn’t tell him that yet we were barely getting to know each other and I even asked him if he would’ve still asked me to be his gf if he knew this and he said no. I asked him if he thinks I’m a s-word for that and he said yes. He also started saying that he was dating to marry and if I really cared abt him then I would’ve told him before we became official bc if we get married and if someone who has those photos leaks them somewhere, it’s not only me who’s going to be affected but other people as well. But I told him that I didn’t tell him before we became official bc I didn’t know whether I could trust him with that side of me yet. Yet he keeps saying that I shouldn’t have kept something like that from him and he wouldn’t even hold my hand or treat me like he loved me. He doesn’t say I love you back he just left and said bye and that’s it. 

Was I wrong for not telling him it before he asked me to be his gf? Where am I in the wrong on this? And what should I do about the situation?

TLDR:
I told my bf my deepest and most shameful secret(I had sexual relations with some people in high school and one of them leaked a nude of mine and idk who has or doesn’t have my photos and I’m known as the school s-word) and his feeling did a complete 180 on me.

1mt75if,relationships,My brother M27 and his gf F29 telling everybody I went “missing” after 24 hours,"
I’m F/29 and my brother M/27 is dating my longtime friend/nail tech F/29. Recently she’s been pushing to hang out a lot, but I’ve been busy house hunting every day with my partner M/37. I told both her and my brother that once the listings are done, I’ll have time.

After my last appointment, she asked again to hang out. I didn’t answer because I was swamped. Instead of dropping it, she had my brother send me an old video “to get my attention.” I ignored that too.

Within 24 hours, things spiraled. My brother called me, called my partner, and his girlfriend started messaging me directly saying she was “worried” I was missing. She even messaged one of our mutual friends (28F), asking if she knew where I was. Then she texted me asking if I “jokingly hate her.”

The mutual friend told her this is normal for me — I go ghost when I’m busy. My partner is also terrible with his phone, which my brother and his girlfriend both know. But the girlfriend still panicked, messaged my friend again 12 hours later around 8:30am asking for my location, and even said she and my brother were thinking about showing up at the house my partner and I share to “check on me.”

I finally answered a couple hours later and told them I was fine. My brother said they were “worried” because I was “missing” for 24 hours. I reminded him he’s known me for his entire life and I’ve gone “missing” many times, sometimes for days, even weeks. Everyone in my family knows this including him and doesn’t panic — my mom would have literally laughed if he told her. Hence why my mom was the one person that they didn’t contact when I speak to her the most. 

What bothers me is my brother trying to spin it like everyone (including our mutual friend) was stressed, when screenshots show that friend told them clearly this is normal for me.

So — how do I handle this? To me, it feels like his girlfriend is manufacturing drama, exaggerating concern, and trying to control the narrative. But my brother is fully buying into it. Am I being gaslit here or overreacting?

Now she refuses to go back home until homeboy moves out. I'm trying to be a good boyfriend and let her stay with me for a while, but ""a while"" is starting to feel permanent.

1im6a22,relationships,I'm thinking about ending a 20 year friendship over text,"TLDR: It turned out that my best friend of 20 years has never been my friend at all, and has sabotaged a lot of my relationships. Is she owed a face to face meeting to end things? Also advice on breaking up with toxic people.



I (37f) have been best friends with Tasha (39f) for 20 years. We met in college, we were the Maid of Honor in each others weddings. I thought that we were going to be friends until death.

The thing is that I've found out recently that she has never actually been my friend. It's come out that she had sabotaged my life personally and professionally, with great intention, for the last 20 years. It started to come out when I ran into an ex-bf ""Joe"" (41m). He is happily settled with a wife (Mia 38f) and kids the same age as my own. Joe and my husband Rick (40m) hit it off and Mia is really sweet. We dated for a few months 17 years ago, no one has any feelings. We've been seeing the couple for about 6 months and they met Tasha. After Mia (38f) approached me and said she wanted to tell me something. She said that 17 years ago Tasha told Joe that I was cheating on him (we had just agreed to be exclusive at the time). It caused a fight that led to our breakup (he approached me in a very verbally aggressive way and I reacted poorly because we were young and stupid). Mia said that Joe realized later that what Tasha said made no sense, but that he felt it was too late to approach me.

Mia only brought this up because when I walked away Tasha started talking about me with backhanded compliments. Apparently she told Mia that I was doing great considering my head injury (I had an accident at work but it only caused a minor concussion). Tasha also implied that my husband and I were swingers, so they needed to be careful. (If you live that lifestyle that's your business, but we are not into that AT ALL.)

I was shocked. The thing is that situations like this have happened in the past. My first instinct was to immediately talk to Tasha. These situations always end one of a few ways. One, Tasha vehemently denying everything and me apologizing to Tasha for the misunderstanding. Two, Tasha hysterically crying and apologizing in a very public place (she knows I hate drama and public scenes) and I end up apologizing. Three, Tasha turning it around and bringing up something that I said that hurt her, so I end up apologizing.

I've been seeing a therapist for almost 2 years, and doing a lot of work on myself, so I guess I reacted differently. (my self-esteem is a lot better) I went to my husband and we started really comparing notes. I also started talking to other people that this has happened with in the past. The pattern and similarities are really disturbing; enough that I no longer have any doubt that they are true.

I know that the friendship with Tasha never really existed. It's also made me reframe some of the behaviors that Tasha has displayed in the past. She is a big believer in revenge, but she has always framed it as ""having no choice"" or ""trying to do the right thing"". For example she once found out her bf was cheating on her with another girl, Jen, who had NO idea Tasha existed. Later someone reported that  Jen was smoking pot, causing Jen to lose her scholarship and have to leave school. Years later Tasha admitted it had been her, and when I told her that was messed up she framed it as ""trying to do the right thing and be honorable"" and that I was the one with the skewed moral compass. (Yes, I apologized to her).

I don't know what to do. This girl does not have a place in my life. I want her gone, but I'm also afraid of her reaction. She's been pressuring me to hang out, and I've been putting her off. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about this? Part of me wants to send her a text and be done with it, but I know that's kind of messed up after 20 years. I just feel like she's stolen enough of my time.

I stay home with the baby and he goes to work. we’ve been together almost 5 years, married on 3/29/24, i got pregnant shortly after

my husband is a gamer, which all my ex’s have been it’s really no big deal to me. He doesn’t really have a set schedule but usually he’ll leave the house around 10 and be home around 5-6. immediately after getting home, he’ll usually smoke and start playing games. Dinner is always at 7, half the time he eats in his game room, and i’ll eat at the table and feed the baby, then bath, and bed time at 8. he doesn’t really interact with our daughter. i have to bring her to him to say goodnight while hes playing. he’s off on weekends and will stay up playing games. aAlthough on sundays he’ll hang out with us for about 4 hours, nap and get on games. on tuesdays we watch two episodes of our anime. if i’m ever tired of sitting at home, i can go to work with him and hang out in his office, but it’s not like he really interacts with our daughter unless his coworkers are. i’m just getting exhausted never getting a break longer than 15 minutes, and that’s if i ask and he usually complains. i haven’t been able to sleep past 7 for 6 months, he’s changed maybe 5 diapers, he doesn’t feed her. i feel like he’s missing out on so much and he doesn’t care

i’m just not sure if this is normal? before we had the baby we’d spend a decent of time together, after work we’d watch our shows everynight, and he’d just play games in his spare time

Edit to Add:
UPDATE
i ended up talking to him yesterday when we went to get groceries and he had a literal meltdown and screamed for like 10 minutes and i just didn’t say anything and let him calm himself down, and then he told me how depressed he’s been. but he’s gonna bring that up with his therapist. he spent all day with us, and then got on games after the baby was asleep. we’ll see how today goes 🤷🏼‍♀️

tl/dr  my husband used to spend time with me, i had a baby and he basically only goes to work and play games, he barely interacts with us. He’s missing out on so much and i have no idea how to tell him. what do i even say?

A couple days after that post, on November 1st my family had a Halloween party. We attended as we have been staying with my parents. It was fun, it was going good. I allowed myself to just relax, had a few drinks which I don’t often. I “let loose”. This all came crumbling down though when my gf made a comment/joke about getting married. She asked “Do you want to marry me?” I said “Yes!” She asked “so when are we getting married?” I said “When we get married!” she responded “So you don’t want to marry me” I responded “That’s not what I’m saying” and then it got quiet. Now mind you, this was a few hours into the party, after we had a good bit to drink. So it wasn’t really the time or place to have a serious conversation about our future marriage.

Later we are in our room, to escape the party for a bit. She says sorry. I tell her thank you. She says something about how it was just joke. I tell her that the joke isn’t really funny given we’ve had all of these conversations regarding issues we’ve been having, how before we even really think about getting married I’d like for us to be out of my parents house again. She says she wishes joking about marriage wasn’t a stressor. I said that it isn’t just about the marriage, it’s about the accusation that I don’t want to. When I’ve been trying so hard to get us to a point where we have our own place, where I can afford a ring, where we have finances to plan a wedding. And know we are having a good foundation for our shared future. And the fact I reassure her nearly every week. I do so many things to show her I love her, care about her, and want a future. So when she says things like that, I feel unheard in how much I am struggle to carry all of this by myself.

The rest of the convo is a bit of a blur (alcohol and it being late doesn’t help), but it turns into a fight. It went on for about 2 hours. Which really sucks, because I’ve said time and time again I’m really uncomfortable having these conversations while we’ve had drinks and when it’s late. But nonetheless there we are.

I tell her that I don’t want to get married until I feel like I can depend on her. She says that I can, that she listens to me when I talk about work. I tell her that I mean like seriously depend on her, like what if I lose my job? What if I get deathly ill? I want to feel like we aren’t totally fucked, because she will be able to be there for us. I tell her about how we were supposed to have a check-in mid-October, to discuss her progress on things we had talked about fixing in July to keep the relationship going. That we never had that check-in, and it is past that but she hasn’t done these things. I told her I was glad that our conflicts had become less, but that these things were still not being met. She immediately got defensive and said “so how long were you going to wait to talk to me about this if I didn’t joke about marriage?” I said “not long at all, I was getting my thoughts together, and deciding when we should sit down and talk. October just ended.” She ends up telling me about how she has looked into a program at our old university and how she has had two phone calls with them that led nowhere. I was aware of one of these. I asked if she had ordered her transcript and applied to FAFSA like we talked about. She said no. She said it’s all confusing and she doesn’t know what to do. That it’s “hard.” I tell her “You can ask for help when you starting do it and I’ll help. you know when I was looking at going for my masters recently, I applied to both FAFSA and got my transcript in one day. It isn’t hard too hard.” she then brings up us having different capacities.

It some how derails and we are talking about the past. It’s hard to remember all that was said or how we got there. But I do remember telling her how it’s hard to trust her, because she hasn’t done these things, and because right before her psychosis this year, she admitted to me, that early in our relationship she had been posting nudes on a secret Snapchat to try and sell them, browsed Tinder, and apparently had her coworkers thinking I was abusive, that we were in an open relationship, etc. She justified the nudes by saying she was trying to make us money (which we didn't need to do, as I had a teaching job at this time. Also I don't have an issue with some posting nudes online, it's that we had talked about it early on, as she used to do it, and I told her I just didn't want the one's she sent me to be the same one's she posted, because I wanted to feel special, and then SHE decided she didn't want to do it anymore), and that she only did it like once a month, and didn’t do it for that long. And also that it never came up. As if I was supposed to know and ask?? She didn’t respond to the Tinder thing. She also said she didn’t know why her coworkers thought that of me, that she always told them how great I was. She said she speculates it’s because they thought it was odd she had a job and needed to work while I had a teaching job. I told her that, the point is she kept that all from me, while I took my first “grown up job” to try and start building our future, and she was doing all of that, and kept it from me for years. She said she was super supportive of me during that time.

We end up back to the original topic of what we had agreed she would do. I said something about how she has had 3 and a half months to make real progress and figure these things out, and she has done less than what I managed to do in a single morning. She got upset and she said very angrily “so what you want me to get my transcript, apply for FAFSA, and start applying??” I said “well yeah, that’s what we agreed to. It was either that or find another job.” She was upset that I didn’t see her having a phone call with a university about a program as enough. She said she needed me to see that as a good step. I said it was a good step, but it isn’t what we agreed to by this point. She was upset and said something about “so the conflict being less isn’t good? Because I haven’t done this?” I said “No I’ve said the conflict being less is good, it’s just that this was an important part of what we agreed to.” I had said several times in the conversation I was happy about that. I also around this point reminded her what I said last time we had these talks, which is that if she didn't want to go back to school or get a better job, that it was fine, we would just be wanting different things in life, and I wouldn't hate her for that, I would still love her, we would just not be compatible which happens sometimes. She stated multiple times this is what she wants, this is what she wants to do.

Honestly, this whole thing for me is in fragments. I remember points at which she kept trying to change why we almost broke up in the past. She tried to say she is worried to talk to me because I’ll just “break up” with her. And I had to tell her the reason we have almost broke up, was the first time, it was because I told her I got tremors and heart rate spikes when I felt like we were going to have conflict and she belittled me for it. The second time it was because she continuously ran over my boundaries, and had a whole meltdown that started from her tripping and falling when hanging out with family and being embarrassed. Which then went from me supporting her for being embarrassed and trying to make her feel better, to somehow being accusations that I didn’t love her, and she spiraled for like 4 hours, until nearly 5 AM, threatened to not go to my nephews birthday party with me the next day because I told her I think it’d be best if we continued talking about it in the morning, since we were both tired and have had a few drinks. Which she refused to do, and she blew up my phone and criticized my therapy for “changing me.” These weren’t light hearted moments for me, these weren’t just any conversation leading me to think it may be best for us to part ways. This is the second time she has tried to reframe these scenarios as me casually wanting to leave. Instead of what they truly were, which was her pushing me as far as I could go. She also said it’s my fault she has the job she has. That I “made her take it.” Because I’m the one who found it, and told her to apply to there, to get out of the other job that was making her absolutely miserable. Like that job made her seriously depressed. And that we had agreed it was something she could do while she figured something more long term out. But I never made her take it, I suggested it because the other job made me very worried for her and her mental health.

I had 5 heart rate notifications from my Apple Watch from the stress of this conversation. By the end things had settled, she apologized for not doing more, and asked me to promise I wouldn’t break up with her the next day, the next week, and this year. The party was over and everyone had gone to bed, so I missed out on seeing my aunts for longer as they left before we even woke up the next day.

Since then, I’ve just been feeling very confused. I feel sad, angry, confused, and kind of numb. I feel like I don’t remember everything, so if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry.

I just don’t really know what to think. Part of me really feels like this is the end. I just felt like all of our issues are not being dealt with, and that every issue we’ve had, I have to fight against her rewriting what happened. It’s just so confusing. I love her, I really do, so my heart hurts, but I just feel like things shouldn't be this hard. She's been extremely kind since this conversation, and she submitted to get her transcript. But yeah I just don't know. I am really just exhausted of things being like this, and I really wish we didn't have to have an argument for something to happen.

TLDR: Update from my last post. We had a chat, under not good circumstances. I feel very confused and lost. I think maybe it’s just time to throw in the towel. Is this something that can be fixed?

1o03mll,relationships,My (35F) mother (64F) took care of me when I was sick.,"Several months ago I had some serious health issues. I had a seizure and collapsed at home, and was taken to the hospital. I wasn't able to work when I was discharged a day and lost my job. My mom lives in a different state, but when I wasn't really improving she came to stay with my husband and I. This included helping with the bills and the housekeeping, and then on one really bad night I couldn't control my muscles or body temperature. My mom had to undress and bathe me, and then call another ambulance for me, while I had 4 more seizures. I was released after 4 days, they found brain bleeding and lesions.

After all this and I was finally home and starting to recover, I feel deeply embarrassed about everything. I'm a fully grown adult who couldn't control her body, and had her mom not only see her naked, but bathe her. I guess I'm just looking for some perspective from parents on here, would you think this was a big deal? Should I bring it up to her and apologize if I made her uncomfortable?

  
TL:DR I had to be physically cared for by my mother while I was ill and I'm feeling ashamed about it. 


Update: You all helped me see I was being ridiculous, and possibly very hormonal. I know for sure she's seen me do worse things, like when I found the bottle of Smirnoff Apple Vodka and drank it all in High School. I love my mom very much and am grateful to her and we're taking a girls trip to Costa Rica this summer, and hopefully there are no bath repeats.",239,0.94,239,0,255.0,16.0,102,1759806430.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o03mll/my_35f_mother_64f_took_care_of_me_when_i_was_sick/,False,True
1mzbgd1,relationships,"My [26F] LDR boyfriend [32M] seemed upset I didn’t buy him a birthday gift, even though he got me nothing. Is this a red flag?","Hi Reddit, I need some outside perspective.

I’ve been in a long-distance relationship for a year now. Our birthdays are a month apart. Mine came first when we had only been dating for 3 months. I didn’t expect a gift at all (he didn’t have money), I just wanted him to be the first to wish me happy birthday. He did exactly that—set an alarm for midnight, and I was honestly really happy with that.

Then his birthday came the following month. For a whole month before, he kept bringing up this one item he really wanted but couldn’t afford. I just listened because my financial situation has been rough (I’m the breadwinner of my family since my dad left us with debt, and money has been very tight).

On his birthday, I wished him happy birthday. His reaction felt kind of… disappointed. Two days later, he asked me directly, “So what are you going to give me for my birthday?” I was shocked and said I didn’t know. Then he sent me a link about a girl who bought her boyfriend an expensive gift and said, “She bought her boyfriend something expensive, but my girlfriend didn’t even get me something cheap.”

That really hurt. I reminded him that I didn’t get anything on my birthday either, and I never demanded anything. I could’ve compared him to my exes who gave me gifts without asking, but I never did, because I don’t care about that.

When I told him maybe he should just date someone richer, he got mad and said, “I don’t need material things.” But it feels like he does—otherwise, why bring it up and compare me to other girlfriends? Meanwhile, he still relies on his parents and even gets gifts from them, while I get nothing and carry all my family responsibilities.

Now I can’t shake the thought: is he just trying to use me financially in the long run? Because honestly, the item he wanted was actually quite expensive in my country’s currency.

TL;DR: My LDR boyfriend didn’t give me anything on my birthday (which was fine), but when his came around, he was disappointed I didn’t buy him a gift and compared me to girlfriends who spend big on their boyfriends. I’m struggling financially, while he still relies on his parents. Is this a red flag that he might try to use me?

1l2now3,relationships,"I agreed to live with my gf (20F) of 6 months, but now she’s pushing for a $4K NYC apartment and I’m (21M), jobless, and overwhelmed","Before I graduated this May, my gf of 6 months who is an international student from China and I agreed to live together in NYC for her next school year. I agreed but said I'd need a full-time software engineering job first, and if I don't find one right away I'll part-time being a Server or something else to cover rent. She was excited and started apartment hunting right away and imagining our life together.

Now it's June and she's back in China for the summer, and found a corner-view apartment for around 4.2k, which she said is a great deal. Her mom would cover her half of rent, and I'd cover mine, but I don't have a job yet, and no family support. I've been applying 50-100 jobs per day, with some interviews in progress. I told her I'd part-time if needed, but realistically that's hard to balance while improving my skills for job hunting.

When I hesitated, she said the apartment she just found would be gone soon and wanted to immediately sign the lease. I told her I want to live with her but I'm sure... what if I get a job outside NYC? The tech market is bad for entry level rn and I'd take up any job offered. Signing now could mean paying rent without even living there. She got upset and sad I was only thinking of myself and not about where she'd live if we don't get this place. But she does have friends who are willing to live with her.

She said:

“You say you’ve considered me, but your consideration is limited to what *you* think. That’s not really considering me — you’ve put me in a position where everything revolves around you.”

“I feel like I’ve already compromised. My mom is covering the guarantor fee, and I’m helping you job hunt — but you still can’t make this decision. You’re not thinking about me enough.”

She then said we either sign now or she'll live with a friend and rethink our relationship. It it me hard. I realized: it feels like this relationship only survives if we're *not* long-distance and living together. She said if I truly cared, I'd just keep job searching until I find a role in NYC, and reject non-NYC roles. She even said on call, with her family on the background able to hear the convo, ""Never dating a poor guy again."" I told her I'm not poor, my family just doesn't support paying for my rent if we already have a house here, and that I can do whatever I want once I get a job.

I caved in and said I'd work part-time to cover rent while job hunting, and she'd help with apps. But I told her this means I can't afford to treat her to the lifestyle she likes (gifts, nice restaurants, etc) until I get a tech job, since the part-time job will only be enough to cover rent.

I also proposed an alternative: she lives with her friend this year, I stay with my family in NYC, work part-time with fewer hours, and once I get an offer, I'll move-in nearby, renting a cheaper studio so we'd be very close. She said she's ""fine"" with it but said would still be very disappointed in this relationship, saying that I'm not prioritizing on solving the issue by just working more to live with her.

I'll be doing what she wants, but honestly I feel really uneasy. Not just because of pressure, but beacause when things go wrong, she always makes it my fault. I'm starting to feel like I'm sacrificing my own career, stability, and self-worth just to hold things together.

How do I move forward with this without wrecking my career or completely losing myself... I've tried talking to her about this but I may be too narrow in my thinking to convey properly to her, how can I improve our current relationship situation?

edit: The house got signed by someone else, and now she's blaming me for being too slow on making a choice that we ""already decided"" to go forward with. And now, she can't live in her ideal apartment, but I told her I'll help her search, and she said ""good luck finding one that is as good as this one, and just as cheap"".

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for their insight and support. It saddens me to know that there are others who have gone through such a similar experience, but I am grateful to know that we are not alone.

After posting my initial post, I ended up asking my boyfriend to meet so we could break up. At the time, I was insistent on leaving, but was still open to hearing his side. When we met up, he immediately started crying and apologizing. Wanting to keep things short and concise, I expressed to him that this relationship was not healthy for either one of us, and that we were incompatible in ways that were unsustainable for the long-term. He was initially in denial, saying that everything is fixable, but soon after he agreed that we should end things. 

As we were thanking each other for the good memories, he suddenly said that ""he was the one breaking up with me"", not that I was breaking up with him. In the past, he had expressed how he was never the one who was dumped in his other relationships and that he always ended things first; hearing him try to clarify that he was breaking up with me was a bit confusing, considering that I was the one who brought it up, and that I thought it was mutually agreed upon. In all honesty, it only clarified to me that the relationship ending was for the better, if he focused so much on the logistics of being ""the one to end things"".

We have been in no-contact since, and I am working towards healing from what I have experienced throughout our 2 years together. While I have found myself missing the relationship as the breakup is still new, I've felt a sense of relief and happiness towards working on myself and no longer having to cry because of him.

  
Thank you to everyone for reading and for your help. To anyone else in a similar situation, please know that you are not alone. 

TLDR: Broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years after signs of incompatibility and unsustainability. As we were breaking up, he tried clarifying to me that he was the one breaking up with me, and not me breaking up with him. Previously, he had stated how he was the one who ended things first in his past relationships, so for him to say that again while we were breaking up was a bit off-putting.

1mbwgte,relationships,UPDATE: it got worse. How do I [25F] tell my sister [28F] to stop asking me to do little things for her.,"TLDR: well she gave me a dog and now I couldnt be in a worse mental state. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/yvKgJ3nGLE

Hello, first I’d like to say thank you to all the comments both offering advices and calling me out on my inability to say no. I don’t want to go into a tangent about the reasoning behind it but it’s definitely a mixture of both my personality and an asian-culture background that led to me being unable to deny these things most of the time.

And some of you are very correct, yes. Most of the time it’s a lot quicker if I just suck it up and do it rather than having an extended “No YOU do it” battle with my sister. I’m also the type to write up a whole mental script of reasonings on the WHYs of my refusal.

All and all, it’s very unhealthy for my mental health and I’m trying to improve myself. I tried to regulate my own thoughts and take up on a lot of advices of not having to explain myself, or the fact that the lengthened debate worth saving me this discussion further down the line. Just say no more often, even if it’s uncomfortable. 

And I thought I was finally getting some control back on my autonomy when, well, she gifted me a dog.

My birthday was a couple of days ago and lo and behold theres a puppy inside the box when I opened it, surrounded by all my friends and family. And I… couldn’t be any worse of a despair. 

I do NOT want a dog. i’ve LOUDLY AND REPEATEDLY stated that I do not want a dog. Not because I dont like dogs. I love them, back when i was living separately I dogsat for my neighbor also daily and actually enjoyed. Thing is taking care of a dog is a LOT of work. Especially a new puppy with potty train and all. And my household being in the state it is I know from MILES away that I’ll end up being the caretaker. And i dont want it. I’m not in a place or state where I would even want to adopt one. Eventually maybe, but not NOW. And I’ve stated this multiple times, not just to her but to my mother who we’re living with as well.

And they gave me a dog anyway. It was a surprise but everyone other than myself knew. And I felt so betrayed. I’ve never felt so much despair in my life. Of course my sister wouldnt have my back but I thought my mother would. When I confronted her about it she said ‘she knew’ but ‘she’ll help, so don’t worry about it.’

But the thing is i’ll be the main caregiver regardless. Im basically taking up 95% of everything. Im the one who’s doing the actual researches on puppy care, potty train, monitoring her behavior and rushing her to the pad like every 2 hours for potty check ups. Im the one feeding, cleaning, even midnight checkups. The pup whines nonstop at night (and i know it’s a mixture of new home anxiousness and potty needs) and I’m the one who check up on it. I felt like I havent slept for a days. My mom’s there but she mostly looked after it only when I desperately need some sleep and black out. And now the pup needs the vet and of course my sister blankly told me to take her to the vet (oh and look up a good place so you can take her for annual shots too). 

And I’m so angry because i literally cant say ‘no’ to this pup coming into my life. I feel like I was doing so well improving bit by bit and my sister just crashed me with a commitment I cant even say no to. I feel like im losing my mind. Ive been crying and having meltdown, feeling spiteful every morning after pulling allnighters almost everynight. Then by afternoon i’d think it’s not so bad, the pup’s cute, only to have meltdown again the next morning. 

It’s almost like that analogy of ‘when a man does the bare minimum and get all the praises’ only replace the ‘man’ with my sister and me trying to convince myself ‘well at least she helped’ but it’s barely 5%. Barely. 

I don’t know what to do. I cant just get rid of it. Sometimes i wish i can just disappear. ",237,0.87,237,0,279.0,42.0,21,1753746923.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mbwgte/update_it_got_worse_how_do_i_25f_tell_my_sister/,False,True
1oefwi6,relationships,My (30F) boyfriend (28M) doesnt have a job and just got kicked out. Im concerned about him staying at mine. What should I do?,"Hey humans, I need perspective. Help a friend out. I (30F) have been dating a guy (28M) for two years.

At the beginning of our relationship I was struck by the depth of our conversations, his (verbal) support of my painting, and how he turned his life around (gave up drugs and alcohol 3 years ago). He took practical steps to show up for me—changed the litter box for my cats, took the recycling out, took my car to get the tires rotated. In the past I dated guys who talked a big game, but never did anything, so I felt so hopeful.

(For extra context, both of my parents are mentally ill drug addicts so there’s lots of pain there and kinda… hope for care? Which I know I need therapy for). 

Anyway, while we’ve been together I squared away my first year of a social work masters program and it was the hardest thing Ive ever done. In the meantime, he lost his job 8 months ago and has been playing music on the weekends to scrape by. I told him the high risk of that (lack of savings, etc) was making me nervous. He also really *wasnt* scraping by bc he didnt have enough money for food… so I started paying. Now I buy almost all of our groceries, and Ive been pleading with him to get a more secure job in addition to music… just a bookstore or something 2 days a week! (or something). 

Anyway he wont. He is working really hard to make enough money with music, but he wont get another job. And yesterday he got asked to leave his living situation so… He needs somewhere to land. He’s not from this town, so there aren’t a ton of options. I want to be a good partner and show up, but my nervous system is terrified. 

More context: He was asked to leave bc his landlord wanted to move his daughter &amp; her fam into the property. He never missed a rent payment. 

He did say he may have found something for work this week, and with losing his housing maybe he’ll be more open to change? 

When I question him about the situation I feel like our conversation always ends up with my “trauma.” ie: clearly Im having a big reaction bc I have trauma and it’s not fair to him bc Im not seeing all he does for me.

On top of all of it the uncertainty and anxiety makes me heartbroken bc Im yearning for a “forever home” with someone. 

Extra context: before he was asked to leave his place, he was spending most nights at mine anyways. But, it feels different if he were to not have a place of his own.  

My question is: If I were a friend, what would you advise me to do? Is it amoral to tell him he cant stay with me? (or maybe to stay with not just me? me part time and his moms part time?) If he does stay here, is there anything I can do to stay sane? (make a chore chart, or something? and have a timeline?). If Im telling him he cant move in… what should I tell him yo do? Im open to the thoughts

1jg1gdm,relationships,My husband keeps interrupting and answering questions for me in front of our friends,"When I have gathering with common friends that are married, my husband (M48) usually interrupts me (F45) when my friends are asking about my adventure or my life in general.

My husband does not do much sports and he does not have many activities or interests other than watching cooking shows and a couple other shows in YouTube. He does not have a lot of common interests with men. He likes to mingle with women because he likes to cook.

The problem is when my girl friends or friends are asking me about my adventures or even just my regular life. My husband will interrupt me answering and talks about my adventure (which he did not participate in) and about my life in front of me.

For example: I love climbing and I finally completed some big goal climbs. I was mingling in a party and a friend asked me how was my climb. My husband (who does not climb or exercise) answers it for me and said that the climb is ""Easy"". My friend even said to him in surprise that he thought my husband does not climb. My husband confidently says Yes he does not climb and he continues talking without even realizing that it might be a hint. I then leave the conversation. Not only he interrupt but he also undermine my big goal and training for the past 2 - 3 years.

It's also about regular daily life such as: kids activities, restaurants that I tried, etc. My girl friend visits and ask me about what do I cook. My husband interrupted me and says I don't go to kitchen. I cook breakfast for my kids everyday. I just don't cook for him, because no matter what he only eat what he cooks. He is very picky.

I told my husband about this multiple times. He says Sorry but he keeps repeating this.

From my experience, my husband will never change. It is me who always need to change.

He is not very self aware either. I told him to find more hobbies so he can relate and talk with more people, but according to him he has a lot of hobbies. I don't tell him that it is related to this issue because then he will get defensive.

Me giving him an eye or hand signal, he won't notice or understand. I mean there are other things when I literally told him on the moment ""Please do not do this"" and he will still do it. He will say later that he misheard or misunderstand.

I can not come up with any solution other than I should avoid going to party with common friends with him. What is the point of going to a party if I am going to be hurt or pissed afterward. I am thinking I can try to tell him that we rotate if there is friend gathering. I am just not sure what to tell our friends.

Anyone experience this? Any other tips?

1iudrxw,relationships,I (34F) found out my partner (38M) has engagement ring for over a year - he threw it at my me during a heated argument,"I’ve been with my partner for over seven years. We met overseas, moved to Australia, travel together and bought a house. While it does feel like we are married, I want to actually get married - so does he (apparently). We have talked about eloping or having something small, but I feel that I am always the one bringing it up and thinking about what we could do. It's a similar trend with buying a house or having kids. He is a libra and extremely indecisive. He says he loves me, wants to spend my life with me (I mean he has committed in many different ways e.g. moving half way around the world and getting his PR)

So... around six months ago, I made an intentional decision to stop mentioning marriage/kids to see if he would initiate the conversations. He never did. We started couples counselling, and things slowly seemed to be improving. He was opening up about his fears and anxieties. Aware about how important these things were for him, and that he wanted them as well. Then, the night before our third session, we had a small fight where he got super defensive over the fact that I called him ""dismissive."" It blew up, and he refused to go to the session because he ""didn't feel like it.""

I was already frustrated and emotionally exhausted. And after finding out it still cost me $300 for the session and the fact that he wasn't willing to put in the work, I had a very frank argument with him. In the heat of the moment, I did say things that I regretted - e.g. we should just sell the house and that I’d move to a different city. And then, out of nowhere, he threw an engagement ring box at my face and told me to sell that too. I didn’t even get a chance to process it all - he immediately broke down. Blaming himself. Saying he overthinks everything and fears making the wrong plans for the proposal. And that he is a terrible partner. I ended up comforting him for the rest of the night. But later, when I was alone, I completely broke down as I found out he has had the ring for over a year - but he quite easily made the decision to throw it at my face during an argument.

It’s been two weeks. While he is extremely sad and regrets what happened, I feel like I am not getting much action from him. He said he’d see a therapist, but he hasn’t. I'm still initiating the hard conversations and he shuts down when asked questions around how he is feeling and where he sees us/ our future. I feel tired and basically have my foot out the door at this point. It also hurts knowing he spent over a year stressing about proposing, only to throw it all away in one moment. He shows strong characteristics of a fearful avoidant, and I want to support him where I can. He says he will make it up. How long do I wait around for this?

# TL;DR:

Been with my partner 7+ years. It feels like we're married at this point but he's not initiated the proposal/ marriage - even though we both have said we want to. During a fight, he threw an engagement ring at my face and told me to sell it, which I found out he has had for over a year. Then broke down, saying he overthinks everything/ he is a terrible person and needs help but doesn't actually do anything about it. I ended up comforting him, but I feel exhausted and unsupported. It feels like the same cycle, the resentment is building and I don’t know how to move forward.",233,0.79,233,0,317.0,84.0,122,1740097098.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iudrxw/i_34f_found_out_my_partner_38m_has_engagement/,False,True
1ktt6rc,relationships,My [39F] husband [42M] offered to leave for the peace of mind of everyone,"Sorry for being long, I really need some advice!

So husband and I are married for 15 years and have 2 kids [12F and 10M]. In the past 2 years we have been dealing with daughter's mental health issues - extreme anxiety, self harm and threatening suicide. She was treated with medication and psychiatric help for a year and her situation slowly improved. Throughout the process, although we had counseling, he was always in a mindset of ""why can't she just get over it"". Like he was mad at her for being this way.

In the past month she's having a kind of relapse specifically regarding school tests anxiety. Every other day she's crying, yelling at us and can't handle the stress. I'm working with her school but at home it's still hard. Anyway a week ago she had a breakdown and yelled/cried about how much she hates him, that all he does is put her down, that she never want to see him again etc. 
Now it's been a week and they didn't speak, they ignore each other. He was silent, frustrated and angry all week. He's also mad at her for saying all that and he also listens to my talks with her and gets angry with her whining while not doing anything to improve her situation (like she will scroll TikTok all day and they remember she has a test tomorrow and start breaking down at 9 PM). 
Here's where I question our marriage: 
I talked with him today about how is he going to fix his relationship with her. 
His response was that he's not going to do fix it. When I asked what is his solution he said to send her away to a boarding school (in my country that is highly unacceptable) or that he can ""leave and just give you my paycheck and you can all live in peace"". 

I don't know what to do. 
He loves me. He loves our boy. I don't think he loves our daughter right now. 
Im here wondering for the first time in 15 years if my kids will be better without this energy, even if I lose my partner that I love. 
Is my marriage already over?

1hks6tx,relationships,Girlfriend's Anxiety Is Weighing On Me,"WARNING: Long post but I'm at my wits end with a long relationship so I appreciate the help!

TLDR: My girlfriend has severe anxiety and it's ruining our relationship as we cannot have a discussion about important things without her crying or blaming me. I'm now considering breaking up with her as I do not feel the wish anymore to move in with her or get married (both of which she is pushing for quite strongly). I lost confindence in us working out. Should I end it? 

I 'M29' have been dating my GF 'F26' for 6 years. It's been going really well for a long time and I love her family and friend circle. We are approaching moving in together and as I haven't been looking forward to it, I started thinking of what is not working between us and why I would rather postpone a sharing a flat.

As a big disclaimer: My girlfriend has strong anxiety has been on and off meds previously and is seeing a therapist regularly. When I do things that she does not like (i.e. travel without her) it got so bad that she hurt herself.

Our relationship is very nice in large parts but I noticed (albeit people have been telling me for a long time) that it's conditional to doing exactly what she wants. 

This could be regarding what time we are going home from drinks with friends for example. Unfortunately, there is always being tired, headache, or something else if I ask to stay a bit longer. If I don't abide, I'm bad for not considering her and hearing her wishes. This is true for anything we do.

Another part is that she is controlling and people have mentioned this to me multiple times. If I'm hanging out with friends or family (this is rare, not even 1x a month) there is a significant amount of texts coming from her and if I don't answer them timely, I will hear ""you are ignoring me"", ""you don't want to communicate"" but I really just want to put my phone away for an hour or two and hang out with a friend or a family member. This has been weighing on me a lot as she will bring up incidences where I haven't done what she says months after it happened.

This became quite extreme recently when I had to leave for a work trip she was not happy with nd she got so upset that she started hurting herself in front of me and could not stop doing so for hours.

I truly started not bringing things up that bother me because I know she'll just cry and manipulate our discussion so that it ends with me apologizing. Any issue/event will be mentioned by her so often that it can eat up entire weekends. I'm a very outspoken, open person so this is obviously frightening to see. I can almost feel that I'm feeding her anxiety by just being blackmailed by her crying and sandbagging discussions.

A further point that I'm strugling with a lot is that I cannot confide in her anymore. I cannot tell her much about things that hurt me or bother me that are not concering her like coworkers, family or simply tell her about something amazing that happened to me (gift from parents, promotion at work, nice bonus) as she will either become overestimulated or jealous (mind you she is from an insanely wealthy background and I'm not).

There are just so many roadblocks and I'm truly at my wits end if I should not just break things off. I just cannot handle her anxiety anymore as I feel like it will never be truly ok and that she will just create a new problem.",230,1.0,230,0,,,111,1734973446.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hks6tx/girlfriends_anxiety_is_weighing_on_me/,False,True
1i1yepo,relationships,"I (44m) am struggling to appropriately deal with my parents' (73F, 75M) behavior around my children (12F, 10M) and neice (11F)","How should address this with my parents?

My grandmother passed away last October at age 98. She lived a long and fruitful life, huge family, traveled the world, was widowed just a few years ago. Absolutely nothing tragic about her passing.

My mother has a strained relationship with many of her siblings, and in these final years they have all had many squabbles over my grandmother's care and estate planning. Some of them have not been on speaking terms for years as a result. Shortly after my grandmother passed, all of the siblings got together to finalize the arrangements; according to my mother it did not go well.

Initially my mother told me that it was completely up to me if I came to the funeral as she was feeling quite negative about how everything was being planned. It's a 5 hour drive from where I live and in the middle of nowhere, but I said that I certainly planned on attending, my grandmother was big part of my childhood and I wanted to be there. My mother said that was nice, but I definitely didn't need to bring my family all that way (I have 2 young kids).

We spoke a few days later, and she truly wanted me there for support despite initially saying she didn’t care.  I reinforced that I definitely planned on coming, and would likely bring my family with, even though it would be a little logistically challenging since it's such a long drive and in the middle of nowhere. She said that either way is perfectly fine with her.

A few days passed and we spoke again.  I confirmed that my family was definitely coming, and I would let her know what the logistics were. My mother offered up that staying at her place  for the night. I said I'd consider it, though her house kind of out of the way for us and would add driving time.

My wife and I explored options and landed on a BnB in a town halfway between our house and the site of the funeral. Logistically it made the most sense since my kids has stuff planned on both the Friday before and Sunday after the funeral...and the drives each way would be quite long otherwise. So I texted my mom and told her what our plan was and that we would see her at the visitation, stay for the funeral and any luncheon type stuff afterwards, and spend some time with my parents after everything is over before heading back to the BnB.

I got a call from my father a few minutes later, irate that we were ""changing our plans"" and not staying with them. I respectfully pushed back and said that I had never agreed to staying with them, and that the fact that I'm bringing my whole family there should be enough especially considering my kids barely knew my grandmother and this wasn't something they really wanted to do. Later I got more texts from my mother, telling me that I was being very hurtful.

We went to the funeral, and we were one of the few families who showed up from far away with our entire family in tow. My parents, especially my dad, were extremely icy to me and my wife. I did everything in my power to be warm, empathetic, present. We brought flowers and planted a tree in my grandmother's honor.

After the funeral, there were several weeks of radio silence with my parents until they called me a few weeks before Christmas. It was a challenging conversation, but I felt like we landed on something we could both be OK with...they recognized that I am going to always prioritize my own family first and that sometimes results in not doing everything they want. I recognized that they were hurting. A few things they said annoyed me, but I got past it. I agreed to have my family come down and spend a few nights with them between Christmas and New Years so we could celebrate the holidays together, and my niece (let's call her Hope) was also going to arrive a couple days before we do and spend the whole week with my parents.

The handful of days we spent there were fine. They were perhaps a bit distant, but overall pleasant and they enjoyed spending time with our kids. We all exchanged gifts, had meals, played games, etc. All hugs and pleasantries as we hit the road to head back home a few days later.

On our way home, my daughter said ""**Hope told me that before we showed up, your parents said they will never forgive you for not coming to their house after great-grandma's funeral.** I had to explain to her all the reasons we made the choice that we did."" This struck me as so unacceptable for so many reasons:

A. On what planet is what I did an unforgivable offense?

B. Why are they saying this shit to my 11 year old neice?

C. How can they say this just before spending a few fairly pleasant days with us?

To add an important bit of context as well, this past Summer we spent a 1 week vacation with my parents to celebrate their anniversary...my niece was there for that as well and she shared a bedroom with my parents. On that trip, Hope told my daughter ""Grandma thinks your mom is controlling"". So they were talking shit about my wife to/around my neice then as well. When we found out about this we were annoyed but decided not to approach it.

I'm struggling to figure out how to address this with my parents in a way that isn't going to just torpedo everything. Knowing my parents, they will deny ever saying anything. I also don't want to throw my neice under the bus. My parents notoriously are bad at conflict resolution and often take things extremely personally and play the victim. If I come at them at all directly or confrontational about this, they will get extremely defensive.

TL:DNR - My parents talk shit about my family to my niece, and I'm struggling to find the best way to address this with them.

In this situation, would you suggest I approach this directly with my parents? Any tips on approaches? Am I off base here?",229,0.94,229,0,245.0,16.0,84,1736950853.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i1yepo/i_44m_am_struggling_to_appropriately_deal_with_my/,False,True
1jwoeyz,relationships,I’m afraid my husband is an alcoholic,"My (40f) husband (45m) and I have been married almost 20 years but my husband's drinking habits have been an issue the last 5 years. It used to be that he would drink if we went out to dinner, during holidays, or social events. He didn't really drink at home. His drinking picked up at home during the Covid shutdown. It's not that he's a mean or violent drunk, he's just annoying. I feel like I can't connect with him when he's drinking, we can't have a conversation, and he's pretty much into his phone the remainder of that night.Aside from that, I know that drinking isn't good for him, especially how often he drinks.

I only drink during social events or holidays. It's just never been something l've been into or have done regularly. I've tried talking to him about his drinking multiple, multiple times and he gets defensive and says it's because I don't drink. 

A few years ago, he promised to keep it to a 12 pack a week. At some point that got bumped up to a 15 pack a week. We go out to eat 1-2 times per week and he will have 2-3 beers at dinner each time. So he consumes at minimum 15 beers a week, but if you include his beers when we go out, it can be between 17-21. He consumes his beers over a 3 day period which includes his weekend. 

I've been suspicious a few times that he was buying more than a 15 pack at the store every week and hiding it i me. I asked him yesterday how much he bought and he told me a 15 pack.

Tonight, I counted that he had 15 beers in the fridge, but there were 5 cans in the trash. I asked him again how much did he buy, and he confessed that he bought two 12 packs. I told him again, that he has a drinking problem, and he, again, told me it's because I don't drink.

TLDR: my husband drinks 15-18 beers every week over a 3 day period. I’ve asked him to cut back and be becomes defensive. 

What should I do if he doesn’t want to change? I have a hard time trusting anything he will say at this point. ",226,0.93,226,0,244.0,18.0,95,1744373798.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jwoeyz/im_afraid_my_husband_is_an_alcoholic/,False,True
1hdh0as,relationships,Wife spent 1800 on a weight loss course,"My wife (39F) came to tell me (38M) today that she is spending 300 per month for the next 6 months on some weight loss coaching. 

I was initially stunned at the amount, but went along with it. We have also spoken once since, but I still don't feel reassured.

She has done similar courses in the past, but never followed then for more than a few months. Later we spoke in more detail, and she thinks that by spending so much, she'll follow through this time as it will hold her accountable. 

The course consists of catch up via WhatsApp 3 times per week and daily meal check-in. 

While we can technically afford it, it's not a small amount of money for us and we have a number of savings goals that we committed to together. I'm just so concerned about a number of things:

1. It feels like a con. 
2. It seems to provide very little, compared to the cost. 
3. That she won't follow through and it will be a total waste. 
4. That I'll end up resenting her spending so much without feeling like it was a team decision (we'd never usually spend so much without discussing it) 

Looking for advice in how I can raise it again without sounding controlling, as my instinct is a straight up 'Hell No' due to my concerns above. 

Or preferably help to convince her that she's perfect just as she is. Would mainstream counselling be better, instead of some weight loss rip-off

1o9yyfy,relationships,BF unsure about marriage because he resents me for secretly acting in my best interest.,"Throwaway account since my partner is on reddit.

First time posting here so bear with me. Its a loooong read but Idk I feel like its all important. TL;DR at the bottom.

I (30F) have been together with my partner (30M) for 2,5 years currently, lived together for the past 2 years. 

For some context; we are both high earners (him more than me), living in scandinavia. We own a flat centrally together and both work from home. No kids or pets. We are both avid hobbyists; music, dancing, gaming, restaurants, friends etc etc.

Recently my friend (30F) brought up the topic of marriage with her partner (30M), and after snooping around I found out her partner is planning on proposing in a couple weeks, even though they have ""only"" been together for 2 years. Im super happy for her and I think they will be an absolute great match! However, when she asked me about my relationship with my partner, I was caught off guard and simply stated that we are in it for the long haul and I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else. 

Following this, I decided to discuss the topic with my partner a month ago, just to see where we stood on this together. I mentioned that I would also love to get married at some point. I thought that we were on the same page on this, but it turned into a huge discussion where he basically confessed that he isnt sure if he sees us going long term, atleast not the marriage part, but he still loves me and wants to be with me. He listed some aspects of our relationship that he wants to work on and that we have to get couples counseling for him to feel comfortable enough to get married. 

Mainly he explained that he feels very negatively affected by my mood swings, even though they arent aimed at him. Eg. if im upset with work/my hobbies/my struggles with acne etc he feels bad and starts spiralling mentally himself. And he isnt sure how to deal with this. He mentioned that there has been alot of ups and downs for the past year; stress from moving apartment, being upset over my 3month long Bronchitis, tearing a hip muscle and not being able to do my main hobby of dancing. He also wanted more solitude at home, to not be disturbed when working/gaming, so he felt that he had time to recharge socially. 

I can understand all of these concerns and I think its valid to work on them, but I was honestly shocked because I felt like these were quite minor inconveniences. Nothing large enough to warrant not getting married? And is it wrong for me to be scared/sad/angry  over health issues and leaning on my partner? Or being snappy if you are in a bad mood? I never yell. I tend to get more quiet and broody when Im upset. 

For the past month I tried really actively to address my actions and behaviours. I would hide my negative emotions and try to be extra happy around him. Before asking or discussing anything with him I would say ""Hey, are you busy right now? I have a question to raise, but its okay I can talk to you later if you want to"". I would make sure not to disturb him during his weekly sunday game sessions. I also had a big deadline come up for work, so I communicated clearly that I am going to be very busy and try not to be moody about it (but obv it might leak out here and there). 

Yesterday he asked me to pick between two different couple therapists and we ended up discussing the topic further. Suddenly, he was complaining that I dont do the small stuff for him. That I dont offer snack plates when he is gaming or show affection in small ways. That I am slow to respond to his texts etc. I told him that I was trying to give him space, not disturb him but Im feeling like he wants paradoxical things from me. I have a hard time knowing when he wants me to be affectionate, and when he wants me to be alone because he never communicates anything. Im just supposed to read his mind. Apparently he and his gamer BFF make it work flawlessly so I should too (???). 

Then he basically told me that he resents that he does a bunch of things for me to make me happy, even though he didnt want to do them. His example was when we were travelling to Japan last year and I got FOMO from dancing, so he agreed to book a practice room and we trained a bit.

I was completely taken aback. He is angry with me because I wanted to do something a year ago and instead of simply saying that he doesnt want to do it (like an adult) he plays along but then resents me for it secretly??? And then he sits there playing the perfect partner, saying that everything he does is to make me happy. I told him in a angry but calm voice that he needs to learn to fucking communicate his wants and needs, not act in my best interest and then secretly hold it against me. I told him that I want a partner that wants to marry me, not pretend to do shit for my benefit and then hold me accountable for something I have no idea about.

He apologised for that and said that this is all part of why he wants us to go to therapy together, so he/we can learn to communicate better and avoid creating this resentment. To avoid going through our shitty childhoods.

I have agreed to try couples therapy but I have to admit it felt like he forced my hand a bit. And now im afraid of resenting him for this whole shit. The cherry ontop is that he is planning to get me a ring for my birthday next week even though I have never asked for a ring or for jewellery. I feel like its some kind of twisted joke/consolidation price; ""Im not gonna marry you but here is random ring for your birthday"". 

I love him with all my heart and I honestly cant imagine spending my life without him, even if he acts stupid sometime. He is very kind and attentive and hasnt got a bad bone in his body. But I also am not sure what to think of all of this? I feel like he is looking for some fairytale relationship, where noone is ever sad or has bad days. Is it a bad sign to go to couples therapy after only 2,5 years? IF he ever proposes to me, will I be able to be happy then, or will I remember this charade and be angry? 

TL;DR
BF of 2.5 years says he’s unsure about marriage and wants therapy first. I tried changing to meet his needs, but now he says I’m too distant. He resents things he agreed to do and is getting me a random ring. I love him but feel confused and hurt.

1iodemg,relationships,"I (27F) and my boyfriend (28M, Luke) have been together for two years, and he wants us to move in together at his place, but for me, that’s impossible. What can I do?","I (27F) and my boyfriend (28M, Luke) have been together for two years, and he wants us to move in together at his place, but for me, that’s impossible. English is not my first language, so sorry for any mistakes.

He lives in a rented one-bedroom apartment in the city, while I live on the outskirts in a safe neighborhood. The house I live in is a two-story house split in half with my best friend (26F, Kay) and her daughter (4F, Bee). We each have separate entrances, and the only thing we share is the yard, but on the ground floor, there is an interior door that connects both sides, which is always unlocked.

Luke hates that Bee comes into my part of the house regularly for any reason and that Kay leaves Bee with me when she has to go out for appointments, shopping, etc. (She always checks with me first to make sure I’m available). I don’t mind this at all—I love Bee, and I enjoy spending time with her. For context, both Kay and I work from home, and Bee goes to daycare in the mornings.

Luke hasn’t liked Bee ever since one morning when she came into the kitchen while we were having breakfast and ate the pancakes I had made for him. He got really mad and started yelling at her, saying that those were his and that she had no right to be in my part of the house. I stepped in and kicked him out because I don’t tolerate anyone talking to Bee like that. He left and ignored me for two days, and when we finally talked, he said I couldn’t prioritize Kay and Bee forever and that Bee should stay on her side of the house. I got mad and told him that he was the adult in the situation and that if he had just waited five more minutes, I would have made him new pancakes. The argument dragged on until he finally apologized to me, Bee, and Kay (even though he was clearly forced to).

Now, to the present. Luke asked me if I wanted to move in with him because his lease is up in two months. I agreed since our relationship has been good overall, but I assumed he meant moving in with me since I don’t pay rent here, and we have more space. That’s when another fight started—he said he would only move in if I locked the interior door from my side and distanced myself from Kay and Bee, which I refuse to do. He left a few hours ago, angry, and now I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR My boyfriend wants me to move in with him bur in a rental because he hates my bestie's child .

EDIT:
I didn’t expect so many responses in such a short time. Here are the answers to some of the questions I’ve seen. Thank you!

I got back together with him because our relationship has had more good days than bad.

It’s not that easy to find someone who accepts this living situation.

We didn’t have this issue in the first year—it only started in the past year.

I’m not going to move out of this house just because he wants me to, because I can’t distance myself from Kay and Bee.

When we’ve had parties in our yard, he’s never had any issues with Bee, Kay, or other friends and kids—these problems only come up when we’re alone.

Regarding the financial aspect, I don’t think he’s using me because his salary is only slightly lower than mine.

Aside from the pancake incident and a few other arguments about Kay and Bee, our relationship has been really good overall.

Bee can’t reach the upstairs area where the bedrooms are—I have a childproof gate that opens at 1.5 meters, so she’s not tall enough to unlock it.

Whenever the door between our homes is opened, both Kay and I get an alert on our phones. (We installed this after I spent hours looking for Bee in the wrong part of the house.)

Luke knew about my living situation before we even went on our first date. (We talked for a month before meeting because he was away for work in another city.) and he was ok with that.He knew that i don't want to leave this house for anything in the world.

Unfortunately, I can't have children. I was in a car accident seven years ago and had to be sterilized to survive. So you can understand why I consider Bee to be my child.

Luke has an 8-year-old niece and a 10-year-old nephew with whom he gets along perfectly.

Luke doesn't want to have children, although he said he had nothing against other kids when I told him about Bee.

The house is in both of our names. Kay used part of Bee's father's life insurance (he died before Bee was born). And I have received various work bonuses that I saved up, as well as a bank loan that I’m still paying.

I hope it's more clear now.",225,0.84,225,0,278.0,53.0,58,1739429971.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iodemg/i_27f_and_my_boyfriend_28m_luke_have_been/,False,True

I applied to the radiology nurse line, and when looking up the points it takes to get in for that specific course, I’m just a few above ”average” (Swedish system).

Anyways, my bf told me he was talking with a coworker about it and how it can be difficult to get accepted when he(my bf) said “She’s not exactly a super-genius” referring to me maybe getting in even though I’m not “super smart” I guess. I don’t even remember everything he said, that just stuck with me and I got sad. His coworker even came to my defense. I didn’t tell him it hurt me and we soon hung up bc his coworkers were going somewhere else.

Another incident about 1 or 2 weeks ago, was when him, me and my mother went shopping for flowers, when I spotted a flower species called Narcissus. I then told him that Narcissus from the Greek myth got turned into a flower and that might’ve been where it got its name. He said he didn’t believe me, so I googled it and it was accurate. I showed him and he responded by saying that he was surprised that I knew that. He then said “you’re so smart” but in a “cute” voice, like how you might talk to a dog.

I’ve always been insecure about my intelligence, and I know that obviously I’m not the smartest person. I’m terrible at math, and I have a horrible memory. Hell, even I think I’m stupid - but I didn’t expect him to think that. I even cried to him a few months ago about how I feel like I’m stupid and that I’m insecure about my intelligence. He comforted me and reassured me, but after he called me tonight I cried again bc I felt so dumb.

But I fear that it might be true. I’ve never really had good grades, mostly average, or even below that with only a few A’s in subjects like English. The one thing I’m even good at is drawing. When I was in school, I was also horribly depressed. All throughout middle school and high school I was suicidal, and I barley studied for anything and yet I managed to pass - but it all came crashing down when I was in my final year of high school and covid hit. Everyone was assigned to do the classes digitally, but I failed spectacularly. I was depressed, I started self-harming, the workload became too much and I wasn’t motivated at all.

So I ended up only having to do a few obligatory classes by re-taking the last year of high school, and then taking the other classes required for my “high school exam” in an adult school when I turned 20. That’s how I met my bf. One of the classes were math and honestly, I might’ve not even passed if it weren’t for my bf helping me study.

I just feel so stupid. I know that I have to apply myself more to studying, and honestly now that I’m barely even depressed anymore I feel excited for the first time about university. I’ve sworn to myself that if I get in I won’t fail and that I’ll try hard. But with my bf seeming to think I’m stupid, it just makes me feel like maybe nothing has changed after all and I might fail again. Maybe he’s right, I mean I have just been a stay-at-home girlfriend since we moved into our apartment. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, I handle that stuff for us. I’m also really into pink, Sanrio and girly fashion. I really like shopping and other girly things, like hair and nails, but that just makes me feel all the more stupid.

Meanwhile, my mom(52) just got moved up a position at her job. She used to be a biomedical analyst, moved to IT, but is now traveling to different countries where she is getting trained to teach about her area of expertise.
I compare myself to her, thinking how could someone as dumb as me come from someone as smart as her? I feel like she must be so disappointed in me.

When I was a kid, I unfortunately used to be one of those “not like other girls” who hated pink, dresses and anything remotely girly. I was this way because of the environment around me, on the internet and in my home. My father would make jokes looking down on femininity, and in an attempt to gain his approval I started hating everything feminine. I was taught that being a girl meant that you were weak and stupid, and if you liked pink or makeup that meant you were even more dumb. 

This unfortunately stuck with me for a long time, and I even cut my hair short and wore only baggy clothing. Only in recent years have I been able to express myself how I’ve always wanted. I now love anything feminine, but I can’t shake this insecurity I have that I’m stupid. And when my bf insinuates things like that, it just hurts so deeply. But I don’t know if I’m overreacting.

What should I do? I feel like I should talk to him, but I’m horrible at communicating and I don’t know what to say. How do I approach him about this?

TL;DR: Bf said something that I felt insinuated he thinks I’m stupid. I got hurt and I cried.

1jxsv54,relationships,I think my (26M) girlfriend (25F) is just close minded. How do I deal with my girlfriend’s refusal to even listen?,"Context: girlfriend of 2 years

Since I saw a similar post here on Reddit recently I remembered this incident again:

A couple months ago I was looking through old photo albums together with my girlfriend and we came across a photograph where you could see my mother sitting around in underwear and bra at home.

Where I'm from (Southern Europe) summers get pretty hot and most people don't have AC in their home. So lots of people just lounge around in just their underwear at home when it's 1000 degrees hot.

My girlfriends response was ""aww you poor thing, that must've been really traumatizing for you to grow up like this"". I initially chalked this up due to her coming from a different country and told her ""no, not really, a lot of people here do that in the privacy of their own homes""

But she insisted ""sorry, no, it's just weird"" and I told her ""it's not weird unless you make it weird. People go to saunas too and there's nothing wrong with it.""

I mean, I could understand if someone was in disbelief at first. But what left a bad taste in my mouth was that instead of listening and trying to understand, my words were immediately met with judgement and prejudice.

So I tried talking it through with her and said something along the lines of ""yeah, but why would it be intrinsically weird or wrong when It depends on what culture you were raised it. Finns go sauna all the time and nobody there thinks it's weird, but someone raised in Afghanistan would feel a different way about it"".

And instead of responding to the argument, she just got annoyed and replied ""no, sorry, it's weird and it's not right. I'm dying on that hill"". This went on for another 20 minutes before I gave up.

It's not even that I'm suuuper passionate about defending my right to wear underwear in my home, we have AC anyways. But what ticked me off was how unwilling she was to even entertain a different perspective or have a thought experiment.

Honestly, I don't know what to think. This has left a bad taste in my mouth and I can't just forget it. And what's worse, I'm not even sure whether I can even talk to her about it. I'm afraid she might just go ""but it is weird though, case closed. Why are you trying so hard to win that argument?""

I don't know what to make of this. How do I deal with my girlfriend’s refusal to even listen?

**Tl;dr:** I tried talking about cultural differences with my girlfriend, but instead of listening or responding to my arguments, she just got annoyed and met my points with prejudice",225,0.9,225,0,253.0,28.0,54,1744496088.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jxsv54/i_think_my_26m_girlfriend_25f_is_just_close/,False,True
1k8w4bv,relationships,"I (27M) feel like I’m no longer deeply in love with my girlfriend (27F) after 3 years together, but I can’t tell if I’m making a mistake by ending it","My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. We live together, share a dog, and day-to-day life is comfortable. We rarely argue, and we get along well—low friction, similar humor, supportive families. I used to feel really in love with her, but over the last year or so, that feeling has faded.

Lately, I feel more like we’re roommates than romantic partners. I’ve started avoiding physical intimacy and feel less sexually attracted to her. I work from home and find myself using work to create space. When we’re together, it feels more like I’m coasting through comfort than building something exciting or deep.

She’s a kind and sweet person, but I’ve realized we don’t share the same level of drive, curiosity, or ambition. I tend to be more forward-thinking—always working toward something—and I wish I had a partner who matched that energy. She’s content with what she has, and while that’s not wrong, it makes me feel like I’m dragging things forward on my own. Even small things, like planning weekends or life decisions, feel like they’re on me.

She’s made some efforts to talk through it and asks how she can improve, but I don’t know what to tell her. It’s not a “fix this one thing” situation. She’s also mentioned wanting kids suddenly after saying for years she didn’t—and I don’t know if I trust that change. I worry I’d be the one leading all the serious parenting decisions too.

Part of me keeps holding on because it’s familiar, and I care about her. I remember back when we started dating I thought “no matter what I need to remember this is way better than the dates Ive been going on”. But I also think about being free, and the possibility of a deeper connection elsewhere. I feel burnt out. I’ve considered asking for a break just to gain clarity. She’s said she’d need space if we ever broke up, and would want the dog. I know it would devastate her, and I hate the idea of hurting someone who’s done nothing “wrong.”

Am I being selfish for wanting more when I already have a kind, comfortable relationship—or is it fair to end things if I no longer feel truly connected, even if there’s no major conflict?

TLDR: Been with my girlfriend 3 years, living together with a dog. Things are comfortable but I don’t feel deeply in love anymore. I feel like I’m driving everything forward while she passively follows. I’m debating whether it’s selfish to leave a good, stable relationship because I want a deeper connection, or if that’s fair.",220,0.86,220,0,263.0,43.0,123,1745729837.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1k8w4bv/i_27m_feel_like_im_no_longer_deeply_in_love_with/,False,True
1oj3scc,relationships,How can I help my husband understand that appreciation in marriage should go both ways?,"I (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for 10 years and married for 1. Lately, we’ve been arguing about household responsibilities — but for me, it’s less about chores and more about feeling appreciated.

He often tells me that I should be grateful he helps around the house because he’s the “breadwinner.” I do appreciate everything he does, but I also work full time — 10 to 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, as a pet groomer. I handle most of the cooking, cleaning, dishes, and general organizing at home. He handles laundry more often, manages the yard and finances, and does most of the grocery shopping.

The grocery part has mostly fallen to him because we’ve been sharing one car. We moved from Philadelphia about two years ago, and until recently, I didn’t have my driver’s license (I used to be really anxious about driving). I finally got my license last week and am now looking for my own car, which will let me help more with errands and take some things off his plate.

Still, when I try to explain that while I’m thankful for what he does, I also deserve gratitude for working and keeping up with the home, it turns into an argument. He takes it as me being ungrateful or trying to “one-up” him, which isn’t what I mean at all. I just want mutual appreciation — not a scoreboard.

How can I bring this up in a way that helps him see that appreciation should go both ways, without it turning into another fight?

TL;DR:
29F married to 29M for 1 year (together 10). My husband says I should be grateful that he helps around the house since he’s the main earner, but I also work full time and handle most housework. I just want him to understand that gratitude should go both ways — how can I communicate that without starting another argument?

1n7bvqj,relationships,My (F27) bf (M31) and I had our first fight and I was shocked at his nastiness. Am I an idiot if I give him a second chance?,"I (F27) have been with my bf (M31) for a year and he is my best friend. We click perfectly together and I think he is the loveliest cheeriest sweetest man. Being in his company is so easy. 

In the year we have been together, I have worked weekends, so he would often go out with his friends to bars etc till the early hours on Saturday nights. I quit my weekend job a couple of months ago, but he kept up his nights out and never invited me out. He had never introduced me to any of his friends. I told him nicely about my concerns and without hesitation he invited me out with him and his pals that weekend (last weekend). 

Long story short, I had a great night till one of his closest friends told me my bf hadn’t told him my name till days ago. This relit my concern he was making a point of keeping me away from his friends for some reason. This was not said in a joking fashion. I told my bf we had to discuss this in the morning when we were sober to avoid a wild public fight infront of his friends. He took immense offence, not at his friend for saying it, but at me for being concerned it may be true. I did not instantly believe his friend, but considering a few days before I told him I was concerned I’d never met any of his friends, what his friend said would suggest he had indeed been keeping me at arms length. And what reason would his friend have to lie? But also, why kind of friend would drop his pal in it with his girlfriend? It doesn’t really make any sense. Surely he should be able to understand why hearing this would at the very least concern me? My bf took this VERY badly and said we had to discuss it right now. I begged him not to, but he ignored me, so I resorted to getting him outside the bar and down the street a little to escape his friends view.

He started shouting at me very loudly for everyone around to hear (stood in the middle of the busy pub/bar strip) at 1am on a Saturday night. He kept shouting that what was said was all a joke, and then that he usually refers to me by my hometown instead of my real name so he’s probably just forgotten it over time. He kept shouting at me saying how I should trust him. He kept shouting at me to ‘shut up!’ all the while I was crying begging him to calm down and talk in the morning. He walked away, threw the umbrella off the ground and yelled back ‘How are you getting home?!’ He has his own house in that city, where I was stay over, I still live with my parents. I had to call my mum, waking her up to come the 50 minute drive to come and get me. She was very mad with his behaviour. She dropped me at his house so I could grab my stuff, he was very mad I called my mum because he wanted to play on my vulnerability and make me hop in another taxi and follow him home. He then kept erratically switching between ‘I’m sorry I love you’ to ‘get the f out my house!’ He also tried to say I didn’t try to hide from his friends I was annoyed, therefore it was me that caused a scene. This is not true, it was my priority to keep it totally under wraps. 

It annoyed me that he accused me of this, and I learned that night from another of his friends that the bar we were in has a camera in it that records the whole place for a Tik Tok live. After some research I found out you can download an app to watch back old lives. I did this, and there is zero sign of me even looking remotely sad. I was still linking arms, rubbing his back, all in an attempt to keep things calm and private. What’s interesting tho, I watched another live from three Saturdays ago, a night when he went out with his pals and left me at his and did not invite me to join despite asking me to drop him off and pick him up. All his friends are in a corner of the bar and there are two girls on the dance floor dancing. My bf walks up to them and they briefly talk to eachother, it’s obvious they don’t know eachother. He puts his arm around one and then the girl asks her friend to take a picture of them. The girls then end the interaction but he clearly sort of lingers there and continues dancing. It really looks like he wants further interaction. Again his friends are all of in a corner together. He sort of just keeps dancing at them, and they really apprear to have zero interest. He then decides to interject again and put his arm around the other girl, and then another picture is taken. This is the last interaction they have, but my bf continues to hover there for a while, until he seems to give up and go back to his friends. Am I crazy, or is this flirty? 
I asked him what would be appropriate physical contact with another woman on a night out if the guy was in a relationship. He seemed confused at the question for maybe 3 seconds and then it was like a switch flicked and he casually said ‘….errrm I dunno, putting and arm around one for a picture?…’ He knew EXACTLY what I was referring to because he knows there’s a live stream there. He realised he kinda put his foot it and was like ‘yeh but did I know them?’ And I said it was obvious he did not, and he said no more about it, because he full well knows he doesn’t know them, he just wanted to see if he could make me believe he did. I even told him to bring them up on fb and I’d be able to say if it was them or not. He did not volunteer to do this, because he defo didn’t know themselves  I told him about how is it totally unnecessary to have any physical contact on a night out with a girl when you are in a committed relationship. He totally agree with me and said it will never happen again.

Am I overreacting at the interaction with the two girls? All I could see was my bf trying to flirt with other girls and it hurt. But could it be harmless? Are some guys just really flirty but 100% faithful? Is that even possible? 

I’m left in a bit of torment because i know there’s is zero excuse for the way he shouted at me in the street, left me in a city at night alone, and then told me to get the f out of his house. That was AWFUL, and although i can tell my sister and mum think I should leave him, in a whole year he’s never said an unkind word to me. I find it hard to dump him for good when maybe it was too much drink? Or he wasn’t himself… I don’t know that I’d be able to leave him and settle knowing I am doing the right thing. 

Also, I don’t want to spy on the livestream from now on and forever more. Plus he knows that bar has a livestream, if he keeps himself in check there, he might not elsewhere.

I’m tempted to give him a second chance, and I know that if he does anything like this again, I’ll leave him and I’ll be able to relax and know that I’ve dodged a bullet.

He’s saying all the right things now. He says he’s sorry, he’ll never do it again. He’s volunteering to meet my parents and give them an apology. His other group of friends are trying to organise a meal soon and he has asked me to join them. 

I’m so confused because nothing in this situation is crystal clear? Has he been keeping me from his friends? Has he managed to make himself seem like an angel for a year, for just one night to show he can be very aggressive and nasty? Has he deliberately kept me quiet with his friends or is it true that they don’t talk about gfs very often because most of them are single? If he got a better reception from those girls and they showed interest, how far would he have let it go?

I’d love to hear people’s thoughts.♥️

1mglf1k,relationships,i think my husband lost his mind while deployed,"this is a complicated situation to explain so i apologize if everything seems all over the place. i’m doing this on mobile and my brain is fried right now.

TL;DR - my husband is trying to make everything about him while my daughter is in the hospital. 

okay to start this off my husband (29m) and i (23f) have been together for 3 years. we have an almost 2f together and i have 8f from a previous relationship that he’s adopted.

my husband, we’ll call him steve, deployed recently and got home earlier this week. during this deployment i was constantly accused of cheating, lying, etc. he was on edge with me the entire time. he constantly thought i was going to leave him, that i didn’t want him anymore, that i didn’t need him, etc.

my oldest daughter, we’ll call emily, is medically complex. she’s hospitalized roughly once or twice a month and spends most of her time in the local children’s hospital. i’ve never left her while she’s hospitalized.

she was hospitalized twice while he was gone. three times if you count the current hospitalization that started a few days before he got home. the first time she was hospitalized, he was constantly on me about everything. if i so much as fell asleep before he got off or without telling him, he was upset with me the next day. if i had to get off the phone because the doctors came in, or to tend to my girls, he’d make remarks about how i never call him back or don’t need him anymore. (he was deployed within the states by the way.. not anywhere overseas, dangerous, or where phone calls were scarce.)

i had both kids up here with me and things were constant. trying to make sure emily was okay, prep for surgeries or procedures, calm her down after someone messed with her, etc. then feeding the baby, making sure she got to play, nap on time, etc.

my day was already so full. it’s just hard to sit on the phone 24/7. he didn’t seem to understand that.

i’ve never cheated on him and we’ve never broken up. so i don’t know where these insecurities are coming from. but the need for CONSTANT reassurance was mentally exhausting. he admitted to doubting me, which hurt. he has my location and i never left the hospital with the kids here. when we were home i went to walmart once.

now that you’re kind of up to speed, he got home earlier this week and came to the hospital to see us. the insecurities didn’t stop, if anything they were amplified. he was a constant stressor here.

he was frustrated he couldn’t sleep, he was mad that i wasn’t showing him affection the way he felt i should, he got mad at emily for crying and fussing constantly. he’s never stayed up here for longer than an hour with me and emily because the hospital is overstimulating.

it was a constant “you aren’t being lovey to me.” “you don’t seem like you missed me.” “i guess you don’t love me anymore.”

he played it off as a joke when i got mad.. he told me i was being too serious and he doesn’t know why im being so snappy.

emily had a major surgery on friday. while she was in surgery all he could talk about was going to get something to eat and it really bothered me. then came the first major fight since he’s been home..

he had been home a few times during this and never switched cars.. he was in his 2 door car and couldn’t put the baby’s car seat in there. i was mad. if he didn’t come back in time to get the baby i wouldn’t be able to go down to the picu to be with emily when she woke up. he decided THAT was the perfect moment to drive 30 minutes to the house and get a different car. he wasn’t back by the time i had to rush down to talk to the surgeon about emily’s condition after surgery.

i told him i didn’t understand why it had to be right then. why couldn’t he have waited til she was done? or gotten food before the surgery? there’s a cafeteria here at the hospital, why did he feel above eating there? i told him had something happened to emily and he wasn’t here, id of never forgiven him.

surgery went okay, she had a lot of problems with her oxygen after though and had to remain sedated for awhile and receive treatments and suction through her breathing tube. during all of this i told him i felt it was best he took the baby home. he was stressing me out being here and honestly, the baby wouldn’t have been able to go to the picu if we had to be moved back anyways.

when emily stabilized fully i asked if he’d bring me a few things to keep busy while we waited over the weekend for the DME to get to the hospital to figure out home supplies and care.

here comes the weaponized incompetence. i told him i need the beads in the bag and i needed him to pick up beading needles. (i do beaded embroidery) he’s seen the beads a million times, i sent him pictures of what i needed from the store as well. he proceeds to send me pictures of pony beads we have for bracelets.. i told him “no the ones in the bag..” again. he facetimes me and shows me the pony beads again. keep in mind, the bag of beads is RIGHT NEXT to the pony beads.

he finally gets the beads and keeps talking over me while i try to explain what i need. i was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he forgot what beads. i don’t know. so i was explaining. he wouldn’t listen. kept trying to finish my sentences and talk over me. i asked him what size beads i had so i could send him the exact needles i needed to save myself the 20 minutes phone call we’d have while he was in the store. he said “small.” and it set me off. i was done. he knows there’s sizes on the beads. it felt on purpose at this point.

i told him i needed to go, to not worry about the beads. he started getting loud with me and asking me why i needed to leave all of a sudden. i told him i was frustrated and didn’t want to fight so i needed to get off the phone.

he tells me he didn’t do anything wrong that the “small” comment was a joke. he told me that ive been mean to him the whole time and he knows im mad at him.

i haven’t been mean to him. i actually very calmly explained to him that i know things should be about him right now. i told him i wish he could’ve had his “coming home” moment and that it’s unfair to him. but that right now it’s about emily. that conversation was right after the car incident during surgery.

i am mad at him, but i didn’t want to fight with him while my kid is in the hospital. so i’ve been walking on eggshells and letting everything slide. i just can’t take it anymore. i don’t understand this.

my world is falling apart. he can’t handle being up here for an hour without yelling at emily about being loud, or getting visibly frustrated because he’s overstimulated. but god forbid i show a singular ounce of frustration after being up here for weeks taking care of both of my kids and babying my husband.

the beads weren’t that big of a deal, it’s just the straw that broke the camels back. i’m just tired. i’m tired, i’m frustrated, i’m hurt. it hurts that my husband so whole heartedly believes i would do something to him while he’s gone. that i’d leave my kids at the hospital to run off on him. it hurts that he doubts me so much after years of reassuring him and doing everything i can to help his trust issues.

it hurts that he’d choose to do it when i’m already in the most stressful situation you could put a mom in.

what do i do? i’m currently sitting up here with emily, she’s playing with a pop it and watching cars for the 10th time today. i have to act like i’m not hurt and that nothings wrong. me and steve aren’t speaking right now either. i told him i can’t handle him right now, that id update him on emily but that he’s too much for me to deal with on top of everything else. she didn’t even fully stabilize until last night.

i just need help. i need support. i need my husband to just stop trying to make every single thing about him..",216,0.89,216,0,246.0,30.0,103,1754233246.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mglf1k/i_think_my_husband_lost_his_mind_while_deployed/,False,True
1i6etl2,relationships,My husband has been (at least) emotionally cheating on me. ,"Apologies for any disjointedness, I’m still in shock. 

My (30f) husband (30m) have I have been together for over 8 years. We have a life, a home and dogs. We were planning kids. I thought we were happy. 

A couple of weeks ago we had a conversation where I told him I was uncomfortable with the way he spoke about one particular colleague and how much time they seemingly spent 1:1 together. He had mentioned that he found her attractive but assured me that it was just normal workplace banter and that they were just good friends. I trusted him and let it go. 

Fast forward to the Friday just gone and he shuts down. Tells me he isn’t sure he loves me, if he ever wanted to get married or if he was just pressured into it by family. If he only got with me because I was “broken” and he wanted to be the one to fix me. How we have nothing in common (this is bullshit we have very similar tastes in most things).  He tells me he doesn’t know who he is and he needs time to figure it out. He thinks the last 8 years might have been a lie and that he might love his colleague. 

Cue an awful weekend of me giving him space within our home to try and respect his needs, while also reminding him of all the best parts of our life and relationship. How we were genuinely happy to my knowledge and how I wanted to support him with whatever sadness or pain he was having. I couldn’t eat or sleep.

He went to work as usual on Monday and I made sure to be out when he returned in the evening to see if coming home to an empty house would matter to him. It did and he said he realised how much he cared for me and wanted to work on it. 

We had a long conversation and ended up having makeup sex, cuddling and working on a jigsaw the rest of the evening. 

When we went to bed the conversation looped back around somewhat and I mentioned that now I knew the worst we could try to move forward, that honesty was important to me. He implied that it was worse than I thought so I asked to see the messages for full disclosure. He refused and so I instantly knew there was more to this. 

Eventually I see the messages and it is far worse than he let on. They had been texting each other how much they wanted to fuck and going so far as to make plans for where this was going to happen. They had been doing this after I told him I was uncomfortable those weeks ago and while he and I were physically intimate and at home together. While we watched films and cuddled together. While we were in the pharmacy queue waiting to get a plan B pill. You get the idea. 

I have a meltdown and tell him he has betrayed me and broken my heart. I try and find somewhere else to stay for the night but my friends are all asleep by this point and I can’t bare telling family. I also can’t afford a hotel. I end up going back to see him and tell him that I’m fed up of trusting him to do the right thing and that I would like to send her a message from his phone. I do that. All things considered it was civil but honest. No reply as yet. 

We then speak for hours about what has happened, how it had come to this point. How he could think we could make up and put his hands on me without telling me the full extent what I was actually supposed to be forgiving him for. 

He implies it is my fault for not being intimate enough with him and making him feel special. I tell him that he never communicated this to me, that we could have made an effort if it was making him that unhappy. Even though we have had far from a stale bedroom, especially lately.  

He agrees to see a couples therapist and we both decide to try and get some sleep (going on nearly 4 days of shit sleep at this point). 

It’s now Tuesday morning and he’s gone to work. I’m at home, emotionally numb and have no idea what to do next. I’ve found somewhere to stay tonight but… what do I do? How should I feel?

TL;DR, My husband has been (at least) emotionally cheating on me with a colleague and making plans for more. I don’t know how to proceed and I don’t know if I can ever trust him again.

1mdfmhi,relationships,Me (41F) and my husband (42M) have stubbornly different opinions of date night and family activities lately. So does the whimsical die and sourness invade in every relationship after 10 years and kiddos?,"Husband and I have been together since 2012 and married since 2017. We have three kiddos – 7, 4, and 2. We’ve been through lots of ups and downs but try to talk it out and move forward. We have mutual interests (e.g., skiing/snowboarding) but also enjoy other activities at differing degrees.

Me (41F): Prefers physical experiences and activities – travel, hiking/backpacking, museums, any activity but like variety. Sitting at a restaurant is very low on my list.

Him (42M): Prefers comedy shows and movies, eating out, lake activities, and being with his family.

We used to do all kinds of things together - concerts, restaurants, ice cream shops, museums, gallery openings, walking the dogs, meeting up with friends, etc. - and some stuff he coordinated and some stuff I coordinated. Now everything feels like a struggle with him unless it's something he absolutely loves (e.g., paddle boarding or a comedy show). And we've started doing stuff separately.

For context, we rarely go on date night (maybe 3 per year) and had a recent interaction and conversation that concerned me, and I don’t know how to navigate it.

Last weekend, I set up a date night for us to go to an outdoor concert at a big park near our home. Concerned that the concert may not be his type of music, I suggested instead that we do a casual 9-holes or less followed by some drinks. He said that if he played golf, then we would have to play the 9-holes which takes 3 hours. I didn’t understand why we had to play all 9-holes but he pushed on it. I was disappointed, said no thank you, and asked him to come up with a different option for the night. Needless to say, we ended up not going on a date night and instead I took my youngest to the concert for 45 minutes.

So then, I proposed a hypothetical date night idea of going to an MLB game.  In our town, you can get cheap tickets ($20) and lots to do at the ballpark – watch the game, grab food, hit the stadium rooftop bars, etc. In this scenario, he said he would have to stay all 9 innings. In my version, I said we’d stay until the 7^(th) inning stretch and then go down the street to a hip bar for cocktails.

Apparently there is no compromise between us, and it makes me not want to spend time with him. Concerned we are drifting apart, losing our relationship, and losing ourselves in the process.  I don’t know how to navigate this and am open to suggestions.  

Also, I’ve suggested he choose one date night and then I choose the next date night. That doesn’t seem to work because either he never plans anything or I plan something that he doesn’t like.  

TL;DR – Husband and I have differing opinions when planning date night and family activities and tension arises quickly. Seems to be no compromise and concerned we are losing our partnership and ourselves after 10+ years and starting our family. Is this common? Can we get out of this?  How can I be amenable to his preferences but also stay firm on some things that make me happy?

1lp0ig3,relationships,"When he's unemployed and depressed, I need to show him support, but when I am, I need to ""do more""","I [27F] was unexpectedly let go from my job a week ago, a dream career path of mine, so I've been feeling pretty depressed about it. I immediately started applying to similar fields, but nobody in that type of work is hiring currently. I ended up applying to jobs i don't really WANT but I know I NEED for income. I've also been trying to push myself to go out and do some app food delivery as well to make a couple bucks to help have SOME type of income. Already in the process with unemployment (but thats gonna take forever). I got myself signed up for a free class that would help me expand my employment radius, and I have been working on completeting a medical examination that was set up already prior to me being terminated but because of insurance messing up, it keeps getting delayed. I've been feeling.... rough to say the least. My fiance [29M] hasn't really been helping me with it either. [Together 8 years]

About a month and a half ago he decided to quit his job without having anything lined up. He was very depressed at that point and said it was work that was causing it and putting a strain on our relationship. So he quit. Because I was still working, I was doing the math and reassuring him that we don't really need to panic money wise for a little, so it wasn't really the biggest deal. For a solid week he was couch bound, I would come home and ask him what he's done, he would say ""I watched a show/movie"", and that would be the consistant answer for days. I suggested he works for a food delivery service in the meantime, he said he would sign up. A week goes by, he still doesn't, why? He's depressed. More days pass with him doing nothing. At this point im still trying to show him support, not push him into finding a job, trying to have fun with him to keep his mind in a positive light. 2 weeks (on week 3 now) later he finally scores a job. Seems like a great place too. Training doesnt start for another 2 weeks. Okay, at least something is secured. At this point money is starting to get a little tight, but still no panic because im still employed at this point. The Thursday before his jobs starts, I'm let go. So technically (other than my last paycheck), no income coming in. I immediately start job hunting, doing food delivery, getting onto unemployment, signing up for that class I said earlier, but the fact of getting terminated has been hanging over me. Im still processing it, and as of today its been a little over a week. His job did start, he's beginning week 2 now of training which is awesome. We don't know when his first paycheck will come in yet.

I've been having moments of imobilization, not constantly, but its been happening. I've been glued to the couch for a few hours, but I'll snap myself out of it and take care of some chores, apply to more jobs, do follow ups, etc. After the tasks are done, my brain goes imobile again. Ill try and do food delivery, make $30 here, $50 there, its inconsistent and ive definitely skipped a day or two. I think in total I've made about $250 in a week and a half of food delivery. I know it could be more though. 

My fiance keeps telling me any free time i have, i need to be out trying to make money. Telling me i need to get off the couch and DO something that'll support us. Where's my support? Why is it when the role is reversed, I don't need to have the same support I showed him when he was unemployed? I celebrated his little wins with him on the days where he was most imobile. I never pushed him towards applying for jobs. I never yelled at him to do MORE. 

His argument is he was COMPLETELY depressed, where as I still have the motivation to get up and do things. I get up and do things to help motivate myself. I don't want to be a vegetable, I don't want to be completely depressed, keeping myself occupied helps me mentally, even watching a show instead of doom scrolling helps me. He says I should talk to my doctor about the depression, he's right there but idk I got FIRED, of course im going to have some type of natural depression about it. It's an upsetting thing! ""Well i spoke to my doctor about mine, and i don't even have health insurance, you do!"", okay, I just need to get a secured job again and I think I'll be back to normal, thats just my thought. ""Why are you comparing the two?"" Because I feel its valid to do so.

Am I crazy!?!?! Im sorry im not spending every breath trying to get money, but im doing a hell of a lot more than what you did when you were off for a MONTH. Where's my hug? My support? My kind encouragement? My celebrated wins for putting my best foot forward? ""We went to the carnival because you wanted to, thats me supporting you"", well yes, but thats it? Thats all my support?

TL;DR: Fiance says i need to do more during my period of unemployment even though I've been doing more than what he did when he was unemployed.

1o2drxz,relationships,"My (26F) mom (53F) suffered brain damage after surgery. My dad (51M) came to help, but he’s becoming more of a burden than support. I don’t know how to handle him.","TLDR: My (26F) mom (53F) suffered brain damage after surgery. My dad (51M) came to help, but he’s becoming more of a burden than support. I don’t know how to handle him.

My mom went in for what was supposed to be a minor surgery, but she suffered a series of complications and ended up with brain damage. She was in a coma for a month, and it was the most terrifying experience of my life. She’s now out of the ICU, in rehab, and slowly improving, thank god.

I normally live in another country but flew back immediately. My dad, who is my mom’s ex-husband, came from another city to help. Despite their divorce, my family has always been close. Both my parents are kind, open-minded, loving people. But my dad is… complicated. He’s emotionally deep and affectionate but very irresponsible and unreliable. He’s a great friend but not a dependable parent.

He relocated his job to stay and help long-term, saying he doesn’t want to leave me alone and wants to take care of my mom so I can eventually go back to my life. But in reality, I do everything. I go to the hospital daily, cook for my mom, handle her neuro-stimulation, buy and research tools and supplements, organize photos and playlists to help her memory, you name it. It’s exhausting, and I’m proud of what I manage, but I’m one person.

My dad, on the other hand, drifts. One day he takes five hours to make a simple soup. Another day he decides my mom can just eat hospital food (which is awful—I’ve tried it myself). When I ask him to cook, he argues that he “deserves free time.” Today, for example, he did absolutely nothing while I handled everything.

I’m at my limit. I’m angry and tense whenever he’s around. I feel like I’m managing two dependents, my mom and my dad. He keeps saying things will be fine, but he never follows through. It’s messing with me emotionally, because I do love him, and he quit his life to be here but I can’t rely on him.

Has anyone been in a similar situation: caring for a parent while dealing with a difficult family member who means well but makes things harder?

1jbp6lj,relationships,Should I (28F) let my husband (31M) attend his sister’s (29F) wedding?,"
My husband (31M) and myself (28F) are expecting our first child this May, 2025. We found out very early in September, 2024. We did not keep this a secret from anyone and in fact, shared the news in person with his family and my family on the day we found out. During this period, his sister (29F) was getting to know someone and getting engaged in October 2024. It’s sort of an arranged marriage as she was set up and decided to get engaged only after 3 months of speaking to the guy. Her parents (my in-laws) were happy that she liked him and wanted to quickly move forward. She’s been wanting to get married for the past 5 years. 

After the engagement party in October, there was a brief discussion of when the wedding would be. His sister had mentioned that she wanted to be married by no later than April 2025. After our initial OB visit in September, my husband had mentioned to his parents that I would not be able to travel after 34 weeks as per the doctor. His mother decided to ignore this information and not address it. His sister and mother decided to plan on having the wedding in April 2025 even though they had not booked anything. His sister’s fiancé lives in Texas, a 3.5 hrs flight away. I briefly mentioned that I would not be able to attend in April as it would be too close to my due date but wished them all the best in their planning. 

February 2025 rolls around and they decided to have the wedding this upcoming April 19th of 2025 in Texas. I tell my husband that because I will be 37 weeks pregnant, that we would definitely not be able to go. A month prior, during a huge fight we had, his mom had told him it’s okay if I don’t go but that he would have to attend. At the time, I was not opposed to it, as I thought it would be fine.

Two weeks ago, we met with my OB, and I decide to ask her for advice while he was also in the room. I ask her for confirmation that it’s not a problem if he were to travel during my 37th week. She looks at both of us and says “Absolutely not” we both stare at her shocked and she continues and says “this would be like rolling a dice, I would not recommend it. If something were to happen, I would not be able to slow anything down.” He unenthusiastically agrees and says it’s messed up that they picked a date knowing we most likely would not be able to attend. 

It’s now almost April, and he just told his mother that we will both for sure not be able to attend. My husband and in-laws have a huge fight and he explains the situation so his dad threatens that he wouldn’t attend either if he’s not at the wedding. I don’t budge after he tells me this and calmly state that he simply cannot attend two weeks before my due date as we’re both having this baby together. 

TL;DR, I am conflicted if I should let me husband attend his sister’s wedding in a different state while I’m 37 weeks pregnant ",212,0.84,212,0,262.0,50.0,46,1742020896.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jbp6lj/should_i_28f_let_my_husband_31m_attend_his/,False,True
1hso0wr,relationships,My [31m] mother-in-law wants a weekly dinner during the weekdays but it messes with my schedules and preferences.,"I married my wife \[30f\] 3 months ago and my mother-in-law wants us to join the tradition of having dinner with her once a week on Wednesdays, as her older daughter and her husband have done for the 7 years they've been married.

I... don't know if that's what I want. My wife is perfectly fine with that but I don't think I'm going to be in the mood for that every Wednesday, forever. I often study in the evening and go to the gym, and some days I just want to chill with my wife.

Usually I go to the gym Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, but if I miss Monday or Tuesday, I'll go on Wednesday.

Also I have a quite limited battery for social interactions. I'm not sure that I'll look forward to this dinner every single week. Additionally, my wife visits her parents often so there'll be weeks when we have dinner on Wednesdays and some other lunch or dinner in the weekend, followed by dinner again the next Wednesday.

I feel a bit socially overwhelmed just thinking about it.

That's not to say that I dislike my mother, sister, or brother-in-law, it just means that some days I want my wife to be the only human being I interact with after coming back home.

I can see that my wife is looking forward to this so I would like to flip a switch in my head to be totally OK with this but I'm not, at least not right now.

How do I manage this? How do I psych myself into giving this an honest shot?

1obsrui,relationship_advice,UPDATE: My (27F) boyfriend (29M) of 7 years cheated on me. I'm going to disappear from his life. Is there anything I'm missing?,"This is an update to this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ob55ol/my_27f_boyfriend_29m_of_7_years_cheated_on_me_im/

Thank you everyone for all the solid advice. I'm compiling everything I did in this first section so if others need a way to cut contact with a person, they can reference this. As mentioned in the comments:

* I logged myself out of our apple TV and xbox
* I cancelled the wifi that I paid for and returned the modem to the carrier. 
* I took my payment information for utilities off our account. 
* I packed up all my sauces, spices, and cooking oils, and took note to only leave dried rosemary behind (he hates that shit).  
* I printed out and framed the screenshot of his tinder profile and left it on the kitchen table. I closed a piece of dog poop into the frame as well. I'll keep the photo albums. He can have this. 
* I took a video of the entire apartment after packing up all my things. I left my keys in the mailbox to the leasing office and emailed the leasing office of my departure with the videos of what the apartment looked like prior to locking up. 
* I updated my address for the USPS, vet, hospital, school, work, and my dog's chip. 
* I talked to HR and am in the process of getting him off of my health insurance, changing the benefactor of my life insurance to my parents (if only I could name my dog), and emergency contact. 
* I'm going to the bank to take myself off the joint bank account. Fortunately, I'm not worried about my credit as all of our finances have stayed separate, but I'm grateful to those who told me to freeze my credit.
* I logged out of all devices for all streaming services, social media, and my work, personal, and school email. 
* I blocked him on all social media, chatrooms, and his phone number. 
* I made a doctor's appointment to get STD tested.
* I'm on my way to an appointment with the county office to terminate our domestic partnership.

It's been an incredibly busy 18 hours but I've had a lot of help from my friends. I haven't been able to sleep either. As far as what happened since he arrived, here's what's up: 

I already blocked him before he landed. I received many texts and calls from his parents and sister that I did not see. Then, when I noticed his sister calling, I picked up. At first, the call was hostile. She accused me of being some crazy ex girlfriend that couldn't let her brother go. Funny, since I just packed up and left. She brought up that it had been ""4 months"" and that I needed to move on. I told her that the ex never approached me about breaking up and that 1 month ago, we celebrated our 7th anniversary and started to plan our wedding. I had no indication he even wanted to break up. 

We reset a bit and she allowed me to tell her my side of the story. I told her he was somewhat distant this year, but he had blamed it on their grandparents being old and wanting to spend more time with them before they die. Turns out, their grandparents have been dead for 2 years. I never met them because my ex claimed they were super racist since the grandpa was a Vietnam war vet (I'm SE asian). Turns out, you can't be racist when you're dead! 

We ended the call on a positive note, with his sister saying that it was a lot to take in. She said she felt bad as the girl he was cheating on me with was one of her friends. She had introduced them to each other sometime last year when my ex was apparently unhappy with our relationship. They hit it off and he was supposed to break it off with me. I guess he never had the balls to do so. She was also confused as to why he was on tinder as he was in a relationship with her friend. I sent her all the tinder receipts after hanging up. 

Later in the night, I received an email from the ex. To sum it up: yes, he asked me to come to the apartment to talk it out. No, he did not apologize for anything. He ended the email with ""I love you"". As far as I know, he doesn't know where I am. I also don't believe he knows where my friend lives as she just moved and he hasn't been here yet. He also doesn't seem like that type of person, but I guess I didn't really know him after all. We'll keep locks ready and bats near the door. 

It's been so helpful just writing out everything that's happened so far, but all of your advice, support, and guidance in this situation has made me feel empowered me to leave. At times, I just wanted to stop packing and hope that when he came home, everything would go back to normal and the text would just be a distant memory. Your words of encouragement have really helped me follow through and leave. Nothing good would have come from staying. Thank you all again. 

EDIT: just added a link in the beginning to the original post 

EDIT 2: Sorry, I was unclear about the timeline. The parents and sister called me about 2 hours after he landed. I assume it was because he got home realized the person paying half his rent will no longer be doing so and reached out to his family. The dog poop may have contributed to the heightened emotions.

1hbrhz2,relationship_advice,"The guy (22M) that I (21F) am dating is learning ASL for my brother, but my friends think it's creepy. How do I proceed with this?","Throwaway because my regular account has some personal info. Also, fake names are used.

I (21F) met Jon (22M) in a college class last semester. He's an overall great guy, and he's very respectful and kind. He also has a great sense of humor, and we have lots of similar interests. We've been friends since then, and we've started dating this July. He's the first person I've ever dated in my life.

Last September, he met my family when I visited home for my brother's birthday. My brother (Trev, 19M) has been deaf since birth, so my whole family communicates with him either through sign language, Trev's lip reading (but we still just sign as reflex), or through text.

During our small celebration at home, it was clear that my parents liked Jon. He was very charming, funny, and respectful. He even tried to connect with Trev by typing some of his jokes for Trev to read (although my brother could lip read as well). Whenever Jon would tell a story, either I or my parents would sign for Trev.

My parents said that they're happy that I found a sweet and caring guy in Jon. Of course, I'm glad to hear this.

Before we went back, Jon and Trev had a quick Call of Duty gaming session. For someone with Trev's condition, he is a really ""talkative"" guy lol he's very expressive and likes to communicate a lot, especially when gaming. Of course, he couldn't outright trashtalk, but he does the closest thing with his hands. So, there we were at Trev's room, with Jon and Trev playing while I was translating for them. I was laughing way too hard because Trev was trying his best to trashtalk Jon like saying he's weak and trying to say all these expletives but I'm trying my best to tone it down for Jon. Meanwhile, I'm also translating Jon's instructions and strategies for Trev. Also, because this was the first time Jon met my family, he was saying all these praises to Trev like good job or we can do it better next time, although I know that deep inside, he also wants to trashtalk my brother.

The two of them got along pretty well, and they've been having some online gaming sessions since then.

Two weeks ago, Jon visited home along with me again for my mom's birthday. There, he surprised everyone (including me) by communicating with Trev through ASL. Jon was still at the alphabets, some basic words, and some rehearsed phrases, but we were all delighted that he even made the effort. Trev's face lit up and I've never seen him happier having a new long-term friend with low communication barriers. Apparently, Jon had been watching some Youtube tutorials and got a free subscription to Skillshare to learn ASL.

The two of them had a gaming session again, and this time, Jon and Trev could communicate more directly. Of course, it was still kinda slow and I still had to do some translating (imagine trying to baby talk to a grown man or talking to a caveman with choppy sentences lol), but I could tell Trev was having a great time. They also got more comfortable with each other with more explicit trashtalking, which I didn't tone down this time.

Jon had been religiously learning ASL since then, and he's making a lot of progress.

I was so happy with this, so I told my close friend group from high school. However, most of my friends, especially my closest guy friend, told me that what Jon was doing was a red flag because it could be a form of obsession and emotional manipulation. He also said it was creepy because Jon's becoming too attached to my family when we've only been dating about 5 months. He also said that Jon might only be doing it so he could get laid or something.

I know there's some validity to what my friends said, but I'm not really convinced. Jon has been a wonderful and sincere guy the entire time, and I know it's naive to say this because he's my first ever relationship, but I can see this becoming long-term. Yes, we haven't hooked up yet because I told him I wasn't ready yet, and he never pressured me to do it.

However, is his behavior something I should really be concerned about? Again, I don't have any experience with dating and relationships, so I don't know if this is something that's truly concerning. My friends are pushing for me to break up with Jon, but I'm not sure. How do I proceed with this?

TLDR: I've been dating a guy for 5 months. He met my family 2 months ago and had befriended my brother, who is deaf. The two of them have been gaming with each other ever since. The guy I've been dating has apparently been learning ASL to communicate with my brother better. However, my friends said that his behavior could be seen as obsessive, emotionally manipulative, and downright creepy. How do I proceed with this?

EDIT:

Wait woah I took a break to work on a paper and there are now almost 1k comments. I'll try to process everything, but thank you for your kind words, Reddit! Yes, Jon is a wonderful guy and has so far given me no reasons to doubt his sincerity. It's only my friends who planted the seeds in my mind since they've all had experiences with dating and relationships, so the pressure kinda got to me. Thank you for all your insights!

EDIT2:

I went to class and did a lot of schoolwork. Came back to this post with over 4k comments. I didn't expect this! I'll make sure to read and process everything, but so far, I'd like to thank everyone who weighed in on this. A lot of your insights have been truly eye-opening, and it really looks like I've got a lot of reflection to do with my relationships and connections.

1ku42hv,relationship_advice,[UPDATE] My boyfriend (31M) is going away for all of Memorial Day weekend to spend time with his friend (31F) in a cabin alone.,"Original Post TLDR:

My boyfriend (31M) is spending Memorial Day weekend alone in a cabin with a friend (31F), which is triggering for me due to past experiences with inappropriate boundaries in my last relationship. He says he doesn’t want to go and suspects she may have romantic feelings, but he’s still going out of guilt and some vague obligation to her. I (29F) feel excluded, disrespected, and confused. I want to support him, but also need to feel prioritized and emotionally safe. How can I express this without being controlling?

UPDATE:

I offered potential solutions, I offered compromises. I was clear with what exactly was bothering me and that I would never put him in this position. I told him he would be so incredibly hurt, and rightfully so, if I did this to him. 

I told him he could decide for himself what he wants to do, and I told him what I wouldn’t be tolerating from a partner. He acknowledged and agreed that everything I was saying was true.

Then he went. Because “he wants to get out of the habit of being so flakey” and “made a commitment so he has to go”.

I texted him that I’ll always love him (now only) as a friend, like I told him from the very beginning.

Now I’m not even sure I can, or want to. Love is a choice. The opposite of love is indifference, and he’s all but told me he’s indifferent to me both as a partner and as a friend.

Thanks for the tough love, Reddit. I’d rather be angry - at him, at myself for not seeing this coming - than be sad while he feels absolutely nothing.

Edit to add:

Yes, I ended it. I can’t even think about him or the situation without being angry. I look forward to when the anger turns to indifference.",10178,0.99,10178,0,10282.0,104.0,582,1748064179.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ku42hv/update_my_boyfriend_31m_is_going_away_for_all_of/,False,True
1ob55ol,relationship_advice,My (27F) boyfriend (29M) of 7 years cheated on me. I'm going to disappear from his life. Is there anything I'm missing?,"I (27F) just found out my boyfriend (29M) of 7 years cheated on me. My boyfriend went to his our home state to see his family for the weekend. He's been going quite often this year, about once a month, saying it is because his grandparents are old and miss him. I thought nothing of it until this morning. I got a screenshot from a mutual friend of ours of my boyfriend's location on snapchat. 

He was at his parents house but a girl's bitmoji was there as well. It wasn't his sister or mom and his parents (who weirdly also have snapchat) weren't home either. He didn't tell me he was going to be with anyone one else today. I tried to call him but he did not pick up. I looked on snapchat and his location was turned off. 

The mutual friend says my boyfriend has told everyone at home we had broken up 4 months ago. He said my boyfriend was making him stay quiet about it because he was trying to find the right time to tell me. As far as his parents know, he's moving home once our lease is up. The reason our mutual friend told me was because he walked in on my boyfriend and the girl hooking up with each other this morning. 

I texted an old friend who lives in my hometown, and she immediately asked why my boyfriend was on tinder. We caught up and she sent me proof his photos on tinder and his bio. It hurt to see that photos I took of him were used. He had even covered my face in a photo we took together and said ""this could be you"". 

I had no idea his family thought we were broken up and that he was looking for other people to date. We even went to Italy a month ago celebrating our 7 year anniversary! I'm so confused and I don't know what to do. I look around and everything in our apartment seems like a lie.

The soon to be ex texted me just now and he is on his flight back. He'll be back in about 5 hours. Obviously, he can find his own way to the apartment from the airport. 

I'm shocked and numb, but my best friend is with me helping me pack up all my clothes. I'm leaving and I'm not leaving a trace of myself behind. Our dog is coming with me, and I'll be staying at my best friend's place for now. 

My soon to be ex and I already have separate bank accounts, and our joint bank account does not have much in it right now. I make more than he does so he can keep it. I can't go to the leasing office because it's closed on Sundays, but I sent an email asking for early termination on the lease. We're registered as domestic partners, so I've completed the termination form and will drive it up to the LA county office tomorrow. He is on my health insurance, and I've sent the email to HR to kick him off ASAP. 

We have several large photo albums together, and I'm not sure what to do with those.  Keeping them would be too difficult but I don't want him to have the satisfaction of having our photos. It's clear he uses our memories in a horrible way. 

Is there anything I'm missing? I can't seem to think of anything and all my thoughts seem so jumbled. Nothing makes sense, but I know I can't stay. Any help to ghost a person this close to my heart would be appreciated.

1hzfl61,relationship_advice,"My (26f) bf (30m) got me Pokémon for Christmas and I can’t let it go, do I call it quits or work it out?","For context, my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Since I’ve known him he has always loved Pokémon. Personally, I have no interest but as his partner I encourage his hobbies and support him. This past Christmas we had a few brief conversations about Christmas budgets and have mentioned to each other things we have been wanting. I knew Pokémon packs were on the top of HIS list so I made sure to get him some. I mentioned wanting a few beauty products and a specific hoodie. Well Christmas comes around and to my surprise I open my gifts, the first one was a pack of Pokémon cards, okay whatever, the next one was a booster box of Pokémon cards. I stop and ask him if he’s joking, because this must be a joke right? Welp he smirks and tells me to keep going, I open my next gift, it was ANOTHER booster box of Pokemon cards. He was full of excitement while I open “my” gifts. That’s it those were my three gifts. I AM NOT AND NEVER HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN POKÉMON. After this I told him I needed a moment to myself. I went to our bedroom and took a moment to gather my thoughts and lower my temper. When I came back to the living room there he was on the floor, both booster packs and the pack of cards he got “me” were opened and sprawled across the floor. I was in shock, not only did he get me gifts that I didn’t want, but he actually got them for himself and tried to play it off. I have been trying to move past this as I did not want to seem ungrateful but I just can’t believe he would do something like this. Every time I have tried to bring it up, he has told me how expensive those booster boxes were and how I made him feel bad for not appreciating my gifts.

1iyzkpv,relationship_advice,UPDATE My(28M) husband(27M) just came out as straight.,"Thank you to everyone who gave me genuine advice on my last post. I’ll quickly answer some common questions; No, he does not have a family history of bipolar disorder or any other mental health disorder that would cause sharp changes. No, he isn’t cheating on me with one of his church friends, but I will get more into this later. No, he isn’t bi. I’m bi, and we’ve had conversations and he said he experimented in highschool but it wasn’t for him. 

I talked to his family and our friends about the whole thing. I explained we were separating because of his new found faith and how he’s acting. I told them about the shit he said and they’re all worried for me. I don’t think that I’m in any sorr of danger, honestly. I did talk to my church about this, and they told me that the church he’s attending is notorious for this sort of thing. One of them will show up after a service and wait outside, and if someone is walking out alone they’ll come up to them and start chatting. They’ll pretend they go here until they’ve talked to the person enough times to invite them to their church. Apparently he was attending my church even on days where I wasn’t, so he was alone a lot. It’s really fuckinf predatory and it lowkey pisses me off that he was enjoying my church and it lead to him being taken away from me. 

I’ve had limited contact with him in the past few days. He came over last night, saying he needed to talk to me. He didn’t appreciate me contacting his parents, and assured me that he is fine mentally. I wanted to start asking all the questions I’ve come up with since he left, but I didn’t want to overwhelm him. I know he didnt cheat on me because that was the first question I asked. More so, “Are you leaving me because there’s somebody else?”. His response was that he didn’t want to leave me, but living in sin wasn’t what he wanted anymore. How did he figure this out you ask? After grilling him for an explanation, he finally admitted that he tried to cheat. The guy who kept coming to my church and basically recruited him was apparently sooo attractive that he would listen to anything he said. So he tried to cheat, failed, and went the full 180 and has decided being gay is the ultimate sin. Not the fact that he tried to have an affair. This is actually going to drive me crazy.

Finding out he wanted to cheat but didn’t is almost worse, because it’s like seriously? You tried and got rejected?? That’s embarrassing as shit for you, and doubly embarrassing for me. I asked him if they knew he was married to a man, and he simply told them I was his gay roommate who turned him, and now that he’s “straight again” I’ve gone off the deep end. He’s an actual fucking liar. 

He showed me some bible verses, ones that were just blatantly different from the ones in mine, and kept trying to convince me that I need to change too. He said that he still cares about me, and wants to be friends. I asked him what about our actual friends, and he said they’re too far gone. He just kept talking and I was done with it. He isn’t the man I fell in love with and it pisses me off. He wasn’t even dressing the same anymore. Fucking white dress shirt and slacks and the most boring hairstyle ever. He didn’t look like my Anthony. 

The more he talked at me, the more it was clear I didn't want to be with the man he is now. He left, and for the second time in our life, he walked out that door without saying I love you, and I was fine with that. 

This morning I talked with my lawyer and I am going through with a divorce. After I was done, I stopped by where he was staying and knocked on the door, half wanting whoever owned the place to be there when I gave him the papers, half because I didn’t want him coming to my home anymore. When the man opened the door I realized this is who he was talking about, and it took a bit to keep my anger in. I asked for my husband, and when he saw me, the look in his eyes made it clear that he wasn’t expecting this out of me. I made it clear to the other guy that I was handing my husband, gay husband, divorce papers, to end our marriage, the gay one between two men. Us, we’re those two men. Because I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if you wake up next to a man for 3 years out of your life, chances are you are a homosexual. So sorry to break it to you. 

I won’t be able to go into details of the proceedings themselves, but I’m going to completely distance myself from him as best I can. His actions have been horrible on my health, and his family and friends can handle him better than I can. I’m going to miss the man he used to be, but I have my people surrounding me. I’m going to be okay. I hope for his sake he’ll snap out of this one day, because the self hatred isn’t healthy, but when he does I won’t fucking be there.

1hqeyfv,relationship_advice,I 26 M lost the trust of my fiance 25 F after she confessed something really shocking to me in bed. How do I move forward from this? ,"So, it's the morning hours where I'm from, woke up to some quality time(sex)with my fiance before we start our day. After everything we had come to an end we laid down cuddling and one thing lead to another and was telling me something along the lines of if I ever left her she would make sure the other woman had to work really hard to keep me (something along the lines of breaking my manhood) which was unusual and funny but I guess when the sex is that you tend to get a little crazy, so I don't know how the conversation came up but she then said i have a confession to make and I'm just like OKAY while I held a smile on my face, that's when she said and I quote we had a fight(non physical) it was to the point that I was so frustrated that when I when to make you dinner I snuck something into your tea that makes you sleep and I was watching you fight that sleep, your eyes were so red and when you did actually went to sleep I sat down and watch you as I contemplate what to do about us and so many thoughts were going my mind while I watch you slept for like a few hours and I eventually got tired and just went to bed. End quote. The fear in my eyes were real as I just listen to my fiance admitted to being a fking Psychopath and to drugging me while she contemplated on a way forward.
I know for a fact I don't trust this woman anymore and now I'm even more scared to sleep with her  or to eat from her all because we had an argument over her not doing what's right. We haven't spoken for the entire day after that confession even after she's made several attempts to talk. I'm afraid to even go to my friends knowing they'll just laugh and say it's probably nothing bro and tell me to relax.

1kpi7oc,relationship_advice,My (29F) husband (34M) is in the hospital after a suicide attempt. I see him tomorrow and I don’t know what to say.,"We’ve been together for almost five years. We live together. We’ve talked about having kids, getting another dog, picking names. Life felt normal. He seemed fine. I didn’t notice anything no red flags, no weird changes. Nothing.
A few days ago, I finished work early. Two meetings got canceled last minute, and I thought I’d surprise him.
The house was quiet. I figured he was napping or something. Then I noticed the bedroom door slightly open, and I found him unconscious. There were pill bottles and an open bottle of vodka.
I completely panicked. I don’t remember the 911 call. I just remember kneeling next to him, crying and yelling his name, trying to get him to wake up. The EMTs said it was close. He was unconscious for about a day and a half.
He’s physically stable now. But he’s not talking. He’s in the hospital for psychiatric evaluation, and when I called today, they told me he’s really quiet. barely saying anything. They said I can visit him tomorrow.
I’m scared. I don’t know what to say to him. 
Do I acknowledge what happened? 
Do I pretend everything’s fine and talk about the dog or something light? 
Do I sit in silence and just let him know I’m there? I want to scream and cry and ask him why, but I also don’t want to make it worse. I don’t want to push him.
I keep thinking how did I miss this? We live together. We sleep next to each other every night. We talked, laughed, watched dumb YouTube videos. He was texting friends, playing games, making plans. There was no note, no goodbye, nothing.

EDIT: A lot of people brought up debt/cheating. I checked our bank accounts, his phone, laptop. I found nothing 

EDIT; He didn’t say much. I got him a few things. Snacks, soda, comfy clothes. I told him I love him, I gave him a big hug. We didn’t really talk he just apologised to me. I told him we will talk once he’s ready. He’s on meds so he’s not fully aware of what’s going on. I know he’s ashamed. I brought him his toothbrush, his slippers and lotion. 
We just sat in silence. I told him I’m glad he’s alive and once he’s ready we will get him help he needs.",7284,0.99,7284,0,7358.0,74.0,545,1747569258.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kpi7oc/my_29f_husband_34m_is_in_the_hospital_after_a/,False,True
1jk407d,relationship_advice,UPDATE: My coworker (18M) put me (22F) on a “hear me out cake” and posted it online. Do I take action in some way?,"I work at a diner as a waitress with this kid, let’s call him John. John has always seemed pretty chill and busses my tables. Sometimes we chat if we are closing together, usually about school, as he started college not too long ago and I am almost graduated with my BA. Ultimately, we are friendly but not friends. 

Last week he said that he was part of a group chat with a handful of other coworkers on instagram and asked if I wanted to join. I said sure because I haven’t connected with people at the diner that well and figured it was worth a shot. We swapped instas. The group chat is very normal, friendly banter between coworkers. 

Yesterday, I see that John posted a reel of him and a couple of his buddies doing their take on a “hear me out cake”, which is usually a very lighthearted and funny way of saying you would get with what are typically fictional and mostly animated characters. The entire cake adhered to that concept, except toward the end, when MY FACE (a picture that he must have screenshotted from one of my posts), is stuck on the cake. I was the only real person on that cake, and John actually made a comment about how attractive I was and that he wished that he could “hit that”, but doubts he has a chance. 

I feel insanely grossed out and kind of violated. I want the video taken down, but am not sure if I have the right or authority to do that. I ranted about this to my sister, and she told me to just take it as a compliment and be glad that someone thinks I am pretty. It feels wrong doing that. 

Is this grounds for taking this issue to higher ups? I don’t know if I am comfortable working with him at the moment. Do I just take care of this myself and tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and I want him to take it down? It is a public video. I am just uncertain how to move forward. 

UPDATE: Hi! Idk if this is how you do an update, but this is how I am doing it. 

So, I screen recorded the video and sent it to my manager. We are on good terms and I was hoping that she would understand and we could rework the schedule so that I don’t have him bussing my tables and we won’t have to interact. She said this is very odd and may be a violation of conduct? She told me not to stress about the details and that she would take care of it. I am very grateful with how seriously she took it. She had moved me around so that I will not have to see him as much and I only have a handful of times since then. He has avoided eye contact with me entirely. 

Once my manager was aware of the video, I dmed John on insta saying:
“The video you made in which you put my face in a hear me out cake for social media is gross and unprofessional. We are coworkers. I did not greenlight being posted online and sexualized like that. I have talked with ___ (manager) about the situation and my discomfort and would like you to take the video down. You used my image without my consent.”

He responded and “apologized” saying that he and his friends were drunk and that he made that video on a whim. He told me he thought I was cool and wouldn’t have a problem with it. He said he would take it down but never once actually said sorry, just a gave those excuses. It was deleted. He has been having to take an online course about sexual harassment and workplace misconduct or something like that. Something probably meaningless but at least it is slightly a pain in the ass. 

The only thing now is that he has busboy buddies that side eye and kind of glower at me because of the action I took. On the bright side, they probably won’t fuck with me like that. 

Anyway, thanks to anyone reading. I am not sure if anyone will see this, but the comments on the last post were mostly helpful and I am grateful for the perspective that you guys provided, so thanks!",7280,0.97,7280,0,7512.0,232.0,212,1742964548.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jk407d/update_my_coworker_18m_put_me_22f_on_a_hear_me/,False,True
1oaeeio,relationship_advice,Update- My 24F husband 26M left me passed out on the floor while sick and then got mad at me the next morning. I see him different now?,"Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/7wOhrmDor2

Hi, so I'm still alive. I've had a surprising amount of people message me a week or two ago and it's very kind of you people to care.  

I'll go right into what happened. I went to the hospital that day, since a shocking percentage of people suspected he could have messed with something but no. The doctor said nothing came up. But he DID say I had high blood pressure and recommended me to a cardiologist. I still have a month left before the appointment. 

When my husband got home from work, he was acting like everything was normal. I wanted to see if he would inquire at all about my faint the night prior but nothing. So after the baby was settled for the night, I asked him why I woke up alone in his office.

He got instantly angry with me and seemed annoyed I even brought it up. He said that I was acting confusing and what was he supposed to do? I should have told him what I wanted him to do.

I told him about my visit to the hospital and he said that going to the hospital is a little much. I told him the doctor said I am showing signs of heart issues, likely caused by stress. He blew up on me, yelling that I'm causing my own early grave and that it's my fault for not taking care of myself. 

With that, he closed himself in the room... leaving me to clean up after dinner alone again. Except I decided that I wouldn't so I went on the couch and watched a movie. 

He came out, suddenly friendly and flirty?? He tried to lay with me and ask what I was doing. He kept trying to act ""cute"" and when I wasn't showing much response to it, he got angry and stormed off, locking me out of the bedroom. 

The next morning, I woke up to him slamming around the kitchen and cussing about how I couldn't even properly clean the kitchen. I just went to the bedroom and went back to sleep, if you can call it that because he kept doing things to keep me awake. He complained later that day about how he was so hungry because I didn't make him breakfast or lunch.

I gave myself a break day. I didn't work, didn't focus on the house, I was just a mom and spent time with our baby. I went to the park, to the library, to my in laws. I tried to talk to her about the heart thing, and she responded with ""poor *husband's name*, he's probably going to stress about this.""

That's when I realized I couldn't do this anymore. 

I got pizza for dinner and got home right after my husband. He was not happy and it was different this time. 

I tried to ignore his obvious tension, he cleaned the kitchen very loudly and was muttering under his breath. I washed up our daughter and put her to bed, trying not to feel anxious.

When I came out, he started talking very aggressively about how I've been letting myself get lazy and he won't take my lack of effort. A relationship is a two-way street he said. 

I started yelling back about how I cook, clean, manage his child and work at the same time so how is it that *I'm* the one that's lazy when he keeps expecting me to do more things too.

Things escalated and he started throwing dishes at me. When he ran out of things to throw, he strangled me.

Then he left the house and I called the police. My baby was woken up, the neighbors were there because they heard yelling and glass breaking. 

It was chaos. When he came back, he tried to say I did everything. Even the bruises around my neck were self-inflicted apparently. 

I'm still trying to process everything, it all happened so fast. Sometime I wonder what would have happened if I had just sucked it up and didn't 'rebel'. Would our relationship be fine? 

I have my first therapy session scheduled for next Tuesday so I guess I'll talk all about it then.

My husband is at his mom's now. I'm at my Grandmothers for now and have almost all my stuff out of our appartment. We have a temporary restraining order, official hearing is tomorrow morning.

I'm scared if I'm honest. I haven't seen him since that night. My daughter keeps asking me where dad is and I don't know what to tell her.

There's my update. I feel so numb to it all. I can probably type much more that happened but it already feels so long. Plus, I don't want to cry again.

Edit: I reread this all and I sound like a big whiny baby oh my goodness. I'm sorry, I promise I don't sound like this in person ahh

I also wanted to add a thought; I don't know if I would have called the police and all if I hadn't posted before. I honestly don't know. This is the most scariest thing he's done to me, but he's done plenty of other things before. When I originally posted, it was more of a vent post. All your caring, kind thoughts moved me. It gave me the little push I needed. I only have my little sister and my grandmother. I cant tell my grandmother any of these details because shes too frail and sensitive. My dad was an alcoholic and died while driving under the influence. My mom left us after that for a guy in Russia. I don't know how she's doing but she used to treat us very poorly so I don't really care. 

Point is, thank you all. The responses here are too kind and I don't even know what to say.",7274,0.98,7274,0,7426.0,152.0,714,1760841182.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oaeeio/update_my_24f_husband_26m_left_me_passed_out_on/,False,True
1jdyo2e,relationship_advice,I (28F) rejected my husband (33M) for the first time and his reaction grossed me out,"My husband and I are trying to spice up our sex life (I am the one actively trying to, he’s just along for the ride). We were watching a racy movie and I asked him if we can choose two toys out of our collection tonight. He gave a “do we have to?” kind of reaction and made a vibrator joke. We went to the bedroom, I pulled out the box of toys and he chose the wand, and I asked him if he can choose another, and he said no. Because it feels like pulling teeth to try to get him to be proactive in our sex life, it upset me enough that I told him I don’t want to have sex anymore. 

It’s the first time I’ve ever rejected him, whereas he probably rejects me at least several times a month. 

He demanded I come back to bed “or he was going to get really pissed.” 

I think that reaction is insane. Tried to communicate how I feel like how we go about our sex life makes me feel unsexy and undesired, he refused to communicate with me and now I’m sleeping on the couch.

We’re already going to couples counseling, what the hell am I supposed to do. 

EDIT: There was no point where I was forcing him to do something he didn’t want to do. We got the toys as part of a compromise for the lack of effort he puts into our sex life. 

For example, I have asked him to blindfold me for five years. He doesn’t say no, he says “do I have to?” I have had conversations with him about how remarks like that kill the mood. And then he tells me he wants to try more kinky stuff but when it’s actually in the moment he’ll sigh and act like it’s a chore. 

I feel like I make such a big effort and this man has not once given me a massage without me asking. And of like the 7 massages I’ve ever asked him for, not once has he been able to respond with anything but “do I have to.” 

EDIT 2: Feels crazy to have this blow up. I cried earlier today because I heard a couple friend of ours did a pottery class together. I literally haven’t asked him to do anything like that in years because the first handful of times I asked him to do an activity like that he also said things ranging from “do I have to?” to “I will never do these things with you”. I know living like this is restricting my happiness. Guess it’s time to take some steps to move on… 

EDIT 3: he went out with a friend of his and we talked when he came home. So my husband is a struggling artist and works part-time at a “regular” job. His friend is also an artist and told him that his wife pays a larger portion of their life/bills/etc, but she doesn’t mind it because she wants the father of their children to have integrity and be the guy that does the thing he sought out to do, regardless of whether or not he makes a lot of money. My husband insinuated that she’s a supportive wife and I am not. I’m so exhausted. I am also an artist (with a corporate day job and an evening corporate job, and I am a freelance artist on the side). I make about $15k a year on my art. My husband loses anywhere from $2k to $10k on his art. We have a two bedroom and one room is his dedicated studio. I do not have a home studio, I make do with our living space. I have put thousands of dollars not to mention mental and emotional energy into helping his art career. He has left me to go to social events/trips/family gatherings alone because he needs the time to do his art. And I have deluded myself into being proud of being such a chill wife, giving him the “freedom” to do whatever he wants. Everyone we know gives me props for being such a supportive wife. I can’t believe he’s comparing me to someone else’s wife and saying I’m not supportive. Truly what the fuck. Hoping for an amicable divorce but my gut tells me it’s going to be nasty. I just wanted a nice simple life with someone I love. What a bummer.

I don't even know what she qualifies as, if mistress is fitting or not. It was a drunken one-night mistake- my husband's words. They run in the same work circles and field but don't work together. My husband was dropped off at our house 2 months ago drunk off his ass after a company event. He was crying and out of it, blabbering about nonsensical things. I tried sobering him up, but his legs couldn't even support him, and I couldn't drag him to the couch, so he slept it off on the ground and the next day he confessed to everything.

He was crying and I've only seen him cry a handful of times in all our years of marriage and he said that everything was foggy, and he doesn't remember much but that he slept with her. I won't type in my reaction because I can only describe it as violent. Not physically but I unloaded on him and sobbed and screamed and then lied to our kids after it woke them up.

We tested him for drugs because what he was describing (foggy memory/didn't drink that much etc) was assault and as awful as it is, I felt a little bit of relief that it might have been and that he hadn't willingly cheated on me but there was no trace of drugs in his system.

The past 2 months have been brutal on us but we're slowly working on us in therapy. Some may call it weak that I didn't divorce him, but I just can't bring myself to do it and believe me I thought about it a lot. He hadn't had contact with her since that night up until she got his number and sent him a picture of her bloodwork a few days ago- She's pregnant and is asking him to meet up. That sent us into another spiral, but we agreed that I would meet her because there's an innocent life on the line.

I wish I can say she's awful and I hate myself for this but under different circumstances, her and I would've been good friends. She seemed ashamed and honestly looked lost. She's not that much younger than my husband and I, we're 33 and 34 and she's 28 but grew up sheltered by her religious parents, not that it's an excuse but from what she said. I asked her what she was going to do with the baby and she got quiet. I don't know what I thought she was going to say but it certainly wasn't her asking me to leave him. She said that once her bf finds out he'll leave her and her parents will cut her off for having a 'bastard' baby and that she can't do it on her own and that I'll get a nice settlement and start fresh. I laughed. God help me but I laughed harder than I thought I could while she started crying. These past 2 months have been testing my sanity, and I don't have that much left in me. Once I calmed down I told her that I will not leave him. If she wants to have the baby, we'll figure out support and custody but that was about it.

She started crying harder in the middle of the cafe but hell, we were already getting looks from my unhinged laughing and begged me to leave him. I told her I won't. My husband and I have been together since I was 14 and he was 15. We stuck together through highschool, got engaged and married throughout our BAs and Masters, have 2 beautiful kids and were trying for more and I won't throw that all away just because she spread her legs and he fucked her once. He's all I've ever known, I don't fucking remember a life without him in it. And let's say I agreed to leave him then what? He'll marry her and she'll take over my life and be in my kids lives raising them half of the time? I didn't let her get a word in and I was crying by the time I was done with my rant, and I left her there, she sobbing too.

My husband and I already talked with a lawyer for a paternity test and we're waiting on that before we do anything else. My husband sent her a text with my contact information and told her all communications are to be through me before he blocked her number. I didn't ask him to do that but he's trying. I just don't know where to go from here if it does turn out to be his.",7078,0.94,7078,0,7561.0,483.0,1540,1734957501.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hkmvtu/my_33f_husband_34fs_pregnant_mistress_28f_begged/,False,True
1iv21l7,relationship_advice,My(28M) husband(27M) just came out as straight.,"So we’ve been married for like 3 years and dated for about 2. In total, five years of a gay relationship. We’re two men, have always been two men, and I don’t think that’s going to change anytime soon. My husband and I have had a rather healthy relationship for the most part, of course we have minor arguments every now and then but what relationship is perfect? In the end we always resolved them and our affection would continue as normal. This is kind of why I’m really confused by what’s going on with us. Why now?

I’m a christian. I know a lot of people don’t like the idea of that, but gay christians do exist. My husband was agnostic– not necessarily an atheist, just wasn’t completely on board with any religion. And that’s fine, I would have supported him if he found peace in literally anything. He didn’t need to become a christian, and honestly, as selfish as this sounds, I wish he didn’t. I know this makes me sound like a terrible person, but he changed so drastically afterwards and I miss the man he used to be. 

It was a slow start, he asked me about verses from the bible, we went to church, he even fasted for lent. Christmas this year was much more than just presents, and I was happy that I had this piece of me to share with him now. I was raised religious and struggled with my identity. If it weren’t for other queer christians, I would have left christianity. I was glad that I still had these things we could bond over – but it kept ramping up. All of a sudden, he’s going to church more than I am (which is perfectly fine), is always carrying a bible with him, and will randomly cite a verse when we’re having political discussions. I’ve noticed his views have started to shift towards the right as well, and recently retweeted someone saying “your body, my choice”. You’re a twink, women's reproductive rights DON’T concern you in the slightest? It kept ramping up. He started agreeing with the whole LGB minus the T crowd, and started spewing harmful rhetoric about drag queens – as if we aren’t friends with a bunch of them. When I told him that drag queens are much less likely to harm children than some pastors, he lost his shit saying I was a “heathen” and that his friends were right. This is the part that caught my attention. What friends?

I asked him what he meant by that, and he started backtracking, saying he was tired and that we should go to bed. I was tired, and arguing didn’t seem like it’d do us any good right now, so I put a pin in it and we got ready for bed. Our room has a bathroom connected, and usually we keep the door open. He takes a shower and makes sure to lock it, which was weird but I didn’t say anything about it. If he wants to set this boundary down that’s fine, but he could at least communicate it, yk? 

The next day is a sunday, and he’s already out of bed and I’m assuming at church. I get up and got ready, but once I arrived I realized he wasn’t there. That confused me, so after the service I called him asking him where he was. He tells me he’s in church, but I told him I was here too and didn’t see him. He clarifies he means this the OTHER  (I’m not going to say the denomination because I don’t want to cause any arguments) church. This was news to me, especially because he never brought it up and still carried our bible. I told him to send me the address and I’ll pick him up so we can get brunch, but he tells me that he doesn’t want his friends seeing me. That hurt. I asked him if we could at least meet up and he said he’ll see me at home. 

After a few hours, he finally comes home. He says we need to talk, I agreed. I wanted to ask him why he didn’t want his friends seeing me, and as I open my mouth to ask the question he said “I’m straight”. I stared at him for a bit, and he continued, explaining that his church helped him realize he wasn’t going to see the kingdom of God if he continued living in sin and that he needed to leave me as soon as possible. He told them about the pastor comment I made last night, and they said that I was a devil trying to lure him away from Christ. He started repeating a lot of the same rhetoric I heard from other christians growing up, and it really upset me. He even said that I could be saved, and that I already had the traditionally masculine look, and that I just needed to steer away from homosexuality.

I feel like I’m in an alternate reality right now. I’m being told by the love of my life that I’m a devil that needs to return to Christ because I shut down his homophobic rhetoric. My gay husband is being homophobic. I’m sorry, but not once in the 5 years we’ve been together did he realize he was suddenly straight? It just doesn’t work like that. It’s not like we’re in some other universe where comphomo is a thing, right? 

I told him that he needed to leave and that we could discuss arrangements afterwards. I still want him, I love him. But I have no idea how he could look at me with a straight face and tell me all of that. He started arguing saying that he didn’t want to leave and that we could be friends, so I told him that I wouldn’t be friends with a self hating queer for the life of me. He packed a bag and left. His location shows he’s at some random house I’ve never been to, but I assume that’s one of the church goers he’s friends with. 

I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do from here. Did I seriously just lose my husband? I don’t understand how this could happen. What can I do now? I miss him already.

1og8p9d,relationship_advice,"I (28f) commented on a post of my boyfriend (29m) on a ""are we dating the same guy"" page and he found out. What are my next steps?","I (28f) recently found a post of my boyfriend (29m) on a local ""are we dating the same guy?"" page. We have been together for five years. There were several comments on there of girls stating they texted him/went out with him and I couldn't tell if this had happened recently or if it could have been from a long time ago.

So I commented on it anonymously asking if anyone has talked or hooked up with him recently and a girl responded saying she did and asked if I did as well and if I had any ""tea"" on him. I probably should have said I was his girlfriend, but I was so embarrassed I couldn't, and worried I wouldn't get any information so I just said he told me not to talk or sleep with anyone else and he wouldn't either but that we never hooked up. She responded back claiming he said the exact same thing to her. I then asked when they last hooked up and she never responded back.

My boyfriend then comes home and is furious, slamming doors, giving me dirty looks, but won't say anything to me. I know he knows I was the one who anonymously posted because I had suspicions that he had been cheating on me and have recently been asking him, and he denied doing so.

I then go back to the post and all of her responses are deleted so I know she told him, and I'm sure he told her to delete them, but he's pissed at me for it.

Anyway, what are my next steps? Do I confront him about it or just wait and see if he says anything? 

Also, we rent an apartment together and are on the same lease so that makes things even more complicated.",6762,0.96,6762,0,7056.0,294.0,721,1761443571.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1og8p9d/i_28f_commented_on_a_post_of_my_boyfriend_29m_on/,False,True
1ncsjei,relationship_advice,My (22f) birth control was tampered with by my boyfriend (22m). I'm pregnant. I don't know what to do.,"My boyfriend (22m) and I (22f) have been together for 3 years. We were high school friends, grew apart, ended up going to the same college, similar majors, reconnected, you can guess the rest. 

We've been on the rocks lately. Our lifestyles just don't align very well, and sometimes he treats me more like a mother than a partner. I am losing patience.

He is an only child, and kind of a massive momma's boy. His mom is nice enough, just very traditional. Until recently, I don't feel like I've had a reason to distrust her. He confides in her a lot about our relationship, sometimes an uncomfortable amount. For the past couple of months, I feel like she's been trying to plant seeds in my head about having kids when I'm alone with her.
Some examples:
""The joy of motherhood is like nothing else. You'll understand someday."" 

""I know it's hard right now. You know, a baby might bring you closer."" 

""My husband and I fought constantly until we finally had [bf's name]."" 

""Once you have a baby, everything else falls away. They're little miracle workers.""

""You know, fatherhood changes people. I think [bf's name] just needs to experience it."" (that last one in regards to his irresponsibility and lack of accountability for housework)

I'm on the pill. I've been trying to get on a different form of birth control that doesn't require constant effort (like an IUD, injections, arm implant) but I haven't been able to decide which one is right for me. My birth control comes in a blister pack, but I usually pop a week's worth into a pill organizer so I can just take it with my other medications. I don't bother taking the sugar pills you're supposed to take during the week of your period.

I keep the empty blister packs with the leftover sugar pills in my nightstand because I'm weird about throwing things away sometimes (""what if I need it later"" mentality I picked up from growing up in a doomsday prepping household. thanks dad). I feel incredibly stupid for that now.

A couple of weeks ago, I missed my period. Took a pregnancy test, saw the dreaded second line, and proceeded to freak out. BF was at work when I found out, so I called him immediately. I told him we needed to talk, and that it was urgent. He didn't want to come home at first since we are not in a great situation financially. I started bawling and begging, and I think he realized I was serious.

When he got home, I was sitting on the bathroom floor. I was a wreck, cried so hard I vomited. Anyways, BF gets back to our apartment, finds me on the floor, and as soon as he sees the pregnancy test, he fucking smiles. His face lit up, and I saw red. No acknowledgement of the state I was in. The first thing he said to me besides, ""what's going on??"" was, ""oh my god, baby, this is great!"" I wanted to put my head through the wall. 

I tried to explain to him through snot and tears and spit that no, this was not great, we're both full time students with jobs. I can't take time off. I have a ton of unresolved health issues. We can barely afford the roof over our heads. I hate the idea of getting an abortion. I am all for it when it's someone else, just for me, I don't know if I can bring myself to do it.

He left me to cool down in the bathroom for a while (I told him to get out) and I saw one of my fucking blister packs in the bathroom trash can. We don't use it very often, so we only empty it once in a while. I threw away the pregnancy test, it knocked aside a wad of toilet paper, and the silver foil caught my eye. I dug through the trash and I found 7 of my regular fucking birth control pills at the bottom of the trash bag. I can't believe he not only did this to me but also was so incredibly careless. It's like he barely tried to hide it. I can't tell if he wanted me to find out or if he just genuinely doesn't have anything knocking around inside his cranium besides a few rocks.

I had been wracking my brain trying to figure out how this could've happened. I am so, so diligent about taking my meds. I feel so fucking stupid. So so so stupid. The sugar pills are literally a different fucking color. I take like 7 pills in the morning and unceremoniously dump them into my mouth, I definitely didn't look closely at them. He didn't give me a reason to think I had to. He hadn't said anything about kids. I could tell he was kind of trying to be better about his responsibilities lately, I thought things were finally starting to look up when it came to the state of our relationship.

We have access to each other's phones. I think he probably checked my fitbit app to find out when I was ovulating, since I track my period there. I don't know how else he could've known. I think I remember a few times I'd unlock my phone and find the app open, but I thought nothing of it. 

I confided in a few close friends about all of this. Told them everything. What he did, how I think he did it, how I think his mom might've told him to, how fucking devastated I am and how stupid I feel. In essence, they told me I need to grow a spine, leave him, stop going crazy, and figure my shit out/decide what to do. Now a part of me feel like i migjt be overreacting. Im staying with my parents right now, they don't know what's going on. They're kind of religious, and I'm not exactly sure how they feel about abortion. I don't want to bring it up because I don't know how they'll react. BF has been texting me nonstop, telling me to calm down and come home and talk to him. I'm so fucking lost. Sorry if this is a mess. I'm not proofreading, I don't have the bandwidth right now.

Quick edit:
I'm terminating. I'm chronically ill, I'd have an extremely risky pregnancy, and I don't want to bring a kid into this environment. I've made an appointment, but I'm still so scared. I also had my friend gently prod my ex over text about what happened, and he didn't even have to do much. He bent immediately, saying he needed to get it off his chest and that he ""feels like a terrible person"" (he is). I am leaving that goddamn scumbag scourge on my life far behind me, he just doesn't know it yet.

1njhyh1,relationship_advice,My 24F husband 26M left me passed out on the floor while sick and then got mad at me the next morning. I see him different now?,"We've been married for a few years and have a baby. We had relationship issues after the baby but I thought we had resolved them and he promised he would be better and all that.

He did get better, he did his share around the house and house chores aren't a big issue because he just does what needs to be done without complaint or comment.

But something at the back of my head felt off. I never really explored the nagging feeling but now I realized that he never showed me any extra care. In fact, he gets upset or easily frustrated with me if I cause any extra inconvenience. Not sure how I didn't notice until now.

So 2 days ago, I think I got sick. I was feeling that gross thick skin feeling and (vertigo? Light headed? Idk) and by night time I was shivering and freezing. I was still able to function so I didn't think much of it. Complained to my husband about it and then we went to sleep. 

Yesterday, I woke up feeling like my bones were lead. Idk how I functioned yesterday but it felt like auto pilot. My boss messaged me with some tasks so I did them on my phone before my baby woke up. Rolled out of bed and somehow took my sister to school. Came back and worked some more. Usually I have energy to flip between being a mom and working but yesterday I just laid on the floor to work while my 1 year old watched some Ms Rachel. Then had to pick up my sister from school, come home to make dinner and by the time my husband came home, I felt dead on my feet. 

Anytime I moved, it felt like I was lagging and my body couldn't keep up. I told my husband this a few times. We ate, I put away the leftovers and put the baby to sleep while my husband went to his office to do some quick work.

After this, I don't really remember because my brain was foggy. I found myself in his office, we exchanged a few words but I don't remember what and next thing I knew, I woke up alone in his office on the floor.

I felt so heavy and out of it. It took so much effort to get up but when I got out, all the lights were off, the kitchen was not touched and he was in bed. 

I just stood in the kitchen and realized that he just doesn't care. I already knew he wasn't going to clean the kitchen tomorrow, and that he didn't care I felt off. I had a busy day planned and I didn't have time to wash all the dishes the next day..

So I loaded the dishwasher and then went to bed. I laid down and 5 minutes later, my husband (very angrily) told me to turn off the lights in the kitchen. At this point I had no energy to deal with him so I ignored him and fell asleep.

The next morning, today, I woke up covered in sweat but that gross feeling was gone. Thats when I realized that I was sick. My husband was upset with me. He wouldn't talk or look at me and was stomping around. I tried to ask him about yesterday but he just grumbled something about me ""confusing"" him.

Everything from yesterday caught up and I just can't see him the same. I realized that he has never taken care of me, or done anything that was inconvenient for him. I've been sick before and everytime it's the same thing. He gets upset at me somehow. 

After I had a baby, he was upset that nothing was kept up around the house yet got angry with me when I fainted from overexhertion at 2 weeks postpartum. I remember him yelling at me that I did this to myself and its my fault for not taking care of myself even though just 2 days before, he was telling me that he was angry with me for not keeping up with laundry and that I needed to clean the kitchen because it was starting to smell and he didnt want to cook anymore. Dont even get me started on how he never woke up at night. 

All these memories hit me and I just am disgusted by him. How did I not see this? What do I even do? I'm going to stop here before the post gets too long.

Edit: he just texted me saying he's beat and could barely brush his teeth this morning... I don't even know what to respond

I can't believe I took care of this man everytime *he* got sick and after 2 surgerys. ",6621,0.98,6621,0,6759.0,138.0,879,1758126618.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1njhyh1/my_24f_husband_26m_left_me_passed_out_on_the/,False,True
1hxaex7,relationship_advice,"UPDATE: The guy (22M) that I (21F) am dating is learning ASL for my brother, but my friends think it's creepy. How do I proceed with this? ","Sorry, this is gonna be a long one. This will be an update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hbrhz2/the_guy_22m_that_i_21f_am_dating_is_learning_asl/), but I'll also try to address some of the frequently asked questions.

TLDR of my original post: I've been dating a guy (Jon, 22M) for 5 months. This is my first relationship. He met my family 2 months ago and had befriended my brother (Trev, 19M), who is deaf. The two of them have been gaming with each other ever since. The guy I've been dating has apparently been learning ASL to communicate with my brother better. However, my friends said that his behavior could be seen as obsessive, emotionally manipulative, and downright creepy.

First off, I wanted to thank everyone who gave their insights in my original post. As I said, I'm very new to relationships, so reading insights other than my inner circle's was very eye-opening.

To begin, many Redditors said that my high school friends are conniving, untrustworthy, and ableist people who never bothered learning ASL despite knowing me for a long time. I take accountability for this. I'm not saying they're blameless, but it's not entirely their fault. For some context, our family moved to our area when I was in senior year of high school due to my dad's job. The friend group (2 guys + 2 girls before I joined) was already tight when I came in. They then took me in after we got grouped together for a school project, and they've been with me since (we've been friends for about 4 years now). They're not exactly saints, but they helped me survive my senior year in one piece. They are fun to hang out with, and they were the support I needed when I was struggling.

Also, during that time, my brother was having an especially hard time adjusting because of his disability, so my friends never really saw Trev a lot. To be clear, I was never ashamed of Trev. It's just that whenever my friends came over, he either locked himself in his room or was in a different area with his tutor and never really interacted with us. Whenever he does come out, he's really shy and awkward, so my friends mostly just get glimpses of him. By the time Trev became more comfortable in our area and found his own circle, my friends and I had already graduated from high school and don't really hang out regularly anymore. They're friendly and polite with Trev, but then again, they never interacted as much to the point of them actually needing to learn ASL for him.

Now, for the update.

Last week, my friend group had our year-ender party and I decided to bring Jon along to meet the rest of my friends. My other friend in the group also brought his girlfriend, so this wasn't really weird (others have done so in the past as well). I've commented in the previous post that Jon had only met my closest guy friend (I'll call him Mike, 21M), so I wanted the rest of them to form their own opinions of Jon after they've met him.

Initially, there was some tension and awkwardness from my friend group toward Jon. They were a bit cold, and they were throwing some harsh remarks toward him. Eventually though, they all warmed up to him, and they were actually pleasantly surprised by his personality. We all got along well, and we all even had fun in our games. However, I could tell that there was still awkward tension coming from Mike toward Jon and the rest of our group. He was throwing meaner jokes more than usual and he's kind of isolating himself from the activities.

The day after the party, I had lunch with my closest girl friend (Sophie, 21F) to clear the air because I could tell that they could also sense something was off.

A lot of Redditors speculated that Mike had a crush on me and was jealous of my relationship with Jon. Turns out, you're all 10000% correct, but it's a lot more complicated than that. Apparently, Mike has had a crush on me since our senior year high school. However, he's known in our school as a notorious ladies' man and had a new girl with him almost every month. This got exponentially worse during college. He had different hookups almost every night, and he even had a pregnancy scare with a girl last year. I knew about all of this because he bragged about sleeping around every time we meet up.

What I didn't know was that the entire time, Mike has been making up fake stories about me and him. Sophie told me that apparently, Mike and I had a pact that if we were still both single when we're 30, we'd marry each other. Also, he told our friend group that we hooked up after graduation and that he took my virginity then, so he's ""my special person"" (whatever that means). He also told them that we'd been secretly hooking up consistently throughout college (for context, Mike and I go to different universities that are just about 30 minutes apart). Lastly, Mike told them that I said I'm in love with him. He told our friends not to tell me anything so I don't get embarrassed or upset since I have this image of being somewhat of a prude.

Mike also told our friend group that when he met Jon, he thought that Jon is a total jerk who has been manipulating me and taking advantage of my innocence and naivete. He said that Jon had been forcing himself into my family and is driving a wedge between me and my friends. Mike also said that after he had lunch with me and Jon, he tried to convince me to stay away from Jon because he's not a good influence on me, but Jon had effectively brainwashed me. This explains why my friend group was already so antagonistic toward Jon when I told them about him.

For the record, none of what Mike said was true. There was no pact, we never hooked up, and I have NEVER been in love with him.

After that, Sophie and I asked the rest of our friend group (except Mike) to jump on a FaceTime call with us. They all shared different versions of what Mike told them (there were a lot more), but I disputed everything. We were all collectively shocked about everything that we learned that day. They apologized for their behavior toward me and Jon, and I told them I understood given all the lies fed to them by Mike. Then, everyone agreed to kick Mike off the friend group. Sophie suggested that maybe we could have an intervention for Mike first, but I just said that I didn't want anything to do with him anymore. The rest of the group agreed, so we're essentially cutting him off. Sophie said she would still talk to him just to inform him of everything that happened, but I really just wanted to distance myself from him.

Now, it's been a week of being Mike-free. Sophie said that when she and our other guy friend talked to Mike, he became extremely defensive, confrontational, and aggressive. He wasn't physically violent, but he called them names, attacked their characters, and made such awful statements about everyone in our friend group that I won't include here anymore. It looks like cutting him off completely was the right call.

Now, for some more uplifting updates.

After reading everyone's comments in my previous post (there were a lot!), I reflected on my relationship with Jon and my friends. I then talked to my parents for advice, since they have the best relationship I know of. They told me that from what they saw of Jon when he visited our home and how I spoke of him, it seems like he is a legitimately nice person with pure intentions. It also helps that Jon and I have been friends for months before we started dating, so I already knew his character even when there was less pretense of him trying to impress me (he's already impressive on his own though lol).

I then told Jon about everything that happened and apologized, fully expecting him to be mad at me for doubting him and his intentions. Instead, he said he understood, because of course it was just natural for me to trust my friends and expect them to have my best interests. He then asked me if there was any point in our relationship when he I felt uncomfortable or uneasy around him, and I categorically said no. I told him that he's my safe space, and he has nothing to worry about. He then reassured me that his intentions with me are genuine, and he even said that he sees a future with me, which I reciprocated.

Also, Jon and Trev's friendship is still going strong. Trev has participated in one of Jon's D&amp;D sessions with his friends, and Jon and I both acted as the translators. We were delighted to see that most of Jon's friends already know ASL alphabet! Apparently, they had even included it in the lore of their D&amp;D campaign. Also, Trev had been asking Jon some tips for working out and getting fit lately since they have the same body type but Jon is more toned (one of his brothers is a fitness instructor).

Also, I met Jon's family for the first time for their annual get-together. It was super fun! There were games and contests. Also, I wasn't prepared for it but apparently, since their mom is a theater performer and their dad is a music producer, it was their family tradition to have a talent showcase. They gave me a pass this time, but they told me I should prepare something impressive for next year lol Jon and his brothers performed Bye Bye Bye by NSYNC (in full Deadpool, Wolverine, and Captain America costumes), while his sisters and their husbands did Defying Gravity from Wicked. Their parents did a medley from the Sound of Music. It was a total blast! I felt their family's warm welcome, and they really treated me as one of their own. I could see where Jon got his good values and looks from (though I think I need to start taking voice and dance lessons to keep up with them lol)

So, that's it for this update. My relationship with Jon is stronger than ever, and I finally know who my true friends are! If you've made it this far, thank you so much for your time! Happy New Year to us all!

TL;DR - My male best friend has a crush on me and has been making up stories and feeding lies to our other friends, tarnishing the image of my boyfriend. I have cleared things out with my other friends, and we've cut off our toxic friend from our friend group. My relationship with my boyfriend is now stronger than ever.

EDIT:

Just had lunch with the rest of my friend group. We all compared notes about Mike's lies. Apparently, he concocted extreme fantasies about every one of us. He has been stirring unnecessary drama for years, and even caused the breakup of one of our other friends with her then-boyfriend. Mike also told them that apparently, I threatened to cut ties with our friend group if any of my ""secrets"" come out, which was why no one really confirmed anything with me. He also said I was having mental health issues because of it, but Mike said he's helping me out, so there was no need for them to be concerned. Through the years, I could recall Sophie and our other friends checking up on me and making sure I'm okay without really referencing any of what Mike said. Some of their statements didn't really make sense to me at the time, but I just chalked it off to college stress. Our other guy friend also made remarks about me and Mike, but again, I chalked it off to friendly teasing. Now, everything is clear to everyone, and we're all ready to move on from this. There's still a lot of processing to do, but at least we now know the truth.",6596,0.98,6596,0,6733.0,137.0,264,1736420584.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hxaex7/update_the_guy_22m_that_i_21f_am_dating_is/,False,True
1lcr0gt,relationship_advice,How do I (27M) tell my friend (27M) that he'll never date an influencer-like girl?,"Hi everyone. This is a sensitive topic, and I want to approach it as respectfully and compassionately as possible.

I (27M) have a friend (also 27M) whom I've known since our freshman year of college. He's never really dated, at least not that I'm aware of, and he never seemed particularly interested in pursuing anyone seriously. He’d occasionally mention girls, but it was always in a vague or surface-level way.

Two years ago, I broke up with my long-term girlfriend and re-entered the dating world. (That’s been a whole journey of its own, but that’s another story.) Since then, he’s started talking more about dating and women. I think he now feels like we’re in the same boat, and honestly, I’m glad he’s opening up more.

Here’s where I’m struggling: My friend is an amazing person: funny, smart, thoughtful, a great cook, and he has a solid job. But on a purely superficial level, he’s not conventionally attractive. Some people might even consider him ugly. When we were younger, that kind of thing might have mattered more, but now that I’m dating again, I’ve realized how much broader and more complex attraction can be at out age. There are so many different kinds of beauty, and what I find attractive has definitely evolved since I was 18.

Unfortunately, my friend doesn’t seem to see it that way. He only seems interested in women who look like Instagram influencers: very stereotypically hot. And, being brutally honest, those types of women are typically looking for guys who match their aesthetic; and he just doesn’t fit that mold.

It’s starting to really hurt his self-esteem. Not dating is making him feel like he’s worthless. I’ve tried to gently steer him toward more realistic and fulfilling possibilities. For example, a friend of a friend often compliments his cooking. I suggested he ask her over for a homemade dinner sometime, and his response was, “She’s ugly.” That really bothered me. At our age, I feel like we should be past this superficial mindset and actually see people for who they are.

I don’t want to shame him or be cruel, but I also don’t want to sit back and watch him spiral because he’s chasing an ideal that isn’t going to happen. He’s not going to date or hook up with a supermodel-type woman. That’s just the reality, and it’s okay! There’s someone out there for him, someone who will love him for who he is. But he’s blocking those possibilities because of his narrow idea of what’s attractive.

How can I talk to him about this without sounding condescending or mean? I want to help him see his own worth without reinforcing unrealistic standards. Any advice would be appreciated.",6443,0.98,6443,0,6577.0,134.0,846,1750075427.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lcr0gt/how_do_i_27m_tell_my_friend_27m_that_hell_never/,False,True
1kves4p,relationship_advice,I (29F) am planning to leave my completely financially dependent and toxic partner (34M). How do I warn him that he needs to get it together?,"My partner and I moved out of our home state 4 years ago when I got a job. He has not had a job since, and I struggle significantly to get all of the bills paid. He spends a hundred or more dollars a week on weed which makes it more difficult, and I have to pay for everything. He complains about my cooking, but doesn’t cook either so we have to eat out often. He gets in very foul moods where he slams things, yells, calls me names, etc. 


At the beginning of April I told him I don’t want to be with him anymore. I also told him if he reacted aggressively to my feelings, I would plan to leave him without warning. He reacted aggressively, by slamming things, and then I decided to work outside of the apartment because he was being so loud and I work from home. He found the cubicle where I was working in our building, barged in, got in my face and called me a whore among other things. When I made the comments in April, I promised myself that I would leave. 


I believe that part of the reason he reacts so negatively to me saying these things is it means he will lose access to housing, food, a car, etc. He doesn’t talk to his family. He does have one close friend whose family he can maybe stay with although I’m not sure. My partner will be out of town for a week or less this summer, and I plan to pack up and leave then. I don’t know how to go about this, and what I should say (if anything) given his previous reactions. My therapist connected me with a DV org, who is going to help my break my lease. I don’t know how to go about telling him he needs to start taking action to support himself, given his reaction in the past. 

He will not know where I am going, however he does know where my mom lives and that kind of freaks me out. 

Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up as much as it did. I will be leaving in July and will update this post. I plan to look at it whenever I start doubting myself. Thank you to everyone who gave such helpful responses. Also things are generally amicable as long as I don’t bring up breaking up. He can be cruel if I’m loud in the mornings and wake him up, but as of now we are getting along okay since he doesn’t know my plans. I’ve even been asking if he needs help paying for his trip and he does not suspect anything 

UPDATE: today is July 26, so I think about 3-4 months since I posted? I am in my own apartment, no contact with my ex, and working on healing. The universe was on my side and my ex ended up getting a decently paying job, and last I heard he has his own place. When I informed him of my desire to split, he was really upset, and tried to convince me he knew of all his wrongdoings and had changed his ways after 3 days at his new job because he no longer had to stress out about money. He is blocked now. And I am feeling hopeful about whatever the future looks like.

1mlzruy,relationship_advice,[UPDATE] My (25f) boyfriend (27m) called me selfish for wanting him to leave his boy's night early due to me grieving. Where do I go from here?,"Here is my original post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1mk89z6/my\_25f\_boyfriend\_27m\_called\_me\_selfish\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mk89z6/my_25f_boyfriend_27m_called_me_selfish_for/)

I want to start off by saying thank you so much to everyone that commented. I spent a good while reading every single comment, so for everyone that gave me advice and shared their stories, please know I am extremely grateful for you. I also really appreciate everyone that gave me their condolences. Now for the update. 

A little while after posting, one of my boyfriend's friends reached out to me. He asked me if I had posted it, because if I did, he had something to tell me. I said yes, and he told me before my boyfriend left their boy's night, he had started complaining about me to everyone there, telling them I was being a psycho and forcing him to leave. He completely lied about my relationship with my mom and told them I wasn't close with her at all, rarely talked to her, anytime I mentioned her I did nothing but shit talk her, and that I was using her death as a way to control him. I also learned throughout our entire relationship he'd tell his friends about every fight of ours and again would completely lie about everything that happened in them. For context, I am not close with any of his friends and he had apparently told them I was ""faking"" my personality whenever I interacted with them and shit talked them when they weren't around as well (ironic), so I don't necessarily blame them for believing it. The only reason why his friend reached out was because my boyfriend had done the same thing in past relationships, and he was starting to get suspicious (and tired) of it. 

I confronted my boyfriend about it afterwards, and he denied everything for a while before ultimately admitting to it all. He started crying, saying he doesn't know why he's like this but that he loves me, can't live without me; anything and everything you can think of. I packed whatever I could and told him I needed time to think. I'd be staying with my brother in the meantime as I had to drive out to go to my mom's funeral and go through her things (so, for the few that asked if I had another support system, my family lives a few states away as my boyfriend and I started out long distance, and I moved away from them a couple years ago for him. The few new friends I made are away traveling for the summer, which I couldn't join in on for numerous reasons. I also couldn't get out of bed for the majority of the week so I didn't leave sooner). 

What he didn't know at the time was that I didn't need time to think, and I had already decided I would not be coming back. As I said in my original post, there was nothing awful worth noting about him during our relationship. He didn't treat me exceptionally well, but not terrible either. So, prior to his friend reaching out, I genuinely didn't know what to think of the situation. To me, it was out of character for him. My main thought was the news of her passing might've hurt him a lot as well and he didn't know how to handle it. But, I now know that he was an entirely different person with his friends, and what was out of character for me, was completely in character for them. It definitely scares me to think of what would've happened if I didn't post and never learned the things he was saying when I wasn't around. I also have no clue what I'd do if another life-changing event happened and he put something else above being there for me. 

So, to everyone that wanted an update, just know I have completely removed him from my life. No amount of tears and fake apologies will convince me otherwise. He wasn't there when I needed him and that's enough, but the lying and fake stories he'd share on top of that is terrifying. I know my mom would rip me a new one if she heard all of this and I did anything other than leave him lol. I will always be grateful for this little corner of the internet and the awful future it saved me from.

1jnzvf4,relationship_advice,"UPDATE: Finally meeting my (29m) online ""girlfriend"" (29f) after years of talking, it's not going well.","Yesterday morning I woke up, made the original post and waited nervously for her to wake up. It once again took a couple of hours, a little after noon she finally messaged me.

She said we had dinner in the later afternoon with her mother, and I could Uber over to her place whenever. A few of you suggested I should just call off the dinner plans but I decided to stick it through.

I went up to her place shortly after that and we spent some time watching things. She was having a better day so we sat close and while we didn't -do- anything (brother was in the small house) it was some quality time I had been looking for.

Dinner with her mother was great, we connected well and she seemed to be genuinely excited for me and her daughter. We left with a hug from her mom and went back to her place.

It was a lot more of the same thing as before, so while it wasn't alone time with her, it did feel more on on one, and we had a good time. Was it exactly what I was expecting on the last day of this trip? Not really, but was it nice? Definitely. 

It was getting late and I was half expecting her to want me to Uber back but she drove me herself, she helped me confirm my packing for the flight early this morning, and we ended with a kiss.

We got to texting a bit and we realized she hadn't taken a photo of us for a frame she had bought. I was pretty sad that we hadn't and the few pictures of us from that weekend didn't really fit the vibe she was going for. I mentioned that I should just Uber back. 10 minutes later waiting for a response and she tells me to come down, anxiety be damned she did drive back just for the photo and another goodbye smooch.

So, overall, it wasn't the perfect weekend, but I'm going to stay cautiously optimistic. I think it was a mistake to not make the trip longer, and think that would have helped even more. We'll see how things go when she has to decide if she wants to make the solo trip down here for an event closer to this summer. 

To clear some things up; She is on medication and goes to a therapist (though her current therapist is very new to her). Normally I wouldn't be into a LDR but our likes and interest align well, and it's something I've struggled to find around me back home. My last relationship was decently long and taught me that was something I valued a lot.

Thanks for all the comments on the other post. I imagine interest for another update will wane by the time the next trip happens (in about 2 months) but that is the time where things will really be make or break.

Tl;Dr - Last day went decently well, her mother was lovely and I could tell she was trying to make a bit more of an effort. We are still planning to meet again for an event by me in the coming months, that'll be make or break.

Thanks again.

1nzygce,relationship_advice,"UPDATE: My (f26) ex-bf (m27) said he was gonna propose for the last 4 years. When I finally found the courage to break it off, he did. I don't know if I should give it another chance?","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/YXF9701njA

**Hi all. Earlier today, I made a post asking how I should navigate this situation. A short summary would be that my bf of almost 13 years and I seperate after the idea of marriage was dangled in my face for 4-5 years. We remained separated for 2 months before he suddenly reached out, proposing.**

Many suggested I wait, but I already knew what the correct choice was. A lot of hard truths being pointed out to me made it hard to ignore. 

That said, I had the ring. I never told him “yes,” rather “I don’t know.” But he insisted I keep it. Given I decided I needed to move on, I wanted to meet so that I could give him his ring back. He agreed to at first, but was insistent on it being at either my place or his. I was already at the park with the ring in my car and just wanted a neutral meeting place, so I said no. 

He argued that it must not be “that important then,” so I said “okay, I’ll give the ring your mom when I have the chance.” He didn’t agree to meet but this did make him FaceTime me, so we spoke that way. I was okay with that. 

The call started with him trying to negotiate a meeting location for a moment or two. Once he gave up, I told him I had questions about our breakup period. He told me I “live in the past,” but quickly backtracked when I said “okay, never mind” and attempted to hang up. 

He told me I wouldn’t like the answer to some stuff, and he’s right. He admitted that he saw 4 women during the two months, two of them being a threesome. He alleged to have wanted that experience before marrying me. 

He also claimed that he felt inferior to me in the recent years because of how “put together” I am, as if he’s much different. 

I was in shock. I’d spent these last two months alone and trying to heal while he’s having threesomes? It hurt, but it felt more like a disgust hurt than a betrayal one. Not because of the threesome, but because he thought he could just come back when he was done “having fun.” 

He asked me to come back to his place. He said “the kids” (two goldfish) miss me. I told him that I can’t get back with him. I need to experience something new just like he did. He’s all I’ve ever known. But saying this upset him and might’ve given me some real insight into how he felt. 

He called me selfish. I’m always thinking about myself. He brought up a time I went to the gym on his birthday, early in the morning before proceeding to spend all day with him. He said I constantly make unilateral decisions, “like this one.” He accused me of being with another guy and said that’s why I don’t want him to come over. 

I should have hung up earlier, my choice was already made. Once he’d known I was set in not rekindling, he was only looking to hurt my feelings. My father offered to return the ring so that I don’t have to, and I’ve been advised to call the police if he shows up at my place again. 

Despite this, I feel good. I got some answers and saw what happened when he didn’t get his way. Again, I appreciate the advice! ",5911,0.99,5911,0,5971.0,60.0,257,1759792035.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nzygce/update_my_f26_exbf_m27_said_he_was_gonna_propose/,False,True
1oec8ys,relationship_advice,My 25M girlfriend’s 24F “conventionally attractive” friend 23F did a “loyalty test” on me. I'm not sure how to continue with our relationship.,"I 25M have been dating “Becca” 24F for six months now. Everything was going great until her birthday two months ago. Up until then, I’d met a couple of her friends but just one or two at a time. This was the first time meeting a lot of her friends, and the first time I’d be hanging out with them all in a big group. We had what I thought was a great night until that night when I took Becca home.

Becca asked me what I thought of her friend “Sadie” 23F. I’d exchanged maybe two sentences with Sadie, so I just said that she seemed cool. Becca then asked me if I thought Sadie was pretty, to which I responded she was, but not nearly as pretty as Becca. I thought that was a safe answer because I didn’t want to say her friend WASN’T pretty, but I also wanted her to know that I only had eyes for her. But Becca was like, “So you DO think she’s pretty. I KNEW it. Pretty AND cool!” I didn’t think much of this because Becca was quite intoxicated, so I just brought her some gatorade and helped her get into bed.

I figured Becca wouldn’t remember this interaction the next morning, but she called me and apologized. She explained that Sadie was “conventionally attractive” and had a history of taking men that Becca wanted, and she didn’t want that to happen to me. I assured her that wouldn’t happen. I told her the honest truth, which was that with all the new faces I was seeing, I hardly remembered what Sadie looked like. I told her too that if Sadie kept going after men she knew Becca wanted, she should consider distancing herself from Sadie.

Again, I thought that would be the end, but for the past two months, Sadie has somehow come up in every conversation. Did I follow Sadie’s instagram? Had I talked to Sadie since the party? Even when I give her a compliment, she brings up Sadie. Just last week she got a new pair of jeans and I told her how great her butt looked in them and she went on this tirade about how she had to spend so much money just to get a pair of jeans that looked “decent” on her while Sadie looked like a “supermodel” in Walmart jeans.

I’m not THAT dumb. I know that Becca has complex underlying issues and that the Sadie fixation is just a manifestation of those issues. I don’t want to invalidate her, but I get the sense that Sadie is not a problem so much as Becca’s insecurities. I’m like a broken record with how often I remind her that she’s hot and smart, that she has a great life, a great job, and a great guy (if I do say so myself lol) and there’s no reason for her to compare herself to Sadie or anyone else. That Walmart jeans are trash but I’m sure she would look good in them if she really wanted some. I’ve suggested therapy, which she says is ""a waste."" It just seems like nothing I do helps. And I know it’s her issue and not mine, but it’s starting to drain me too.  
  
The breaking point came a couple nights when I got an Instagram DM request from Sadie saying she thought I was cute and asking if I wanted to hangout sometime. This was followed by a series of DMs basically saying she knew I was with Becca but she thought I could do better, and if I gave her a chance she could “show me what I was missing.” Without responding, I took a screenshot and immediately blocked her. 

Then yesterday I showed Becca the screenshot. I fully expected Becca to crash out, but instead she kissed me and told me she KNEW she could trust me. I was confused and she explained that she had Sadie DM me to prove my loyalty to her. Apparently it is a common thing for women to do, especially if they have a “conventionally attractive” friend who “could probably steal anyone’s man.” I was completely dumbfounded. I thought people only did this stuff in movies, not in real life.

I asked Becca if all the anxiety over Sadie was real, or if she had faked that too. She said it WAS real, but now that she knows I’m loyal to her she’s not worried anymore. She tried to kiss me again but I pulled away. This might have solved all of her problems, but it created a whole new set of problems for me. I gave her no reason to doubt my loyalty. I never even looked twice at Sadie. I did everything I could to show her how much I cared about her, but it took this fake DM for her to trust me. What if she made another “hot” friend? Or what if she thought one of my co-workers was “conventionally attractive.” Would we have to do this all over again? 

I told her I needed some space. Becca doesn’t understand why I’ve been distant since yesterday. She seems to think everything is resolved since I “proved my loyalty,” but ironically I think this may be the breaking point for me in the relationship. I really like Becca, but I can’t be with someone who has zero faith in me. If I’m going to stay in a relationship with her, I need to communicate to her how deeply this affected me, and make sure that she knows not to do this again. How can I do this without invalidating her feelings and making her turn against me?

  
TLDR; My girlfriend has been fixating on her friend who she thinks it much more attractive than she is. I have no interest in this friend, but she had her friend send me suggestive DMs as a ""loyalty test."" This is making me question our relationship, and I need to effectively communicate to her that she hurt me without making her upset.

UPDATE: 

A lot of you have been asking for an update so here’s what happened the past few days. I read most of the comments and a lot of people were telling me to drop her, ghost her. Some of you even told me to fuck Sadie. To be truthful I was not planning on doing either of those things. Some of you were calling me spineless and saying I had no self respect, but Becca had so many redeeming qualities despite the stupid test. I thought she was one of the kindest, smartest, most beautiful, driven people I knew and even though we’ve only been dating for six months, she’d been there for me in ways none of my previous partners have. If there were other red flags, I would’ve just ended it, but there were none, until yesterday. 

After a couple days of minimal communication, Becca asked if we could meet up to talk. I had thought out how best to say I understood her anxiety but that her behavior wasn’t acceptable, but I wound up not having to say anything because she apologized. She told me a lot of things about herself and that she knew what she did was wrong but also hoped I’d understand why she acted that way. It was the first time she’d gotten candid with me about this. For her privacy I won’t go into detail, but let’s just say she’s been through a lot and more than explains (but not excuses) her behavior. She even showed me she had booked an appointment with a therapist. 

I was ready to put this past us, but she let it slip that the account that DMed me was not actually Sadie but a bot account she made to impersonate Sadie, and that Sadie had no idea those DMs were sent. This was so appalling to me that I ended things on the spot. I can handle anxiety and other mental health issues but to impersonate someone online is something I can’t move past. Becca tried calling me and texting me a couple of times afterwards but she’s stopped. Even through her delusion I think she knows it’s over. Genuinely I wish the best for her. She has some great qualities but she is seriously messed up in so many ways. I hope she gets the help she needs, but I can’t help her anymore.

I have stage 4 cancer. Diagnosed about a year and a half ago. My step daughter, 17 got her license a few months before I was diagnosed. As soon as she got her license and didn't need me to drive her anywhere she has decided I'm the worst person ever, because I asked her to clean up after herself when she was growing up. Part of this is she completely ignored me and acts like I'm not a person that lives in this house.  It's really great for my feelings when I'm literally afraid I'm dying of cancer daily. Keep in mind I practically raised her as a single gle mom and did EVERYTHING for this girl when she was growing up.  Took her to every single girl soccer practice and now I'm not wanted at her games kind of stuff. It's ridiculous and not fair. 

So after everyone left our house after Christmas brunch I wanted to chill in the living room and watch a movie. I didn't want to go nap in the room with my husband  because he naps for 20 minutes and then lays there on his phone tossing and turning and making all kinds of noise while I'm still trying to nap. 

Well apparently my step daughter wanted to use the living room as well. So now he is mad that I chose to take my space and use the living room that I pay half the rent for. And I wouldn't give it up for a 17 year old that walks around here treating me like absolute crap.

For those who didn’t read the first post here it is -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/U9YwaI307N

Some of you commented (and most DMed me) saying it could be something shady like cheating, guilt, etc. I really didn’t think that was the case, but my overthinking got the best of me. So last night I went through his phone. I know, not nice of me, but I was just so curious and he doesnt even have a password. I wasn’t even expecting anything crazy, maybe just a ton of porn or something. I found nothing weird though. 

While I was doing this, he woke up, looked at me all sleepy, and said, “Is that my phone?” I panicked and just said “Yeah.” He literally just mumbled “Oh,” rolled over, and went back to sleep.

In the morning, he didn’t say anything about it, so I was like, “Uh… aren’t you gonna say something about the fact that I went through your phone last night?” And he didn't even understand what I was saying.

I reminded him, and he laughed. He genuinely thought I was just watching a movie or show (I sometimes use his phone for that if mine is charging), so he didn’t even notice I was snooping.

At this point, I just told him everything, how I got paranoid, why I checked, how I was worried something was wrong. He got quiet for a second, then kind of shyly admitted that he thought I was enjoying all the extra sex, so he just kept initiating more. But the real reason, he said he sometimes feels disconnected from me.

He’s very introverted, doesn’t talk to many people, keeps his circle small. Meanwhile, my entire job is social (I work in PR), and I spend a lot of time with my coworkers. He admitted that sometimes he feels like I have this whole world outside of our relationship, and since he’s not super talkative, he worries he doesn’t always connect with me the way I do with others. Sex, for him, is one of the most intimate things we share, so in his mind, having more of it made him feel closer to me.

I almost cried when he said this because I never thought of it that way. I reassured him that just because I talk to a million people a day doesn’t mean I don’t prioritize him. And we both agreed to make more of an effort to connect outside of just sex, more quality time, deeper conversations, little gestures. I also promised to communicate better if something is overwhelming me instead of silently suffering and then having a breakdown about it (lol).

Basically, I love him soo much.",5711,0.98,5711,0,5830.0,119.0,201,1741015390.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j2l2s9/update_my_25f_husband_27m_suddenly_wants_too_much/,False,True
1m58jiw,relationship_advice,Boyfriend 35M humiliated me 31F camping with friends. I don’t know if I should stay?,"My boyfriend 35M and I 31F have been together for 3 years, living together for one. We’ve been friends since high school, so there’s a long history between us.

Over the weekend we went camping with friends, and two things happened that really shook me. First, we were setting up a bug net together. He had been drinking and suddenly started taking it down. I assumed he was adjusting it, so I helped remove a part that was stuck. I saw him putting it in the bag so I asked what he was doing. Then he snapped, “You took it down, so we’re not using it.” I was confused and said, “Wait, I thought you were taking it down, I was just helping.” He got snippy, handed it to me, and said “Whatever,” so I quietly put it back up.

Later, I was starting a fire to cook and casually asked a friend to grab me a stick to move some logs. Out of nowhere, my boyfriend jumps in and says, “I’m no idiot, but here,” then starts aggressively messing with the fire using an axe. He turned to me and said, “This is the hot part of the fire, this is the cooler part. You fucking got that?”

I was stunned. “You fucking got that?” I just stood there silently. When my friend returned with the stick, my boyfriend started loudly saying that I talk to him like he’s an idiot. At that point, I told my friend exactly what he said to me, with him standing right there. He tried to defend himself, I told him to shut up, and he stormed off to take a nap in the car.

Later he came back to camp and ignored me completely, talked to everyone else, not a word to me until we got home the next day. (We drove separately) Then he said, “Sorry I lost my temper.” I took a shower and when I got out of the shower, he said “we should have a talk” then proceeded to say how I am so mean to HIM.

It led to an argument. He said he was drunk and anxious all day and regretted saying that as soon as it came out of his mouth. I brought up how this is a pattern, he lashes out, minimizes it, or tries gaslighting me into believing I behaved the way he did and not him, and apologizes vaguely. He said he’d stop drinking again and wants to fix things, but I don’t know if I believe that anymore. He’s said it before.

I feel humiliated, confused, and emotionally exhausted. I’m trying to do better at not just cutting everyone out of my life when things go wrong. Has anyone been in a relationship like this? Did it get better, or did you leave?

1kqpfuy,relationship_advice,My (M28) girlfriend (F26) nearly drowned because she was starving herself  to look better for me,"I don’t know where to post this. But I need advice. 

Last week me (M28) and my girlfriend (F26) were at my parents’ place just hanging out. She was chilling in the pool and I was playing with the dogs. I stepped inside for a second to grab a drink, came back out, and she was gone underwater.
I jumped in and pulled her out. She was completely out. I did CPR and mouth to mouth. I thought she was about to die in my arms. Then she gasped, started throwing up water, shaking, and crying. I’ve never been that scared in my life. That image is stuck in my head on a loop.
A few hours later in the ER she was finally stabilized. When I saw her, she didn’t even know what had happened. I told her she cried, thanked me, said I saved her life and she was beyond grateful. I asked what happened and she just said she felt dizzy. That’s it.
Next day she gets discharged and I try to get more out of her. I asked if she ate anything that day. I already knew she’d been skipping meals for a while. She lied at first but then admitted she hadn’t eaten in like five days.
She said she wanted to look good in a bikini since she knew we were going on this trip. She just didn’t think she’d pass out. I lost it. I screamed at her. I called her stupid. I regret that so much. I apologized later but at the time I was just mad and scared.
She cried and said she was sorry. Then she said she feels fat and didn’t want me to feel disgusted. That’s insane. I see her naked almost every day. I love her body. We have a great sex life. I’ve never given her a reason to feel insecure.
I knew she wasn’t eating much but I didn’t think she was literally starving herself. She was already skinny when we met but now she’s even smaller and still says she feels fat.
I’m just pissed at myself. I love her so much. She means everything to me. She’s the kindest, sweetest, most amazing girl I’ve ever had. I tell her I love her all the time, and she still thought she had to starve herself to look better for me. I guess I stopped telling her she’s pretty because I thought she knew. She’s beautiful. Everyone tells her that.
We haven’t really talked about it since but I know we need to.
I just don’t know how to start the conversation.
I don’t know what to do. How to start the conversation? 

EDIT: I talked to her and she admitted she’s been struggling with eating for a long time. She also told me that whenever we go out or have a date and she eats more, she ends up starving herself for the next few days to make up for it. That hit me hard. I always thought she enjoyed those moments, and now I find out she’s been punishing herself after.
I brought up treatment and she said she’s scared but she wants to get better.

My wife and I have been together for 2 years now just got married recently. We are compatible in every other way except when it comes to her idea of gestures and how she feels love.

She actually really likes traditionally romantic things. It doesn’t come naturally to me but I oblige because it makes her happy. One of the things she wanted me to do on one of our dinners together was for me to “pick her up” in my car, get her flowers, open the door for her and other stuff she wanted me to do. We live in a very convenient spot from which we can get things delivered in just under 5-7 mins through the online app. 

I had forgotten to get flowers for her so last minute I just ordered it off the app. They were beautiful and she said she is really happy about the gesture. I said no worries I can get you flowers everyday. Somehow I ended up blurting out that I ordered it off the app.

Her expression immediately changed and she said she doesn’t feel special anymore. Like it was as good as gifting her a bag of doritos because no real effort went on my part.  She angrily said she would’ve felt at least a little special had I placed an order directly from a florist I had researched on first the app I ordered flowers from is the same app she orders stuff on a whim when we run out such as bread and milk. 

I was feeling frustrated at this point and admittedly got mad at her because it felt so silly and I felt unappreciated from the lack of gratitude when she said my “gesture” doesn’t feel thoughtful anymore. 

I said: 
“Was the gift thoughtless or are you thankless?” 

She started crying. I ended up leaving her in the car downstairs in the complex and headed upstairs as I no more felt like having dinner with her.

1l3955c,relationship_advice,I (37f) gave my husband (39m) an ultimatum about his hobby. How do we move forward?,"Spouse and I have been married 15 years and we have three kids under 10. We've both always been into fitness, but my husband is always looking for ways to do more. Last year he trained for, and completed, his first triathlon.

We were all pretty proud of him and glad he had the experience, but the training really kind of sucked for us at home. He spent over three months working out nearly every day; it was incredibly time consuming. He'd spend hours a day. For example, some days he'd work his job and then come home and do a 3 hour bike ride or run. There were many days when he flat out didn't see our kids at all and I really felt like a single mom.

About a month after his triathlon he starting talking about how he wanted to do another right away. I immediately asked him what his plans were for triathlons and he said that he'd like to do them continuously throughout the year. I told him that if that was the case, that I really didn't think I could do that and that it might be best if we part ways.

He was incredibly upset and indignant- told me I was unsupportive and trying to sabotage him. He said it was unfair to make that demand- that if I was dating someone I would never ask them to quit their hobby. And he's right- I wouldn't but I would still absolutely peace out because their hobby is incompatible with the life I'm looking for. 

I didn't really feel like I was even making a *demand*... I was just stating a fact that it was really hard to support the family alone while he trained and that I couldn't see myself doing it *forever* if he wanted to become a triathlete. Even though it was ""unsupportive"" on paper, I feel like the most supportive thing I can do in this situation is to step away and let him do what he wants and chase his dreams.

He eventually agreed to drop the triathlons because we're the ""most important thing"" to him... but it's been *months* and he still finds ways to make snide comments about it or will bring it up out of the blue if we argue. I can't tell if he's just feeling resentful or if he's trying to get me to feel bad and change my mind about it. 

At any rate, I still feel the same way and there's no chance I'm going to change my mind. How do we move forward from this?",5569,0.96,5569,0,5811.0,242.0,1236,1749052423.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l3955c/i_37f_gave_my_husband_39m_an_ultimatum_about_his/,False,True
1j0k73l,relationship_advice,UPDATE: My (27M) wife (28F) returned from a work retreat with a hickey. She swears it’s a bug bite but I’m not convinced. I’m at loss. How do I move forward?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/wXeBWvmXLm

I (27M) wanted to give an update and thank everyone who reached out. The outside perspectives helped.

Things are a rollercoaster. I’m trying to process. It took a while for my wife (28F) and me to have any real conversation about the bruise on her neck.

We were stuck between arguing and her showering our daughter (4F) and me with affection.

I rarely saw the bruise because she was turtlenecked up. But I did note the healing process from reddish purple to yellow.

There wasn’t any more discussion about the Vegas retreat. She made it clear she was done talking about it and that she shouldn’t need to defend herself to her husband.

I told her she could do whatever she wanted, but I was done being treated like an idiot, and I wasn’t sharing a bed with someone I couldn’t trust.

So I moved into the guest room. Communication stopped. The silences were palpable. Even our daughter noticed. I’m not proud of that. I try keeping her out of fights.

My wife came to the guest room one night and asked if we could talk. I could tell she’d been crying.

She said she hated the way things were between us. She felt she was losing me either way.

I told her I needed complete honesty. She confessed she hooked up with that coworker (23M) on our daughter’s birthday. The hickey was from him.

She was lost in the heat of the moment and didn’t realize he was sucking so hard on her neck.

By her account, they made out while doing some on top of the clothes stuff and then he went down on her.

It stopped there because he called her by a nickname that I affectionately call her. It snapped her back to the reality of her actions.

She went to splash water on her face and saw the hickey. The guy made light of it and made a joke about the hickey being her souvenir. She blew up on him and kicked him out of her suite.

Part of the reason she was avoiding me was out of guilt. She said she’s coming clean because she doesn’t want to hide things anymore.

I asked her why she cheated. What was it about that guy she deemed worth risking everything?

She claimed it wasn’t him specifically, nor is she unhappy with our marriage. She doesn’t really know how to explain it, but a part of her feels broken.

The more she looks in the mirror, the more she sees her dad (57M). A cycle of being consumed with work, distant from child, and the infidelity he put her mom (55F) through.

She said her family never talked about anything openly and how when she was growing up, my MIL never addressed anything with her.

I said her parents didn’t make her cheat. She chose to party up with a guy who constantly disrespected our relationship. These were all her decisions, and she at any point could’ve chosen our family.

She agreed. She wants to blame her parents but realizes this is on her. She apologized for cheating and for entertaining the guy’s advances.

She said she’ll do whatever it takes to repair. Go to HR, quit her job, counseling, anything. She wants to make everything right.

I told her I don’t know what right looks like or if that’s possible for us anymore. I knew we had our problems, but I thought there wasn’t anything we couldn’t talk out.

She insisted we still could talk it out. We didn’t have to give up on us. She tried giving this rally cry for our relationship, but I felt very numb.

I said I didn’t recognize her. Not just the betrayal of our vows but also how she treated our daughter. She’s like a stranger.

She feels she failed as a wife and mom, but she loves us both beyond words and wants our life together and our family intact.

I told her I couldn’t give her the answer she wanted and thought we needed to separate and reevaluate.

She didn’t want separation. She felt we should stay together in our home, but I told her a separation was happening. Either she was leaving the home or I was with our daughter.

She consented to leaving so as to best not uproot our daughter so much. She asked for our daughter not to be taken away from her.

My wife’s staying with my in-laws. I know that’s difficult in itself because she doesn’t have the best relationship with her parents.

One of the hardest parts is the shift for our daughter. Right now, she believes her mom’s just busy with work per usual. She hasn’t questioned it too much.

My MIL called the other day. She made no excuses for my wife, but she’s advocating for us to work through it.

She told me times when she heard my wife describe me as the anchor she always wanted. She believes there’s something worth fighting for if I’m open.

Despite some family opposition we faced throughout our relationship, my MIL was always a supporter of us.

I’m even more at a loss. I never imagined this kind of betrayal from my wife. She was my safe place. I feel numb yet broken.

I’m in love with her. That hasn’t changed. But I don’t see myself, her, our relationship, or our family the same. Everything’s more tense because it’s fresh.

I think this period of separation is for the best. I’m not sure about divorce. I haven’t let myself fully go there. I’m not set either way.

I don’t know where things go from here, but I’m focusing on our daughter and taking things one step at a time. I feel that’s all I can do right now.

Thanks again to everyone for the support. It’s much appreciated.

TL;DR Update for: My wife returned from a work retreat in Vegas with a hickey on her neck. She swears it’s a bug bite, but I’m not convinced. I only feel more strongly when I consider how distant and weird she was during the retreat. We’re stuck between arguing and her dousing our daughter and me with affection. I’m at a loss.

1i431vp,relationship_advice,My(F19) biological mom is 35. My dad is M45. Words cannot express how I’m feeling.,"If you do the math, you’ll see that my bio mom was sixteen and my father was 26 when I was born. I never knew this. So I’m really disappointed at the moment. 


I never really knew my mom. She and my dad split when I was three &amp; the memories I have of her are very distant. My dad remarried when I was six to my step-mom (F42) &amp; together they had three more kids. In my household, it was no step or half, we were simply just family. Did I ever wonder about my bio-mom? Yes and no. I was raised in a tight-knit home, so I never felt like I was really missing something because my step-mom also raised me, but I sometimes wondered about the woman who I’m supposedly a carbon copy of.


My dad RARELY talked about my mom. From what I knew, they got married when they found out she was pregnant, and she left I reached out first and we met up for the first time last week. I was so nervous. I felt like I made a mistake, but she explained to me her story. My mom was a troubled teen &amp; she left home. She and dad met when my mom was fifteen, shortly after she ran away from home. He offered her a place to stay, and it wasn’t long before they started a relationship. She said that she was miserable at the time. She didn’t want a baby—me, she didn’t want to be married, and she realized she made a mistake. She said the marriage was so bad, and it was really unhealthy. So one day, at the same exact age I am right now, she left. She moved back home and restarted her life. 


I’m so angry. I’m so angry about so many things. I was groomed when I was fourteen by an adult &amp; luckily my dad caught the situation fairly early before any serious damage could happen. The way my dad handled it was amazing…yet it turns out he is the same exact person I escaped. And also, I’m regretting meeting my mom. I keep dodging text messages, which isn’t fair as I’m the one who reached out out to her, but I’m regretting it. Why did I find it necessary to meet a person that didn’t go looking for me? It wasn’t what I thought it was going to be. I don’t know how to process this wave of emotions. How do I? The person that I usually go to for advice on things is my dad, but what can I do now that I can’t even go to him?


I’ve been doing well, you know? I’ve been in therapy since my early teens, but as of 2 years ago I’ve been doing so well. Now, it feels like I’m in a rut. It feels like I’m mad at everyone and all the angry emotions are just piling on. How do I process everything?

1nmddxv,relationship_advice,My (f29) cousin (f29) has convinced herself that my husband (m33) is in love with her. How do we deal with this?,"My husband “James” and I got married a little over two months ago, and this has been going on since then. 

We had a pretty small wedding. I have a huge family but invited less than half of them for personal reasons. One cousin “Mira” i was unsure about inviting but, she was going through a hard time and I thought inviting her would help her get out of her depressive funk. She is recently divorced after her husband of 2 years cheated on her and kicked her out of his home. 

At the wedding, everything was pretty normal and nothing crazy happened. Relevant detail here is that during the wedding reception, my husband and I did a little segment where we dedicated songs to each other and they were played with an announcement stating that I dedicated one to him, then he dedicated one to me. The song he dedicated to me was “Adore You” by Harry Styles. We are both Harry Styles fans, and that is my husband’s favorite song. 

Because of the lyric that says “brown skin and lemon over ice” Mira thinks he was secretly dedicating it to HER and not me, her reasoning being that she has darker skin than I do, which is true, but it was NOT meant for her. And also, INSANE thought process. 

Ever since then she has been telling people that her and my husband are seeing each other behind my back, and bragging about dating him, which she is not doing. My husband had only met Mira once before the wedding, at Thanksgiving four years ago, and they didn’t even speak to each other apart from  saying Hi. 

Mira has been posting poorly photoshopped pictures of herself and my husband, and took photos from the wedding and cropped me out of them and plastered them on social media bragging about being with my husband. 

We have both asked her to stop and she blocked me and ignored him. My family members are split: the ones who weren’t invited are saying I deserve this and this is my karma for not inviting them to my wedding, my cousins all think Mira is crazy, and my aunts/uncles who WERE invited say that I should just ignore her since I know she’s lying. 

This is driving me and my husband insane, and yesterday (Friday) she showed up at my husband’s job to bring him lunch and told everyone she was his girlfriend, which led to confusion since most of his coworkers know me, and 3 of them were at the wedding. 

I literally don’t even know what to do at this point because this is so stupid and insane that I’m dumbfounded. I would appreciate some advice; how the hell do I handle this??

EDIT: Thank you all, I got a lot of advice very quickly so I’m going to speak to my husband about all of your ideas.

So, I made a harmless comment the other day. I told my boyfriend he kinda had a “marathon runner” body — not as an insult, just a light comment. He got annoyed, but I thought it was over.

The next day, I told him I had gone to the gym and ended up vomiting twice — it was a rough session. Instead of checking in on me, he brought up my comment from the night before and threw it in my face: “You say I look like a marathon runner but you can’t even handle one workout? How often do you even go to the gym?”

Then he said something that made my stomach drop: “I’m not comparing, I’m just putting you in your place.”
I don’t even know how to describe how that felt. It was condescending, disrespectful, and it felt like he needed to win something at my expense.

To make it worse, we had talked about how I love cherries the day before — and in the middle of this argument, he goes, “You know what? I’m not getting you cherries. You don’t deserve them.”

I really appreciate you guys. 

The post I’m referring to is the following. My boyfriend (24M) and me (22F) have been together for almost 2 years now. Aside from some small bumps in the road, we have been in a very good place throughout the whole relationship. However, last night things escalated, over - in my opinion - something super dumb. But he thinks differently of that, and now stopped talking to me. It started when we were on bed, he was gaming and I was on my laptop looking to order a new perfume. Since I stopped my job (to focus on studying) I don’t have as much income, so I decided to not get the expensive perfume I usually go for, Miss Dior. I thought it’d be better to find a body spray with a resembling scent. As he was looking over my shoulder he asked me what I was doing, so I explained. He then reacted saying I wore Miss Dior in our first period of dating and it is “my smell”, and how it was one of the things that attracted him to me. I must admit this made me a bit annoyed, because I’d rather get that perfume too - but it’s just not responsible to do so right now. He started rambling on how I care more about saving money than I care about him. I said that’s not true, but then he kept saying his hypersensitivity issues can’t deal with adjusting to a new scent. I said I’d find a scent similar to my old one, but he wasn’t content. At this point he said he’d have to break up with me if I would go for another scent. I found this hilarious and thought he surely must be joking so I laughed, which made him go silent. I let him be, because I was really annoyed, and we went to sleep. Now he left early morning and doesn’t respond to my texts or calls. I have no idea what to do and I’m starting to doubt how I handled the situation. 
Any advice?

UPDATE:

Wow, first of all, thanks everyone who gave me advice (and some tough love). I did not expect so many of you to help me and definitely teared up at some of your replies. After I posted this I was a bit of a mess, but after hours of ignoring me he texted me late in the evening and asked me to meet up, because he does not want us to be in a bad place. I really wanted to talk to him, at least to clear things up, so I went to his place. When I got there he acted a bit disappointed still, but he did say he didn’t want us to fight. I felt the same, but also took your advice to heart: the idea of letting HIM buy a bottle. However, for some context, I do think he might be on the spectrum (no diagnose but his dad is too, and it’d make sense) so I did want to show him I care and take his hypersensitivity seriously. Therefore I decided to suggest we pay half/half for a new Miss Dior and then until that one would be finished, I’ll make sure to do research to find a really good dupe. 
He was not as convinced, told me it wasn’t my birthday anytime soon. I explained that I understood but we’d have to both compromise. Well, to quote his literal words: “If you’re such a feminist, you should be so financially too”. This got me fuming. I had no words, so this time I left. As per your advice (in the replies), I did some thinking about the rest of our relationship. I realised other things in our relationship that at the time didn’t sit quite right with me, were situations of him being controlling and self-concerned, situations I always considered as little things he’d mean differently or would learn from. I was wrong. You were right. I asked him to meet up today and I dumped his ass. I feel terrible right now, but I know I’m better off. So, anyone advice for a cheap, nice body spray?

1mhrw7j,relationship_advice,I (25F) lied to my boyfriend (26M) about his dick size,"So I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for a couple months now. He's actually one of the sweetest guys I've been with, he plans surprises, he cooks for me, he massages my feet after I get back from runs, just a walking green flag. I feel really safe and cared for with him. It's been really refreshing, especially compared to some guys I've been with before. And I've had my fair share of experience, like well into double digits. He know, and it's never been an issue. I could tell he was curious, a little intimidated maybe, but I always told him it didn't matter.

Recently, while we were having a pillow chat after sex, he asked me how he compares down there compared to the other guys I've slept with. I laughed it off and tried to dodge it with a joke, but he insisted. I told him it didn't matter because I'm with him now, but he kept pushing, said he wanted to know. I said fine, and started thinking. He insisted that he wanted full honesty, that he wanted us to be be 100% transparent with each other, so I promised I'd be 100% honest. Eventually, I told him he's ""a bit above average"". He thanked me for telling him.

The thing is, it was a lie. I couldn't bring myself to be honest, because as far as I remember, he's the smallest I've ever been with. Not by a little, like noticeable smaller. I don't remember every single hookup perfectly, but yeah, I'm pretty sure.

To be clear : I don't care, and I'm perfectly happy with him. Like I said before he takes care of me in other ways, and I'll take a sweet, attentive man over good dick any day.

Still, I just couldn't get it out, I didn't want to humiliate him. It’s been gnawing at me, because I promised the truth, and he trusts me.

Last night I was out alone with my son (he’s a toddler) and a weird strange man approached me and made me and my son very uncomfortable to the point the restaurant staff had to get involved to remove him. 

I get home and tell Brad the story. Instead of asking if me and my son are OK. He proceeds to say “it’s because you’re pretty haha”, sends me multiple selfies, and says he’s excited for our date tomorrow (which is today). 

I don’t want to see brad anymore, how do you cancel the date? What would you say without writing a person a decade older than you a storybook? I want it to be firm, short, non explanatory (I’m not explaining a grown man why his behaviour is innapropriate).

She got pregnant, we moved in together, and it was horrible. It all ended when she told me my daughter wasn't mine...and I was relieved at the time. I was 20. I left. I went on with my life,I went to college, got married, and built my life. 7 months ago, a teenage girl contacted me claiming I was her father. I explained to her how she was misunderstood, but she insisted. So we took a paternity test, and she's mine. The baby that I walked off on nearly 2 decade ago is mine and I missed all of those years. 

Not only that, but she was pregnant, just like her mother was at her age. Her mom kicked her out, and she found me after that. She moved in with us 5 months ago, and my grandson is now almost 3 months old. It was essentially like I'd become a father and grandfather overnight. It hasn't been smooth sailing. My wife has been supportive, but it's taken a major toll on our relationship. We went from a quiet home to sleepless nights and emotional tension. We never planned for this, and I can tell that my wife is becoming resentful even though she denies it. She doesn't want to talk about it. I need to talk about this with her because I feel her slipping away. 

I love my wife. I love my daughter that I’m getting to know. I love my grandson. There's so much guilt on my end because of all those years I missed.  I don't know how to hold all of this at once and I just need help. I feel guilt, confusion, and like I’m failing everyone. P.lease help with advice because I need it bad.

1ltroqr,relationship_advice,My girlfriend (21F) and my brother (20M) are soulmates,"My girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) have been dating for about 7 months now. We both used to work at the same restaurant, and I asked her out. I've always felt like we were very different people, but that's what I liked about our relationship. I feel like I'm always learning something by being around her and try my best to indulge in her interests. 3 months ago I introduced her to my family and they all seemed to like her, especially my brother (20M). I didn't really think much of it, and was happy to see them get along since I'm very close to my brother. But I've realised over time that they just fit way better with each other. They both have the same interests in movies, books, music, sports, foods, you name it. Although my girlfriend was hesistant at first about it, I encouraged her to go for things alone with my brother if it wasn't something I was really into. And they both had a great time. 

And I know just having the same hobbies sounds trivial, but it's also their personalities. They're both very free spirited and adventurous, and I can't help but notice that they look so much happier with each other than with me.

1hdwv57,relationship_advice,I (42m) left my wife (42f) after she kept making comments about me not being manly enough and not sure I did the right thing? ,"We’d been together since we were 18. She was my first everything where as she’d been with a few people before me. We have an 18 year old daughter together who is and amazing brilliant and kind person, I couldn’t have asked for a better kid. 

The last few years my wife has been making the odd comment about my manliness etc and I’ve just brushed it off but she’s really stepped it up the last year and I ended up leaving her about three months ago over it. 

I don’t want this to sound like a humble brag but I do think I’m quite “manly” while also just being a normal person. I’m tall, workout a few times a week, I can do any DIY around the house, I can fix cars, i used to be an amateur boxer and cage fighter and still do it as a hobby to keep fit. The things she said that aren’t manly about me are: 

I like to bake 

I like to cook 

I don’t drink, I don’t care if other people do it’s just not for me 

I like Taylor Swift, Charlie XCX, Arianna Grande, Sabrina Carpenter etc. my main choice in music will always be rap but having a teenager daughter these sort of artists get played and I like some of their songs so I listen to them. I don’t see that as a bad thing 

I have a powerful car and a motorbike but my preferred method of transport is a VW Up. It’s a small car with a little engine but if it’s just me and my gym bag or work bag I don’t see the problem plus I’m not one of them who feels like a car someone drives means anything. My ex wife disagreed and said I give off a certain vibe in it. 

I tend to walk away from arguments with strangers. She perceives any slight as personal insult. If you cut in front of her in traffic she’s leaning on the horn, don’t say thank you if you hold a door open, she’s screaming and shouting at you. I just prefer to let things slide. An example is someone was being obnoxious to me on a night out for no reason. He was in my face calling me all sorts of names and even pushed me a couple of times. I just smiled at him and walked away saying I hope he gets home safely. When we got home she said I embarrassed her in front of her friends by letting him talk to me like that. I said what’s the point of me knocking out a drunk kid who’s half my size. She said I’m a doormat for the world. 

There’s a few other things mainly connected to stuff me and my daughter have in common around stupid social media videos. She said it’s like living with two teenage girls 

In September I left her. I said I can’t be spoken to like this anymore and be belittled. It’s not fair. Even then she had a dig and said a real man would change. She’s changed her tune since and said she’s willing to go to therapy both individual and couples and try and sort out her issues. 

I don’t know if the cuts from things she’s said are too deep though? Since I’ve left I’ve felt more relaxed and happier. I don’t have to worry when I put a song on or want to bake a cake or cook something a bit different what would be said etc. At the same time though it’s scary as she’s all I’ve known and being alone and meeting new people scare the life out of me as I’ve never done that before. 

Everything is telling me I’m on the right path now but I have a niggling doubt in my head that all those words she spoke about me are true and I am an annoying person that will be alone forever. 

TLDR: I left my wife for constantly questioning my manliness and now I’m scared of the future.

His last relationship ended because he was cheated on and he’s always very passionately preaching to his friends about how you should just break up with someone instead of cheat. So it literally makes no sense that he would cheat. But over the weekend when I went to visit him istg his mouth smelt like someone else. We were kissing and it wasn’t anywhere else in his face except his nose, lips, and a bit on his chin, but I TASTED it… look not to be crude but I’ve munched box before. It’s got a very distinct taste and smell that I am familiar with. I also found a pack of cigarettes that are a different brand than his near the foot of his bed, but aside from that and a few minor things not adding up it’s not like there is any concrete evidence that he has been cheating on me or with who.

But then again he was literally cheated on so i don’t know. At the end of the day I already KNOW what I tasted, but I also thought I knew who I was dating. So does anyone know if there’s any other things on this planet that taste and smells exactly like a woman’s private parts?

1jnfcc9,relationship_advice,"Finally meeting my (29m) online ""girlfriend"" (29f) after years of talking, it's not going well.","I'll add a short tl;dr after both of the sections

Context:

A couple years ago I (29m) met a girl (29f) through an online circle, we talked frequently and it was always a great time. She's very passionate about a lot of the same things I am and is very career driven which is something I'm looking for. Early last year she opened up about having feelings for me, which I was receptive to. We started spending more time online together and eventually it got to a point where she would be telling her coworkers and family members about her ""boyfriend"", this didn't bother me too much, I'm very interested, but for me I had to meet her to seal that deal.

Fast forward to Christmas and my gift to her was going to be a trip up to meet her (USA to Canada).
Trip was very expensive but worth it. We had talked about me going to meet her a few times, thought it was better that way as she has a lot of anxiety (very important for later) and health issues that would make it much harder for her (esp in this current political climate).

Well that trip happened this weekend. I'm currently typing this out from my hotel room, which I've spent the vast majority of my time here alone in.

Context Tl;Dr - Met a girl online, developed feelings, great match for eachother, she lives in Canada and me, the US. For Christmas I set up a trip to come see her. She has terrible anxiety issues.

The main issue:

The trip to see her started off how I expected. I don't know this city at all, it's a country I've only been too a few times, and I was nervous myself. Took a 40 minute Uber to my hotel and expected by the time I got there that she would have worked out her nerves and be ready to meet me. Unfortunately her anxiety was extra bad and it took her another 2 hours to work up the courage to drive 5 minutes to come see me. This didn't bother me at the time, I knew it'd be rough and I'm a patient dude (for the most part).

We met, she was shaking and bawling her eyes out, but overall it was great, some hugs and we drove to her place. She lives with her brother so I was able to meet him and we chilled out for a little while. Her anxiety was still through the roof though so we didn't actually do much for the next couple of hours, she wanted to drive around and show me some stuff but couldn't, eventually she decided I should probably Uber back instead of her driving me.

Next morning I was up extra early, she usually works nights so I figured she wouldn't be up for a bit. Not knowing the city I chose to stay in and wait till she was awake. 4 hours later she messages me, we talk for a bit and she tells me she's not quite ready to see me as the nerves are still there. That's fine, I found a drug store in walking distance I can pick some stuff up at and get us some food at a local spot before meeting up. Fast forward about 2 hours later and I finally get back to her place. She doesn't eat anything and tells me her brother, her, and myself are going to go to a get together and hang out with a bunch of their friends. That's cool, I ask her how long we'll be there and she said a few hours. We leave, it's about an hour drive. Everyone of her friends were great, super welcoming and she seemed really happy to introduce me as her boyfriend. Little party lasts a good portion of the night, we don't talk much as I'm usually getting bounded by her friends or she's playing a game or something. It's around 10 when we go to leave, still plenty of night left I figured, she tends to be up till 3 or 4 in the morning so I was pretty pumped to get to spend the rest of the night together. However as we get in the car she asks her brother if it's cool that she takes me to the hotel before they go home, he says yeah, and I just get to sit in shock the whole way back that she's too drained to spend a couple of hours of quality time with her ""boyfriend"" she just met. At this point it's all starting to catch up to me and I'm feeling pretty bad.

I get back to the hotel room and I'm just -confused- by this whole trip. I'm alone, in a hotel room, in a country I don't know, with my ""girlfriend"" a few minutes away, not knowing what to do. What the hell is going on? I fear messaging her about it is going to make her anxiety worse, but at this point I don't know what to do. I'm set to meet her mom in the evening for dinner, and at this point I feel like I've met everyone except for my ""girlfriend"". So I message her that. She's very apologetic, saying her anxiety is through the roof still and she wanted to make this trip worth it for me but she's just drained. She makes an effort to let me know she is still very interested and everything, but she knows if we're alone together that nothing would happen because she's just too nervous, she hasn't been in a relationship in a couple of years so it's hard for her. I tell her I don't even want to try anything intimate if that was her fear, I've barely hugged her this trip and there's a lot more steps in that process before anything like that could happen. I just want to spend some quality time together. She said tomorrow after I meet her mom there will probably be time.

All that said, today is my last day here. I leave early tomorrow morning on a flight. I feel like this whole thing has been a waste and I'm still just confused. I wanted to spend quality time with her, not sit on a hotel room alone for most of my trip. In my mind she would want to be with me every waking moment of this trip, our time is so short, we've talked about it for ages like that was going to be the case.. 

I don't know if the relationship can last after this.

Tl;Dr: Planned a trip to meet up with my online ""girlfriend"". Trip finally happens but her major anxiety issues have made it so I'm spending most of my time alone in a hotel, in another country, instead of with her. Everytime we go to hang out I'm just meeting someone new instead of spending quality time with her. I feel like I've met everyone here except for her. She still seems super invested in the relationship but I just feel confused and a little heartbroken.

I'll update after we see how this last day goes.

1jt7u3l,relationship_advice,Am I (27F) overreacting to a secret my husband (28M) just casually let slip on a date?,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years, together for 12. The thing I have always loved most about this man is that he adores me and is always 100% honest with me.

Well, we just got home from a date. I’m still sitting in the car wondering if I’m crazy. But, there was a time when we were about 23 years old where I really wanted a baby. We tried so hard for about a year but it never happened. Honestly, I can admit now that that idea was out there and I’m genuinely glad we didn’t conceive then because our lives are so great now and at this point I don’t even think I want kids. 

Anyways. On our date, he mentioned that time period where we were trying/ and he let slip that every day before we did it he would j*rk off so that there would be less of a risk that it would actually happen. I think he admitted this because I was just talking about how glad I was that we didn’t have kids. So he felt comfortable admitting that. 

I was to taken aback and started crying mid date. I know; it sounds dramatic; but I feel like I just learned that he’s never been 100%honest with me like I thought. Why not just talk to me then and say “hey; I don’t think it’s the right time” instead of manipulating me? We did it every single day during that time and now I just am questioning everything. 

He’s acting like it’s no big deal and that I’m just overreacting but I feel extremely hurt right now. So, am I blowing this out of proportion? 

UPDATE: hey everyone, I wanted to let everyone know what transpired last night following this post. I go SO many helpful comments and I appreciate them all. Some comments were very ‘out there’ and dramatic (even for me ;)) but I still appreciate the time it took to read my post and reply. 

I saw some common themes so I wanted to clarify some things. Firstly, I did reflect back on that time and realized that I did have baby fever. And while he NEVER outright told me he didn’t want a baby, I can see now that he wasn’t as enthusiastic as I was so that could be on me for being so focused on what I wanted. Secondly, I was NEVER upset that he didn’t want a baby or even the way he went about it, the only thing that hurt my feelings was the withholding of information and not being direct with me. 

Following the initial hurt of the situation, we did sit down and talk it out. We have grown, and I explained my feelings to him. He apologized and understood why I felt hurt. We’re going to be fine. I made it clear that in the future, he doesn’t need to do something just to make me happy if his heart isn’t in it and we both agreed to be more direct with one another. 

We read some of the comments on this post together. Some made him open his eyes to how I was feeling (thank you) and others made us laugh out loud because they were a bit extreme (also thank you because laughing together helped us 🫶🏼) 

And yes, we now know that is NOT an effective form of birth control ;)

1jfzo1c,relationship_advice,"Update - My(33F) Husband(36M) may have cheated on me with my dead best friend, and had an affair baby?","I've received a lot of messages asking for an update, so I've decided to finally sit down and write one out. As you can imagine, after the cluster fuck that was thrust upon us, this update isn't likely to answer any of your questions, only present a few more.

I want to start by telling you all that I love, and trust my husband. My reaction to ask him for space to think, in retrospect, was wrong...but at the time I didn't know what to think. It was a combination of losing my best friend again, and also the fear that I was losing my husband, that sent me spiralling.

Again, it was a mistake to ask him to leave, and I did rectify that in the end.

Now, for the update.

As mentioned in the original post, I did take a leave of absence from work and we spent a long time just being together. Talking, reaffirming our love for one another, and figuring out what to do next.

We of course spoke with a lawyer, and my husband was very adamant about not having anything to do with the child, but was willing to offer financial support as needed.

So we agreed to do a DNA test immediately to prove paternity, and then go from there. Didn't know you could buy tests on Amazon, but with only a few weeks processing it was the easiest path forward since Alexis lives hours away.

To everyone's surprise, Alice's daughter is *not* my husband. We ended up testing twice, both very, very definitive. 

The first test we performed ourselves as mentioned, and another after Alexis refused to believe the first test, and took my husband to court for child support. 

For a single second this whole thing made me second guess if my husband was raped; that this could have been her way of forcing my husband to admit to an affair...but after talking with Alexis, I don't think that was the plan.

Alexis says that Alice told her my husband was the father under strict confidence, demanding that she never, ever tell me or my husband. We were only ever to be told if Alexis died before Alice's daughter was old enough to take care of herself, so that she wouldn't end up in foster care.

The only reason Alexis came to us then, instead of keeping that secret, is because Alice's life insurance wasn't being released yet, and she was out of options. She also felt I should know my husband and her daughter had had an ""affair"".

This all reaffirms in my mind that Alice did rape my husband, with the expectation of getting pregnant with his child. She obviously had other partners at the time, since one of them fathered her daughter, but no one knows who. It's clear to me that Alice believed it was my husband.

I did suggest Alexis upload a sample to Ancestry, see if any matches pop up, but as Alice traveled all over for work, I don't know that anything will ever come of that.  In truth, I've washed my hands of the situation. Alice did enough damage, and I don't particularly plan to be around for any more.

My husband and I have gone through a lot of counseling, and will likely continue for a while. This whole situation damaged us both, my husband more obviously, and I don't think we'll fully heal for a very long while.

To answer a few questions;

No, sadly there isn't a hidden diary, or texts to explain what the fuck was going on.

My husband and I are not getting divorced. He understands why I reacted the way I did, and has been strong when I was weak before. I've spent the past 7 months being strong while he was weak, so we're considering the whole thing even. We are still madly in love, and plan to be together for a long time still(more on this!!).

No, we will not be adopting Alice's child. If she had been my husbands, we would not have been adopting the child.

Ultimately I thank reddit for setting me straight. There was a massive outpouring of support, and corrective advice; to say I got a slap in the face would be a descriptive but apt way to put it. I needed it then, and I thank you for it.

To say that you may have saved my marriage is an understatement.

I do however, have some good news!

During my leave of absence, while my husband and I rediscovered what makes us love eachother the most...I got pregnant. We're expecting our first baby, a girl, in a little over 3 months, and my husband and I are ecstatic!

And no, we will *not* be naming her after my dead ex best friend.

TL;DR: Not my husbands baby, not our problem. No answers, just questions, and oh, I'm having a baby!",4840,0.97,4840,0,4994.0,154.0,178,1742504800.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jfzo1c/update_my33f_husband36m_may_have_cheated_on_me/,False,True
1j9xv3d,relationship_advice,[Update] What do I say to my (45F) bf (44M) who doesn't seem to realise he's just broken up with me?,"Original post


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/CBWRNhGB0r

Thanks for the answers. I replied to as many as I could but eventually it got a bit repetitive. 

To those who never saw my replies and have the same questions:
His kids were happy to see him when we met, but as the divorce became more acrimonious, they started to say things that (in my mind) children wouldn't typically say. 
If he had said anything about his children not wanting to see him when we first started dating that would have been a red flag for me. 

Helping a friend through a divorce and listening to them go through various ideas is very different to the person you see doing it. Especially when they are talking about things that means the end of the relationship. 

Anyway on to the update. 

We met up and I asked him if he was aware that he said he thinks he wants to have more kids. He said yes, it's a possibility. I said you're aware that I'm on the waiting list for a hysterectomy. He said yes. 
I said ""So you're aware that this essentially means we're over?""
He said,  ""it doesn't have to mean that, we can continue to see each other until I make up my mind.""
People. I nearly fell off my chair. 
I stared at him and realised that he actually never knew me at all. Anyone who knows me knows I would never put up with this foolishness. 

I actually laughed and said you want me to continue to see you while you decide whether or not you want kids? And then if you do, I should just meekly walk away? Does that sound like that's fair?

He said no, but he loves being with me and doesn't want to lose me. 
I told him I was lost the minute he told me he might want more kids. I said I appreciate him telling me the truth, but the consequence of that means we're over. 

I told him what I'd have told a friend (sort out your relationship with the children you have before making new ones) and gave him book on that subject. 

I left and cried. I'm going to miss him a lot. 
He's been texting, but I may block him soon.

1kyjmtg,relationship_advice,I (28F) found a woman’s sock in my house after being away for a week and my boyfriend (30M) lied to me about it.,"UPDATE 2: We broke up. As a lot of the comments have said too, it wasn’t really about the sock anymore. Maybe I won’t ever know what happened while I was away, but the violence in his response was frightening and I don’t want to be with someone that makes me feel unsafe in my home. It wasn’t the first time I’ve seen him that angry, but it’s the first time that he’s done something so physical and I don’t want to be involved if it continues to escalate. He’s been taking some of his stuff while I’ve been out of the house (and one of our dogs which has been probably the most upsetting out of all of this) and I’ve been changing the lock code after each time. I have some friends that live nearby that I’ve explained the situation to and they’ve assured me I can contact them if I ever end up in an unsafe situation. Thank you to everyone that has offered advice, shared their own experiences, or expressed concern for my safety in the comments. There will be a lot of changes in my life upcoming due to this but I know it’s for the best.

UPDATE: I don’t know if I’m allowed to update in less than 48 hours as per community rules. But he woke up. I’m sitting here in my office area, doing some work but also periodically crying and reading the comments here. He came into the room and tried cuddling me from behind my chair. I was obviously stiff and he asked me why I was mad at him. I said that I didn’t know why he wasn’t honest with me earlier about the sock. He said he didn’t lie to me. I said I put the sock there on the table so he couldn’t have. He said that he’d meant he’d found the sock while cleaning and he’d tossed it aside (landing forgotten behind the shop vac). He then got super mad, saying that I’m always accusing him of cheating. Swearing around and saying that he’s not coming on our trip to my parents’ house during the summer and that he’s staying at the house all summer and that a friend of mine who was supposed to rent the house for work during the summer can’t stay there then because he’ll be here. I asked him why he was getting so mad and said that I’d been upset and I just needed an explanation and reassurance from him. He continued to lose it. Stormed towards the door and threw his cup full of coffee down the stairs. Grabbed an old baseball bat that we keep by the stairs and started hitting the step outside the door yelling that he’s “not fucking cheating”. Threw his lunch that he’d packed for work all over the steps and peeled off in his truck. 

ORIGINAL POST: 

I was away for a week for work. He was off work nearly this entire time as he works one week on, one week off. When I came home, my boyfriend had cleaned the house up quite extensively. Obviously not a crime in itself, but it was surprising and a little out of character. I usually have to do most of the cleaning, so it was unexpected. He’d even picked up some of my laundry that I’d left in the washroom and living room and put it in the basket. I was surprised but I didn’t think much of it. 

He started night shifts the day after I returned and I was working days so I came home from work after he’d left. I figured I’d spend some time cleaning the house too as he’d done. There’s a shop vac that’d been sitting just outside of our bedroom door for a few weeks that I finally moved to the closet. When I moved it, I found a sock just behind it. A small ankle sock, obviously women’s in a brand that I’ve never seen before. I had a bad feeling by this point but I put the sock on a table by my bedside and continued cleaning, intending to ask him about it when he returned from work early in the morning.

When I asked him whose sock it was, he said he didn’t know. He then said he found it on the stairs and thought it was mine, so he put it there. But I put the sock there. I doubt he’d even seen it around the house or else it wouldn’t have been behind the shop vac. And if he had seen it and thought it was mine, wouldn’t he have put it in the basket with my other clothes that he’d put away?

I told him that I put the sock there and asked him why he lied about putting it there. He said he didn’t have anybody over and he didn’t know whose sock it is. I left and got ready for work and he went to sleep.

1oppfax,relationship_advice,My Friend (18M) almost accidentally KILLED me (19M) How do I move forward?,"This is a hard thing to talk about as it only happened a week ago. My family owns a crossbow that we usually shoot at a target on our property. While my father got it, it's considered to be mine for use. I am quite skilled with the crossbow and have fired it innumerable times, and am very careful. It is not a killing weapon, but it's not a toy and shooting it in a critical place could be lethal. It didn't shoot actual arrows, but more like pencil sized darts with relatively sharp metal tips. I had brought friends over before, including my best friend (18m) to shoot at the target with me before with no issue. This is because I very clearly explain that it isn't a toy and to exercise caution. One day my friend called me up and asked if we could shoot the crossbow. Unfortunately I said yes.

In retrospect the warning signs were there from the start, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened that day. He showed up shortly after calling and I was there set up and ready for him. From the start he wanted to begin shooting the target, but I slowed him down and went over the protocol of how to fire it and how to put the safety on. He kept giving me quick responses of how he remembered how to do it, and I gave the demonstration myself. Now we had done this before, so it wasn't a complete red flag that he wanted to speed through instructions, but I wish my judgment was better. He fired it off a few times and hit the target with no issue. Then I went to grab more darts from the dart box which was BEHIND the direction of the target, essentially completely opposite to the line of fire. 

It all happened in seconds: I felt a sharp thud hit my head and my vision go black for a moment, but there was no pain. I remember looking at my friend with the crossbow in hand and wide eyed as a deer. I began to scream as I instinctively pulled the pencil sized dart from my head. I have to say I may have been more in control than he was while I was bleeding from the head, as he froze in shock and I yelled at him to call 911 which he did. My adrenaline was through the roof and i didn't actually feel the injury but I knew I was bleeding. Very quickly both police and medics showed up on the scene and I was fully lucid, and understood that I hadn't sustained a serious injury, however, the place where I was hit was an inch between my eye and temple. . . I told the police it wasn't intentional as my friend could barely speak out of shock. I went to the hospital but was let out very quickly.

It's been a week and my friend called to ask if I was ok at the time I was in the hospital, but we haven't talked since then. There was so much dangerous stupidity from him that I can't understand how he had his safety off and had TURNED AWAY FROM THE TARGET, FACED ME, AND SHOT. Can I ever be his friend again?

1iwtp44,relationship_advice,My (45M) gf's (44F) boss/friend showed up to her house unannounced on Valentine's Day with a card and chocolates while I was there. Did I handle this poorly?,"We were getting ready to go out for the day, the front door was open, and she says ""oh, X is here,"" ""come on in, X."" He walks in and hands her a box of chocolates and a card with her name handwritten on it followed by ""love."" I had never met this guy before, but had heard of him since they've been friends for almost 10 years. The whole thing felt surreal. I observed his behavior and he seemed a bit nervous, and she as well. She introduced me to him as her boyfriend. I kept my cool and he stayed much longer than I felt necessary, close to 20 minutes.

After he left we left as well. While in the car I said ""that was weird - what was that all about?"" She said ""oh, that's X, he probably did that for other girls, too."" I disagreed, saying that it seemed romantic in nature, and that I felt he was interested in her. She said I was overreacting. I told her I was bothered by the fact that he did not know she had a boyfriend even though she's known him that long, and also that he just stops by without even calling or anything. She got defensive and turned it around on me saying I didn't trust her. We got into a major blowout. Things are on the rocks now. I am not sure if how I should have handled this. It was the most awkward thing I've ever encountered, and upsetting.

1o5oe2v,relationship_advice,*Update* I (f28) found a child’s shirt in the belongings of my fiancé (M33),"Not sure I’m formatting this right but just wanted to update for those still messaging me and commenting. This is probably anti-climactic for most of you and in hindsight maybe obvious but PLEASE refrain from the negativity or “i told you so’s”  in the comments, trust me I have beaten myself up enough, nothing can be said that I haven’t thought to myself already

Someone here suggested I suggest getting cameras to him and gauge his reaction. (thank you so much if reading, I lost you in the sea of comments lol) He was very against it and jumped to the conclusion i was trying to catch him in something. A reaction that took me by surprise. After that I said f**k it and went through his phone (another popular suggestion) Something neither of us had done since knowing each other so I’d watched him put in the code from the corner of my eye and then went through it when he slept. Found a woman he’s been calling/answering calls from while he’s working maybe every other day. After my hands stopped shaking i called from my phone and asked who she is, she asks me who I am and i tell her I’m his fiancé. She tells me she’s the mother of his kids and that he’s a father of 2 boys and a girl, 10, 7 and 5 years old. That they met in college and have been on and off since then but they are currently just coparenting (an obvious lie) She then tells me she was told about me and he’d said i was pregnant?? And pretty much moved here at random against his will. That I was just a crazy one night stand while they were on break and he was just trying to coparent. Basically playing this role of the heroic father (to a fake baby) trying to do right. when in reality he’s just a psychotic POS. She seemed more relieved I wasn’t pregnant than anything 🤮 but that is her issue. Told her about the shirt and she’d said her kids spent the weekend, another lie because no one has even been here since i’ve moved in. Didn’t even seem to care he hid his own children from a woman he was going to marry. Anyway he doesn’t know but i’m leaving, i’ll be using my little savings to get home and stay at a motel until i’m on my feet again. Thankfully when I left my boss said I was always welcome back. My flight is in 2 days. Also probably shouldn’t have but I broke his phone too and said I accidentally spilled water on it because about an hour after I called the girl she texted him “Call me” and I panicked, I assume she plans to tell him that I know even tho I asked her not to. It hurts and i’ve been evaluating everything thus far, every conversation we’ve had, every little piece that hasn’t added up. One thing I will say, although he never begged me to move or anything, we did have numerous convos about the possibility and a month before I moved here he acted so excited and even sent me a bunch of job listings in the area. I definitely did not stalk him at all but he clearly wants his baby mama if he’s concocted this whole psycho fairytale to sell her so I’m honestly and truly done. Just trying to remain calm and sane until I’m up and out of his life for good. This whole time he hasn’t even asked why I’m not talking to him either, (thankfully ig because I wouldn’t know what to say) and I know he’s a garbage parasite but that just hurts me even more. It’s like I really was just nothing this whole time. Uprooted my whole life literally for nothing more than a singular month of playing wife. Now to pick up the pieces and repair em all on my own, while his life stays unchanged and he’s happy with his family. So yeah this was proabbly more of a vent but at least you guys can stop wondering. This has all happened within the last 48 hours so I am still collecting myself emotionally. I do appreciate all the support and advice. And to any women currently feeling like something isn’t adding up, please trust your gut the first time.

I (m23) have been with my girlfriend (22f) for 2 years. 2 weeks ago I tore my hamstring while deadlifting, the pain is severe and I have to use crutches to walk and even with the crutches it is still painful, according to the doctor the injury requires at least 4 months to heal, my girlfriend took care of me since I got injured.

Before the injury we had an active sex life, that has to be postponed because the pain and the medications killed my sex drive, and even if I had a sex drive it would still be difficult and painful. I thought my girlfriend would be patient and understanding but she wasn't, a few days ago she came up to me and told me how frustrating it is to abstain for that long and it is unfair to keep her waiting, that her libido is high and sex is a ""need"" for her. She then asked for a one-sided open relationship until I recover, her justification is that it is only physical and she won't form any 
emotional bond with anybody.

I was devastated when I heard that, just when I thought the pain couldn't get any worse, my partner of 2 years is watching me experience excruciating pain and instead of easing my pain she is adding to it, I rejected her idea and she was visibly frustrated, she tried to convince me again yesterday but I shut her down again.

1ksv3op,relationship_advice,I (32 f) tested positive for trich. Husband (37 m) says he didn’t cheat.,"Based on my understanding of trichomoniasis, it’s usually contracted via sexual contact. I know there was a study done somewhere where a group of girls got it from shared bath water. But, that isn’t the most common form of transmission by far. So unless my husband has been sharing bath water or wet towels with someone who has it, I really can’t think of how I would have caught it without him cheating on me. Does anyone have any possible explanation for how this could have happened? Or is he just full of shit and hoping I’ll believe him? 

I think the nurse at my doctor’s office just didn’t want to get in trouble somehow if she gave me a definitive answer about trich and cheating. She paused a lot and put me on hold a couple times so she could “look stuff up” and told me “it’s not always from cheating”. 🙄

1ieztco,relationship_advice,"Update after 7 years: My (then 29F) marriage to (then 29M) is getting annulled in a few days, not sure what to do/think.","Hey everyone,

This is a 7-year overdue update, but I wanted to share how things turned out, so many years later. About seven years ago, I posted about [my marriage getting annulled](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8dxbne/my_marriage_is_getting_annulled_in_a_few_days_not/). That post is likely gone now, so here’s a quick recap of the main issues:

1 - Children: I made it clear before marriage that I never wanted kids, ever. My ex agreed, but the moment we married, he pressured me relentlessly, every single day. He would put a stuffed toy under my shirt and say, isn’t it nice to be pregnant, or say it would be so cute to have a lil child clinging to my legs etc. He also suggested getting a dog which he later admitted was to  ""encourage my maternal instincts"" and then threatened to return her when I didn't change my mind.

2 - Other women: At a work event, a woman leaned on him, insisted on having dinner at our table, and later invited him to join her in her room’s jacuzzi (right in my face). He claimed she was ""crazy"" and that he didn’t know her, then changed his tune to he barely knew her, but I checked his messages and found out they had been having breakfasts and coffee together for a long time. There were more incidents like this, including him gaming just to meet a girl he had a crush on. Or asking out two girls he used to have a crush on out of spite (I asked him if I could meet a guy friend, he said no, then threw a fit that I even asked. I should have known better than to ask, apparently) and refusing to cancel until I had a meltdown. 

3 - No responsibility: He had cheated on all his exes and called them ""crazy."" When I finally lost it and screamed at him, he told me I scared him and refused to acknowledge his part in our problems. He wouldn’t stop seeing the coworker who started our issues, insisting it was ""important for networking."" They are not even in the same department. In marriage counseling, I told him I'd consider kids if he created a concrete 18-year plan for their care. He refused, saying, ""Just have the child, then we'll deal with it."" The counselor sided with me, but he stormed out and never went back.

4 - My emotional struggles: I behaved badly too - I had issues regulating my emotions, often screaming, crying, and once throwing books in frustration. I look back and cringe in  shame and embarrassment.

There were more problems, so many of them, but these were the biggest issues. I was lost, heartbroken, and overwhelmed. Reading the comments was hard, and I think I deleted the post eventually to avoid facing them. 

To the commentors:

To the redditors who were kind and rational in their comments, thank you. Most of you told me to leave and that the marriage was toxic. That was hard to hear at the time, but you were so right.

To the few who were rude: yes, wanting children is okay, but forcing someone who doesn’t, tricking them into marriage, isn't. And to the guy who implied my ex paid for everything, no, he didn’t. My parents helped me with my Master’s fees. We went halfsies on the house, everything. Also, the person who suggested I had bipolar disorder - diagnosing a stranger online is irresponsible. I’m now a psychologist, and no, I don’t have bipolar disorder (it’s a tough, lifelong condition. I really feel for those who have it). Emotional dysregulation happens for many other reasons.

Going through with the annulment:

The annulment only confirmed my decision. My ex gaslit me constantly, to the point where I had to keep an evidence list to remind myself of the truth. He falsely accused me of stealing money from our accounts, when all I did was take back wedding gift money from my family. Which he also did. He lied to a lawyer about my financial contributions, saying I paid only 60 dollars for the house, but I had bank records proving otherwise (I paid 70 000). His self-righteous lies were often so convincing that even I doubted myself at times. Referring to my evidence record sheet really helped!

Where I’m at:

I’m now in a healthy, loving marriage with a husband who makes me feel safe and cherished in ways I never imagined. We’ve been together 6+ years (yes we met very shortly after my annulment, so glad things worked out), and every day just keeps getting better. He’s kind, intelligent, funny, and thoughtful and, yes, handsome to boot. We have deep conversations about philosophy, sci-fi, and meaning of life, art, everything. He’s everything my ex wasn’t, and I see now how much happiness I would’ve missed if I had fought for that old marriage and stayed. Even if my ex had ""worked on things,"" he would never have been able to fulfill me the way my husband does.

Therapy (both self-guided and with other professionals) helped me grow tremendously. I’ve calmed down and learned to manage my emotions. The worst thing I do now when angry is raise my voice slightly or whine—no more screaming, no losing control, no helpless sobbing. Absolutely no name-calling. Turns out, a lot of my emotional struggles came from feeling unheard and trapped in a toxic marriage, with someone who was convinced he was god's gift to women. Being in a great marriage with a wonderful person really does wonders for emotional regulation and wellness!

I guess I just really wanted to say, if you’re in a bad relationship, please, PLEASE don’t stay out of fear. Being alone can be terrifying. But nothing is worse than being trapped in misery. For life.  

Looking back, I can’t believe I didn’t see how necessary it was to leave. People say Redditors love jumping to ""break up,"" but now that I’m in a wonderful, stable marriage, I get it. When you’re with the right person, everything feels different. You look at someone stuck in a bad situation and all you think is, why do people accept such treatment? Things could be so much better if they left. I then remind myself that I was once like that too, accepting the worst situations because leaving was too hard.

If you're in a bad relationship, please leave, it’s not worth it. Know that there *is* something better out there. Don’t let fear keep you from finding it. I’m proof of it, and honestly even if I had ended up single forever, I can tell you that I would prefer that. In the few months I was single, I realised how bad things were when I went to bed just being glad that there wasn’t a new argument or betrayal to discover. Do what is right for  you, not what is easy! 

Love you Redditors. Thanks for saving people from bad relationships all over the world. ",4483,0.98,4483,0,4576.0,93.0,52,1738389272.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ieztco/update_after_7_years_my_then_29f_marriage_to_then/,False,True

How do I get him to realize its not ok?,"I met my husband 12 years ago and have been married for 7 years. He's generally a sweet and kindhearted person and is usually fun to be around. We have a 6 year old daughter who's also terrific.

Lately, her favourite film is k pop demon hunters and absolutely loves singing the songs especially your idol and golden. She memorized all the lyrics. I know her constantly singing it can be a bit annoying but I used to drive my parents crazy singing songs from the lion king so I didnt mind too much. My husband however hated that film and I tried to encourage her to sing only when hes not around.

Yesterday though, once she sung golden, he flipped out and screamed at her and warned her not to sing anything from demon hunters anymore.

1iotdjd,relationship_advice,My(F26) husband(M35) of 10 years is amazing on paper…but I’m coming to terms with the fact I was taken advantage of.,"We have 2 kids together, F9 and M6. We’ve been together for 10 years but have been married for 7. I’m originally from a small town and ran away from home at the age of 15. I grew up in a really bad environment. My parents were drug addicts that were in and out of jail, and I was basically left to fend for myself since birth. I got to a bigger city, spent one year in and out of ppls homes, and then I met my husband shortly before I turned 16. 

When I met him, we barely talked for the first few months, but his girlfriend at the time offered me to be their roommate. They eventually broke up but he didn’t make me move out, and let me stay there for free when he realized I was dirt poor. I had a fucked up view of people being nice to me, and because he was so nice and he was a man, my teenage brain thought that it meant he wanted sex. So yes, it was me that came onto him, and I used this to excuse him engaging with me because I made the first move. But I was sixteen. He was 24. 

I ended up getting pregnant quickly with my daughter , and then we had our son a few years after. As our kids grow older, I’m trying to shield them from so many of my wrongs, and to do that effectively, I started going to therapy (in secret). It was only this past year that I realized my husband took advantage of me, and that he was the adult.  He’s an amazing father. He’s a great husband and provider. But I’ve had 2 breakdowns in the past 3 months because i’m so angry at him at the same time. I love my kids, but I shouldn’t have been thrown in that situation at such a young age. I don’t know what to do, please, advice on where to go from here?

1n20hx2,relationship_advice,My boyfriend (22M) ate all the jalapeño poppers I made before I (21F) even got one.,"Tonight, I (21F) cooked dinner for my boyfriend of almost 2 years (22M) and me. I made a main dish and some jalapeño poppers as an appetizer (8 total). I was really looking forward to them because I haven’t had them in a while.

We sat down to watch a movie, and I was still getting settled and hadn’t started eating yet. Over about 15 minutes, he ate all 8 of the poppers. When I went to grab one, the plate was completely empty. I didn’t get a single one.

I asked why he didn’t leave me any, and he said, “You didn’t say you wanted any.” I was kind of surprised because I made the whole meal for both of us, so I thought it was obvious they weren’t just for him. He said I’m overreacting because they’re “just snacks” and he was hungry.

I feel annoyed because 1) I took the time to make them and 2) it didn’t even occur to him to leave me one. But now I’m wondering if I’m blowing this out of proportion or if this is a sign he can be inconsiderate sometimes.

Isthis maybe a sign that he doesn’t consider my feelings sometimes?

UPDATE : 

We ended up talking about it that night, and I realized he honestly wasn’t trying to be rude. At first what he said sounded like him dismissing the fact that I was upset, but his reasoning actually made sense. I had made dinner for both of us, and the poppers were kind of an extra thing on the side. He thought they were just something I made for him because I know he loves them, and I did just kind of place them down on a small plate in front of him, so he didn’t think twice about finishing them off. I hadn’t said anything about them beforehand so he genuinely just didn’t think about it.

As soon as he realized how much it hurt my feelings, he felt so bad and definitely made up for it. That night he went to the store, bought everything to make more, and gave me a whole plate before he touched any. The next day he made another batch and made sure I got first pick.

For context, he’s a big guy, about 6’2 and built like a football player, so he can put away a lot of food. He wasn’t trying to be inconsiderate. He was distracted by the movie and honestly just really liked my cooking.

Everything is good now and he learned his lesson.😂

1n0xyi4,relationship_advice,My (38F) husband (44M) left to take care of his sick ex-wife (43F). Do I ask for divorce?,"My (38F) husband (44M) and I have been married for just over two years. Before our relationship, he was married to a woman named Lexi (43F). They met in their twenties and were together for nearly a decade, including seven years of marriage.

During their time together, Lexi was diagnosed with cancer. He supported her throughout the entire journey until she eventually recovered. Not long after her recovery, she expressed a desire to explore life independently, which ultimately led to their divorce.

Several months ago, Lexi reached out to him. The three of us had dinner together, and I found her to be warm, kind, and easy to talk to. Shortly after that evening, she asked to speak with him privately. During that conversation, she revealed that her cancer had returned. This time, the outlook was more serious, and she confided that she did not think she could go through treatment again on her own.

My husband told me everything, and I supported his decision to be there for her. I even offered to help, but Lexi gently declined, saying she did not feel comfortable being that vulnerable around someone she did not know well. I respected her honesty and stepped back.

As time went on, my husband became increasingly involved in her care and emotional well-being. At first, I tried not to question it. I understood how much she was going through and how much their shared history meant. However, as the weeks passed, it became clear that something had shifted. His presence in our shared life began to fade, and I could feel the distance growing.

Two weeks ago, he sat down with me to have an open conversation. He assured me that nothing romantic or inappropriate had happened between them, but he also admitted that the level of support Lexi needed was not something he could provide while also being a husband to someone else. He said he believed we should separate, at least for now, and that he would understand if I chose to move forward with a divorce.

He left our home shortly afterward, and we’ve had very limited contact since. I’m torn about what to do next. Part of me feels like I should ask for a divorce and start moving on, but another part wonders if I should wait and see how things develop.

1j5hhsa,relationship_advice,My coworker (18M) put me (22F) on a “hear me out cake” and posted it online. Do I take action in some way?,"I work at a diner as a waitress with this kid, let’s call him John. John has always seemed pretty chill and busses my tables. Sometimes we chat if we are closing together, usually about school, as he started college not too long ago and I am almost graduated with my BA. Ultimately, we are friendly but not friends. 

Last week he said that he was part of a group chat with a handful of other coworkers on instagram and asked if I wanted to join. I said sure because I haven’t connected with people at the diner that well and figured it was worth a shot. We swapped instas. The group chat is very normal, friendly banter between coworkers. 

Yesterday, I see that John posted a reel of him and a couple of his buddies doing their take on a “hear me out cake”, which is usually a very lighthearted and funny way of saying you would get with what are typically fictional and mostly animated characters. The entire cake adhered to that concept, except toward the end, when MY FACE (a picture that he must have screenshotted from one of my posts), is stuck on the cake. I was the only real person on that cake, and John actually made a comment about how attractive I was and that he wished that he could “hit that”, but doubts he has a chance. 

I feel insanely grossed out and kind of violated. I want the video taken down, but am not sure if I have the right or authority to do that. I ranted about this to my sister, and she told me to just take it as a compliment and be glad that someone thinks I am pretty. It feels wrong doing that. 

Is this grounds for taking this issue to higher ups? I don’t know if I am comfortable working with him at the moment. Do I just take care of this myself and tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and I want him to take it down? It is a public video. I am just uncertain how to move forward.

First off, I want to thank everyone for all of your helpful advice on my original post.

He did admit that the girl sent him a screenshot of the post and he was just upset because he didn't like a bunch of random people ""knowing his business"". But I also found out that he brought that same girl to our apartment when I was out of town a week prior and they had sex in our bed. Never apologized for it, but simply stated that if I came home when I said I was (I went to my mom's because we were in a fight and hadn't spoken in days and I decided to stay two days longer) then it wouldn't have happened.

We are absolutely over, and although he had begged me to forgive him for a couple days, he finally got mad enough at me because I wouldn't have sex with him that he left me alone. It's too expensive for me to break the lease, but we live in a two bedroom apartment so I am able to have my own space, or so I thought..

I woke up yesterday at three in the morning wondering where my dog was, as he sleeps with me. I get up and can't find him, but my ex's door is shut so I open it because I can hear my dog sniffing under the door to get out. There he is sitting on the bed with MY phone is his hand, going through it. After we had established that we were not together. I take it and look at the screen time information and he spent over 30 MINUTES in my saved passwords. So now  I am actually concerned and very weirded out and may just ask my mom for a loan to break the lease because he literally creeped in my room when I was sleeping and took my phone to go through it.

Anyway, thank you to everyone for the comments and concerns and advice. Although I feel like I wasted many years with him, it was a growing experience and I will absolutely do better in the future.

1mh3qqp,relationship_advice,"My (27M) fiancé and I (25F) just broke up, suddenly he can do chores and spend money on household supplies","As the title reads I just broke up with my fiancé, my partner of 7 years. One of the major problems in our relationship was that he didn’t contribute to the household. This being he didn’t help with chores often (in his words because he works so much) and he didn’t spend money on supplies for the house (new vacuum, toilet paper, trash bags). 

However after having broken up last week he has miraculously resolved these issues with himself. Now he washes all of his dishes, he bought himself a ton of bathroom items, a new vacuum just for him (ours is old and rickety but gets the job done). Now I get that he is buying these items because he is going to move out (possibly) and he doesn’t want to share items. 

It’s just very anger inducing because I’m wondering where all this effort and money came from. He couldn’t have helped me buy things and do chores before but now that we’re done he can..? My question is how do I not flip the hell out that he’s so selfish and manipulative?!


Edit/update: My profile has a previous post with more information for those interested in additional details. He is for sure moving out in September (at least that’s what he told me today). 

Thank you to everyone who has interacted with this post, I’m still hurting and healing. But I’m just going to remain optimistic on what the future holds without someone selfish being unappreciative of me.



Last update for awhile: 
he’s not able to move out in September as previously mentioned. He hasn’t gotten approved for the apartments he applied to. I don’t have the funds to move out so I’m just stuck until the start of December at least.  For those asking, we both work full time jobs. I was able to get a friend to agree to move in once he’s out. His job does pay significantly higher than mine however he does not pay more in bills because he screwed up his credit and bought a very expensive truck. I was also a student up until halfway through July when I graduated with my bachelors. Not bragging but I did receive honors as I was very dedicated - just to give you the perspective that I didn’t have a lot of free time either to be cleaning up after everyone.

She is a really sweet person, she has a nice personality but oh my god i cant ignore the brainrot anymore. This sounds like something made up for a youtube short with minecraft parkour in the background but i promise its real. 

Weve been dating for a few weeks and at first i just thought it was a little quirk of hers and that i would get over it. She sends those wolf ripping their shirt off memes to me and calls herself alpha (admitedly a little funny). The worst part is when im trying to be sexy or intimate or just compliment her at all in a way thats meant to be serious she says 'boomshakalacka' and says its because shes 'shy' and dosnt know what else to say. The worst time was when she responded to a shirtless pic of me with that and three blushing emojis, nothing else. She also constantly calls herself or me nonchalant and its getting too much. 

She also hates dogs, says its a green flag that she dosnt like them. Idk i adore dogs with my whole heart, i have a dog, i want more dogs. This seems silly but its a majour red flag to me. 

Bust basically i dont know how to tell her i dont want to see her romantically anymore over these things, they seem like such silly things and id feel like an ass if i just said it outright.

1lqzexw,relationship_advice,UPDATE: I (24f) want to break up with my magician boyfriend (27m) due to his inappropriate magic trick,"First off no, this story isn't AI or fake. It's sadly true but I can understand why people would think that its AI due to the absurdity of it. Secondly, thank you everyone for the advice in the comments of my previous post. I was lost and looking for some advice because of the uncomfortable situation and people around me felt differently about it than I did. People in the comments were right and I should trust my own feelings rather than searching for answers from the people around me. That's something that I've struggled with my whole life because my family is very reliant on each other and my parents are both helicopter parents. So I learned from young age that I couldn't trust my own instincts because other people know better. Which is why I asked my friends and mom about the situation. I have a lot more work to do in trusting myself but at least I'm working on it now. 

Here's the update:

After my previous post, I read through some of the comments and realized that what my boyfriend did would be considered assault. It wasn't something that I had even considered because I was only seeing it as him doing something stupid in the bedroom that broke my boundary and made me uncomfortable. But seeing those comments opened up my eyes a lot. If he was willing to break my boundary only after a year of dating and could do that to me in the bedroom than what else could he be capable of?

I met with him the next day at our apartment and I told him about my feelings which he didn't seem to care about. I showed him the reddit post so that he could see that other people were also uncomfortable with what happened. He read through your comments but when he saw the word 'assault' being used a few times he got really aggravated. I had never seen him that angry before but he was screaming nonstop and he even whipped my coffee mug across the room. I ended up crying because I was scared and I think that snapped him back to reality or something because he stopped yelling and was trying to comfort me. I made him leave our apartment again because I didnt want to be around him anymore. That night my friends helped me pack up my stuff and they took me to my parents house which is where I'm at now. 

After I was out of the apartment and safe, I called him and broke up with him over the phone because I didn't feel comfortable doing it in person after his previous reaction. I'm so upset that I wasted over a year of my life dating him and even thinking about a future with him. Thank you all for giving me the courage to follow my feelings and break up with him for good. I really appreciate it. Also, thank you for all the jokes its lightened the mood and has helped me feel a bit better about this situation.

Also, this isn’t even really “bad” necessarily, but still, it’s unfair to her to start saying this about her to other people who know us.

We have been dating for 6 years. It’s been great; we share values and beliefs in many things, and we genuinely enjoy spending time with each other. As we are getting closer to the serious stage of any relationship (marriage), I have started developing stronger concerns thinking about the future. I would say this has been on my mind for over a year, hoping and praying it would go away, but it just won’t, and if anything, it’s getting stronger. I just have a gut feeling I won’t be happy in the future. 

A lot of our relationship, I've dealt with basically everything, planning a 2-month trip in Europe and working on the day-to-day itinerary, and places to eat for date nights. Activities we can do: helping her get a job with building her resume and showing her how to apply, prepping her for job interviews, helping her with working on a healthy lunch for her work. It may sound controlling, but I genuinely don't want to do ""everything""; it's just the way our relationship is, and she likes it that way. I have tried multiple times to tell her that I would like her to help, but she always replies with ""I have no idea what I'm doing."" This, however, isn't even that bad, as I mentioned, I'm used to planning and doing everything for us; it's just become my role. However, as the years have gone by, I've always known her intelligence wasn't very ""high."" Pretty basic things are a struggle for her. She doesn't understand directions at all; her mathematics is really bad (struggles with 21+25). Even though we have been to Rome in Italy, she asked me if Rome is its own country. I was in disbelief the other day when she thought that the sun rises in the north and sets in the north every day. Seriously, how can somebody who has lived here for 25 years think thats true?

 I will tell her things that are important to me, and she will forget them, and I'll need to re-explain them a week later. I have tried to help her with things in our relationship. Once she came to me upset because at her workplace she needed to use fractions, and she didn't understand any of them; she was struggling with 3/4 and 1/4, for example. I sat down with her and offered to try to teach her and make her understand. She told me, ""I'll never need this again, so no need to learn."" Her emotional intelligence really lacks with the fights we have. Being completely honest and as harsh as it might sound, I think about when we have kids, she won't be able to really teach them anything, and if she does try, it will likely be incorrect. She gets upset that I correct her a lot because it makes her feel ""dumb."" I have tried to help her with simple tasks, but her unwillingness to learn is what is affecting me. I have spoken to her about this many times, but nothing is changing. I just don't know how to feel; she loves me a lot, and it would destroy her breaking up, but I just don't feel happy anymore.",4139,0.92,4139,0,4533.0,394.0,1076,1758658946.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nosakv/i_25m_cant_stand_the_incredibly_low_intelligence/,False,True

I thought the visit was good. The staff was polite, the doctor was helpful, and overall it felt just like the checkups we had when I was pregnant with our first child. Nothing felt unusual or off to me at all.

That same evening, my boyfriend randomly started a huge argument. It continued the next morning, and at the time, I had no idea what triggered it. Several hours later, he finally told me he thought the OB appointment was one of the most uncomfortable experiences of his life. He said the nurses were side-eyeing me, giving me weird looks, and that the energy in the room was off putting. He also said it was highly embarrassing for him.

When I told him I hadn’t noticed any of that and thought everything felt normal, he told me that I have a coping mechanism to avoid reality and that I never notice how people treat me. He has said things like this before. He has told me that people give me weird looks or judge him for being with me. I never see it, and it leaves me feeling confused, self-conscious, and emotionally worn down.

I’ve tried expressing how much it hurts when he says things like this and how it affects how I see myself. But it keeps coming up.

1kvnhjt,relationship_advice,40F grossed out over nearly everything my husband (40M) does. How do I get over it?,"I (40F), and my husband (40M) have been together since highschool. We have built a financially stable, and respectful relationship. He is a great father, and role model to our young children. He does equal share around the house (laundry, cooking, parenting, etc). 

Over the past 3-5 years, I’m continuously finding him less and less attractive. We’ve been to counselling together over this. And we’ve had many peaceful conversations but nothing seems to improve (from my perspective). 

I’m going to list a few examples (and before Reddit jumps on me saying these things are stupid, please understand we’ve been together for a long time, and all the little things eventually snowball into big things). 
He forgets about 70% of our conversations. I’m having to give him reminder receipts on everything we’ve talked about. He snores while awake- Literally. His face and hair smell so bad (to me, anyways. I’m pretty sure it’s just his bodily oils). When he wants attention, he gets really immature and starts talking in a baby voice. He leaves boogers, and skin flakes in/around the sink. I could go on with more examples, but let’s not keep you here forever. We have talked about every single one of these things, and more. If there could be a medical issue, he’s been to a doctor. Everything is fixable but it’s not being fixed. 

I know I’m not perfect. But these things seem to irritate me to my core. I feel like screaming at the top of my lungs, bashing my head through a wall. That’s dramatic but I feel desperate.  This cannot be the rest of my life. 

How do I get over this? Or what can we further do so we can live happily the rest of our lives?

How do I make him see the mistake he's making?,"\*Edit: Just to clarify a few things that keep coming up  - I do not live in the US and our kids are 24, 21 and 14. They all still live at home.

My husband (46M) and I (45F) have been together for 27 years, married for 22.

Three days ago he told me it's over and that he's been seeing someone else (F don't know age) for 6 months. He then packed a bag and left while I was laying on our bed, crying my eyes out, begging him to stay. I asked him for a hug and he pushed me off, saying it ""felt weird"".

I did not see this coming. There was no warning, no clues, just announced and walked. I have never been so fucking devastated in my entire life. This is somebody I have spent 60% of my life with. I love him more than life itself. We have three children and have been through so much together. Yes, there's been problems in the past, like any marriage, problems with money that has caused tension, disagreements over things, but this blindsided me.

I don't understand how he can replace 27 years with 6 months. It makes no sense. I would never do this to him. I am shattered and I can't find a way to make him see what a horrible mistake he is making. When I try and say things like that he tells me I'm being ""manipulative"". I've spent three days crying, like loudly crying, the sort of crying most people never experience. I can't sleep. It's consuming every second of my consciousness. I've told him we can work through this and that I am willing to take him back, in spite of what he's done, but he just isn't hearing it. He's said things like ""I will always love you in a way"" and we will ""always be linked by the children"". I have tried bringing this up, but it's been of no use.

When I first met him and he came along and offered security, I jumped on it! I knew it was weird dating a guy so much older, but I've always had a rebellion-ish mindset. I don't know, I thought it was kinda hot, I blame Lana Del Rey and people in my life for not telling me it was a questionable relationship.

We married when I was 25 and everything has been pretty alright on paper so I feel bad complaining.

We're both on the same page with a lot of things, live a pretty comfy life as DINKs and are building a solid foundation together. We show affection to each other, though sometimes it feels like he's just a roommate or a parental figure. Our sex life is boring and that's also a big part of it. I know if I divorced him, we'd both be back to where we started financially and I couldn't really afford to live where/ how I do. I also don't want to go through the hassle of dating again?

Anyways, even though I'd say our marriage is like, 80% good and I feel a deep love for him, I also realize now that my frontal lobe is fully developed I'm growing out of this container of him making all the desicions. I probably wouldn't chose him as a partner if I had met him now. 

Really the core of it all is that I'm carrying this resentful/ ick feeling that he pursued me when I was so young. So what if I was mature for my age? I couldn't even imagine dating a 22 year old now and I'm only 27.

Has anybody else been in this situation? How did you work through it?

EDIT: I received a lot of interesting perspectives, so thank you to everyone who commented. I didn't realize this would get so much traction, but that's what everyone says 😅. 

Honestly I was just in my late night feelings and wanted to get it off my chest, see if anyone else has successfully worked through not only a change in personalities with their partner, but generational gaps tied into that. 

I thought about deleting this but I think it might help others think through things in their relationships so I'll leave it up.
To clarify some things: he wasn't well off when we got married we just built a stable life together. He's changed a lot also, and in a way we influenced each other into the people we are now or maybe we just both had space to let go of past traumas and then accidentally became different people in that process.

 And the ick from the age gap didn't come from social media, it came from me growing up and seeing relationship dynamics more clearly. Lastly, I will talk to him about all this. Its not like we haven't deeply and repeatedly talked about issues before, I just never brought up the age difference because I felt like it was my choice to marry him and in the beginning I told him a million times I was alright with it.

1ntmjfw,relationship_advice,(UPDATE) My (28F) boyfriend (29M) let my stalker ex (28M) into our apartment to leave me a birthday surprise. How do I handle this absurdity?,"Hello all, my last post blew up a bit and many people were concerned about me so I'm going to give you this update. I can't even put into words how insane this situation has gotten. Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/lgwJGmWYJ4).

TL;DR my boyfriend Cole has been allowing my stalker ex to send me gifts like it's no big deal, and even let my ex into my apartment to decorate for my birthday.

When I got back home on Friday, I tried to come up with a good plan to keep myself safe while I confronted Cole in case he were to do something scary (a lot of people put the fear of god into me in the comments of my last post). I invited my very tall and intimidating younger brother over to be there while I talked to Cole. My brother couldn't come over until Sunday, so I spent a day and a half awkwardly trying to pretend everything was fine, but I must have done a shit job because Cole kept asking me what was wrong and love bombing me.

Eventually Sunday came around, my brother showed up and I/we grilled Cole about why the hell he's been so fine with my ex coming around with gifts and even letting him in to decorate our apartment for my birthday. I was NOT ready.

All of you had a lot of theories, one of which came up a lot was that the two knew each other and/or were working together to do this. If anything I would have RATHER that been the case because the truth is so much more fucked up.

Basically, Cole has been FIXATED on my ex. He has essentially been stalking my stalker. Cole admitted that he made fake social media accounts (Yes. Multiple.) to follow my ex, and has been stalking his Instagram and Facebook. Apparently, my ex has been making a lot of vent posts about me and how hurt he is that I'm not returning his feelings and have moved on so fast and Cole has been egging him on on his alt accounts to get my ex to keep trying. The reason my ex is still stalking me is because Cole has been literally telling him to on his fucking alt accounts. It's obvious my ex is unstable if he's listening to random strangers telling to ""keep trying"" and Cole is taking advantage of his instability by planting thoughts into his head. If I am to believe Cole's words, my ex has no idea that it's Cole that's been encouraging him to keep pursuing me but I can't be certain about anything this guy says at this point.

So why, you ask, was Cole doing all of this? That is exactly what my brother and I asked. This was his answer; to give my ex false hope. Basically to bully(?) him. Any time my ex angst-posted on his social media about me, Cole got some sick satisfaction out of watching his misery. He wanted to string my ex along to keep trying to win my heart just to watch him fail over and over. Cole finds it hilarious that my ex is wasting so much money on gifts for me and that it's HIM who eats the chocolates and reads the desperate love letters my ex sends to me while I act like my ex's gifts are radioactive and avoid them. This has all been some sick game to see how long he can get my ex to keep pining for me. Who the hell even DOES THIS? I've been living in fear for months because Cole thinks it's funny to manipulate my ex and watch him be ""heartbroken""? I cannot articulate how sick all of this is. How is this funny? What is wrong with him? He said he ""makes sure not to go too far"" by discouraging my ex to make direct contact with me but I can't believe anything anymore. I've read so many stories of people who were dating someone who seemed so sweet initially but turned out to be actually unhinged, but I naively never thought that could be me. I was so careless and dumb because I clung to someone who finally treated me with kindness but he is a twisted man who turned my ex into a monster by feeding his delusions. I think if he hadn't done all this, my ex probably wouldn't still be stalking me in the first place!! My constant fear and discomfort have just been an ""unfortunate byproduct"" of his little game of puppetry. I can't even comprehend how someone could do something like this. I'm so shaken up I feel like I'm spiraling. 

Suffice to say I'm living with my brother and his gf while my ex gets the hell out. I told him he needs to move out within the week or I'm getting the cops involved. He didn't make a fuss or anything, surprisingly. He just looked at the floor like a kicked puppy. He hasn't even tried to call or text me but I blocked him just in case. I'm going to see if my landlord can understand my situation and let me break lease early with no extra cost, but if I can't, my brother is going to cover the extra cost in the meantime, and I'll stay with him and his gf until I can find somewhere else. My brother is seriously a godsend.

I'm DEFINITELY going to go back to therapy as soon as possible because this whole situation has me unable to sleep at night, trust anyone and I really need a better understanding of what are red flags in relationships. So many of you told me I was a pushover and you're all right. It shouldn't have taken this long for me to call this relationship with Cole off. This is so fucked up, but I'm safe for now. I don't know what I'd do without my brother and his gf. Thanks to everyone who told me to get out of this relationship because Cole was way more twisted than I ever could have thought. I don't even know if he told the whole truth, but I don't even care anymore. I'm out. Gone. Never looking back.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice and words of encouragement! I called the non-emergency police line to file a report of all this. It wasn't super helpful other than just making a record so I'll do a follow-up with them once I have safe access to my apartment and can collect evidence. I unblocked Cole for now to gather any text evidence as some of you suggested but he's been pretty quiet. He sent a photo of a couple of garbage bags full of his stuff and he asked if he could have a day to say goodbye to my cat (I have her with me currently at my brother's place, no way am I letting her near him). I haven't replied yet. I turned read receipts off. Haven't contacted ex 1 yet (still figuring out the best way to do that). Tomorrow is a stat holiday where I live so my brother and his gf will be home from work. We are working together to figure all this out. Definitely moving out of my current place as soon as I can. Sorry I can't reply to all the comments, I'm still pretty overwhelmed and anxious and there are so many that it's frying my brain but I'm trying to read most of them. I appreciate every one of you, though!",3997,0.99,3997,0,4038.0,41.0,256,1759163005.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ntmjfw/update_my_28f_boyfriend_29m_let_my_stalker_ex_28m/,False,True
1hm509y,relationship_advice,My fiancé (26M) kicked me (23F) four times in the chest. Why…?,"We've been together for 6 years, and we were planning to get married in 2025. For years, I did feel that he actually loved me. But few nights ago, he got angry at me but it wasn't the angriest he had ever been, I was trying to push him off while he was playing his games and I don't know what but something flipped and he kicked me hard in the chest four times even after I fell down to the floor. He never once asked me if I was okay that night. I know that it is not right to do that to someone else but why do people do that to someone they love? Like is putting your hands on your partner ever justifiable? I'm possibly still in denial, but what am I supposed to do now? I always heard about stories like these where their partners put their hands on them but I never once thought it would happen to me.. i know I should leave and I want to but it’s easier said than done.. I feel helpless because I don't have anyone to talk to about it.

UPDATE!!!! 

Never would I ever imagine that the internet would be so kind to me. I wish I could reply back to everyone, but do know that I’ve read every single of it. You have no idea how much your words mean to me, to have complete strangers to care for my safety in such a genuine way. I’ve moved out and blocked him everywhere but he managed to apologise to me via email. He finally acknowledged what he did to me was wrong but not without placing half the blame on me. He mentioned that he snapped because of those times I’ve tried to leave him. I can’t lie that when I was reading the email, I almost fell for it but then I remembered the words from the thousands of strangers on Reddit, you gave me strength. 

As I’m typing this update, I’m at the hospital waiting for a scan. 

To clarify on why “I pushed him off”: he was playing video games and wanted BJ but I was not in the mood for it so I pushed him off (lightly, he was not physically hurt). If the roles were reversed, I would’ve never physically hurt someone even if they’re weaker than me. 

I am aware of the consequences of staying in an abusive relationship but when these fears become a reality, it takes awhile to fully accept it because I never once imagined it would happen to me. I knew him for 6 years but I guess I never really did.

I’m so sorry to those who read this and have to be reminded of how it felt for them and to those who are currently experiencing similar situations like me, please get out &lt;3",3951,0.93,3951,0,4273.0,322.0,1681,1735148038.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hm509y/my_fiancé_26m_kicked_me_23f_four_times_in_the/,False,True
1jgfopm,relationship_advice,"Wife (F27) cheated on me (M30) early in the relationship, now she’s flaunting it","UPDATE: I have been no contact for weeks. Last night, I just got a bunch of missed calls and 53 messages about how much she hates me. Her trip ended 3 days ago. That was a fast turn up. I’m thinking about sending one message, but open to advice.  

Wife cheated on me at the beginning of our relationship (5 years ago). I forgave her but asked if she could remove him from her social group out of respect. She fought it, but eventually agreed.

Back in last December, she added him again. Only said, “I’m sorry this makes you feel bad.” Then she went back to her hometown for a couple of days and went AWOL—spent some nights out of my in-laws’ house and gave me some elaborated excuses. I didn’t buy it, so I confronted her. She ended the relationship over text.

She came back home after a couple of days and said she was going to move out. Took her 2 months to actually do it. I ended up helping her move out, and then I moved out myself since I didn’t want to be in our old apartment alone.

We haven’t filed for divorce yet but have been living separately for 3 weeks.

Today she posted on social media a picture showing she’s traveling abroad with the guy she cheated on me with. Clearly wanting me to see it.

I feel like it’s total disrespect. Needless to say, I gave her the stars and the moon over 5 years of marriage. So I can’t understand this move of hers.

Please, I could use some help or perspective here.

My reaction here is: no reaction at all. You think that is ok? ",3940,0.96,3940,0,4111.0,171.0,545,1742560240.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jgfopm/wife_f27_cheated_on_me_m30_early_in_the/,False,True
1k8bsbw,relationship_advice,My (29F) couples therapist made comments during my individual session that were so concerning I no longer feel emotionally safe continuing therapy with my girlfriend (24F).,"My girlfriend (24F) and I (29F) deeply love each other, and we started couples therapy to work through some differences. I’m hyperactive, tend to be nomadic, and love trying new things. My girlfriend, on the other hand, prefers to stay home and socialize less. These differences have caused some friction, which is why we sought therapy.

The first joint session went well. Then we each had individual sessions with the therapist.

During my solo session, the therapist told me my partner said I take her for granted and never prioritize her. I tried to explain my side — that I do make a lot of efforts: I regularly visit her family, I plan thoughtful gestures, and sometimes I feel a lot of pressure to be enough. I shared that I sometimes feel like nothing I do is ever quite enough.

The therapist didn’t acknowledge any of that. She told me:

1) I dominate the relationship (what we eat, what we do, who we see) — which is simply not true. We make decisions together, and I always try to listen to my partner’s needs and preferences.

2) i’m unwilling to make sacrifices,

3) I don’t recognize my partner’s efforts,

4) And that I make things “my way or the highway.”

She framed me as rigid, selfish, and controlling. At the end of the session, I broke down in tears and couldn’t even speak — I just paid and left. She never once validated anything I said.

Later, I found out that during my partner’s session, the therapist asked her several times if she was sure she didn’t want to leave me. She also reportedly described me as manipulative and selfish, and interpreted a moment where I gently placed my hand on my partner’s thigh (during our first joint session) as an attempt to silence her — when in fact, I was trying to comfort her.

Even my partner said she felt uncomfortable with how intense and biased the therapist was toward me. She was really hurt that the therapist twisted her words, especially about me not prioritizing her. It felt like her feelings were misrepresented, and it caused her a lot of distress as well. So it’s not that the therapist ""sided"" with her — it’s more that she seemed to frame me in a really negative way without space for nuance or understanding.

I’m open to self-reflection. I know I can be rigid sometimes and want to work on that. But the therapist’s approach felt harsh, shaming, and not constructive. It triggered old wounds and made me feel small and unworthy of love.

I haven’t found any other couples therapists in my area, so I feel stuck. I don’t know whether to give this another chance or to walk away.

Has anyone been through something similar? How do you tell the difference between helpful confrontation and emotional harm?",3912,0.96,3912,0,4082.0,170.0,555,1745670429.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k8bsbw/my_29f_couples_therapist_made_comments_during_my/,False,True
1hpds3g,relationship_advice,"How do I tell my wife (37F), who has BPD, that she is losing me (37M) and our 9 and 11 year old?","The basic backstory is my wife has BPD,, anxiety and depression. Over the last 3 to 4 years she's gotten progressively worse. She's at the point where she can hardly hold a job, doesn't help with any household tasks, doesn't interact with our kids, and has no interests except smoking weed and chatting with dudes on snap because ""it makes her feel better""

Big kicker, last July, she offered my minor neice weed AND sent her a link to a NSFW kink test. CPS obviously got involved, police, etc. I was cleared instantly, she admitted to everything had zero repercussions. It's like it gave her free reign to do whatever she wants. 

I held my daughter Monday night while she cried to me about how she wished her mom cared about her as much as her mom cares about her friends. My son straight up said he'd rather spend his holiday break with his grandparents if she's just going to sleep and not hang out with him. They're hurting, we all are.

When CPS came around, she took off, said she was moving back to west coast US. Her brother convinced her to turn around and come back here. I'd file for divorce, but I know she's sick, she goes to therapy (finally). I have a lawyer on retainer and papers have been ready since August to serve.

So twofold. How do I approach her with all of this. She needs an ultimatum at minimum, but she'll just shut down. I've read the books and talked with therapists and everything we've tried to do to get a conversation going fails. It's beyond time she hears how badly her kids and I are hurting. 

Or do I skip that and just file? CPS already failed them once, even the police were amazed she was cleared after admitting everything, and since she was cleared all they could do was a counter ticket for the weed. I cannot get sole custody as a male in my state, my lawyer has said as much. I can just imagine the hell they'd have, even limited time with her. 

It's all screwed up. Anyone else ever been in something like this? Or have anything? I'm at wits end. 

EDIT for readability and clarity

..................

Update : Went to talk with her when she got home. I didn't just come attack her with accusations, but chatted for a few minutes. Then asked if we could have a conversation about the kiddos, and some things they'd told me about how they're feeling. I said one thing: ""They said theyre confused about what's going on, and don't feel loved like they used to."" She shut down instantly. Sat in silence for a few minutes, told her I'd really like to talk because im worried about them and got hit with ""you're just mr perfect. I might as well just go back home. None of you need me, obviously. Just leave me alone.""

1izeitu,relationship_advice,My 33M wife 30F is upset about the fact that I picked her and our daughter over my mother in a medical emergency. I think she's being ridiculous but she's acting like I betrayed her. Help?,"My brother-in-law directed me here since y'all give advice apparently. Appreciate y'all in advance.

My wife and I have had the hypothetical who would you pick conversations in all three of her pregnancies, but I never thought it'd be a real-life choice until two days ago when my wife went into labor with our daughter and my mother fainted and hit her head badly at my sister's house.

We were already on our way to the hospital after dropping off our boys at my mother in law's house when my sister called and told me that my mother fainted, and it was bad. I then told my sister that my wife was in labor. My wife has asked me why I was suddenly shaken but I brushed it off not wanting to stress her.

Luckily, all went well with her labor and our daughter was born heathy. Once everyone was settled, I told my wife what had happened and that mom was relatively okay, turns out the blood made it look worse than it was, and I told her that I was going to visit her and bring her back food.

When I came back my wife asked about my mother, and I updated her and then she said that I really did pick her. I told that of course I did. My mother had my sister and brother and besides that, she needed me, and I wasn't missing the birth of our daughter. Apparently, that was the wrong thing to say since she looked at me weird and asked what our daughter had to do with it and I got confused but told her that I wasn't missing our daughter's first breaths or her being born, just like I didn't miss those things with our 2 boys. Then she got this sad look on her face and said that I didn't really pick her then, I picked our daughter, and she came with proxy. I told her that it's not the case, I picked both of them, especially since we wouldn't have any of our kids without her, but she's been sad, crying often and looks at me like I betrayed her.

I get that her body is going through some massive changes I wouldn't even begin to understand but she was never this emotional or sensitive after our boys' births. Is it hormones? Is it because it's a girl and our last? Is it because she's a girl and she feels that I'll care for our daughter more than her? I'm honestly lost.

Help, please?

Edit: Thank you all for showing me exactly where I fucked up and for some of you rightfully reaming me out. 

Just to clarify, I do not see my wife as an incubator or only as the mother of our children although I understand now where I came off that way. 

I took someone's advice in the comments and got up this morning and went to get her favorite flowers, her favorite cupcakes and the jewelry she'd been eyeing that I had bought originally for our anniversary but decided to give it now instead. I apologized and told her how much she means to me, that she's my whole world.

Obviously, it's not a magical fix but she was happy and didn't look at me with tears in her eyes, so I'll take the win. We'll talk more about it once she's ready. I didn't bring up PPD with her yet as I realize that this is my fault and not necessarily an indication, but I'll be careful about signs and will bring it up if I see even one as will she since she takes her mental health seriously.",3902,0.96,3902,0,4072.0,170.0,400,1740659049.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izeitu/my_33m_wife_30f_is_upset_about_the_fact_that_i/,False,True
1id1vsr,relationship_advice,My husband (36M) just gave me (34F) an ultimatum: quit my side hustle teaching yoga or he’s leaving our marriage,"buckle up, here we go. long-winded - enter at your own risk

I got married a year and a half ago to the most incredible person. I’d just gotten out of a six year relationship, we were friends for a few months, and it quickly became every bit of the classic ‘when you know, you know’ for both of us. Within three months we’d bought our first home, got engaged after nine months, and then got married almost a year to the day (from our engagement) with a dream destination wedding in Greece. We’ve been together now 3+ years. It’s important to know we are in multicultural marriage; my husband is Hindu Punjabi (emigrated from India over a decade ago) and I’m a white American - Greece was equidistant travel for both of our families, who get along famously and have really embraced our blending of cultures. We have a lot of family support on both sides. When we got married we were on the same page about what we expected from each other and what we wanted. Our red lines were physical violence and cheating - we agreed everything else was figure-out-able. One of those things we agreed on was fitness - in early in our relationship, we worked out together constantly, went on runs, etc. and we talked often about our mutual desire to continue to cultivate a long, healthy life together. 

A few differences to note: he grew up in a household with very traditional gender roles in India - his father was verbally abusive to his mother (would go days giving her the silent treatment), my husband has been open about how witnessing this affected him growing up. His parents have worked it out over time but his mom has shared openly about this dynamic with me. His father rarely has to lift a finger at home but worked very hard to provide for the family - very traditional Indian culture. My husband has two sisters who both take a more modern approach to their relationships and that seems to be accepted within the family. My parents split responsibilities 50/50 as often as possible, both worked full-time, they’ve always been best friends, and I rarely saw them argue. My husband is easily triggered and very reactionary - works on it in his own way but refuses to try individual therapy. 

Shortly after we got together, we moved to a new state for his job about an hour north of the city where we met/had lots of friends. He worked a mid-shift at the time and wasn’t getting home until 1-3 am the first year of living in our new state, the hour drive made it harder to see friends regularly and I was home alone all the time. Integrative nutrition and movement gave me my life back a few years ago after being diagnosed with a chronic illness, so after about a year of living in our new state, I found a local fitness studio to start taking classes to tone up for our wedding and meet some friends. My husband has had on/off issues with marijuana - very all or nothing kind of person, no balance when weed is in the house, so that started to creep back in just before we got married. It’s a daily fight for him and I’m here to help him through it - every few months, he relapses, goes on a bender and then realizes it sends him into a deeper depression. 

Being loved by a supportive partner gave me another level of confidence. I felt like I could pursue just about anything and we’d somehow make it happen. I’d been a fitness instructor in college and had always wanted to pick it back up, so with his late night schedule, I signed up for a yoga teacher training program and started the weekend we returned from our wedding. It was every other weekend intensives and a big time commitment but I made a point to try my best to nurture our free time together. I ended up loving teaching yoga, made lifelong friends, and was the first of my cohort to be offered a job right after training at the studio. Teaching at this studio is highly competitive, usually you have to do a mentorship but they let me get right on the schedule - I was thrilled.

My husband started experiencing pretty significant job stress around this time (and honestly, a really awful boss situation - we’ve all been there) and started showing symptoms of high functioning depression; in bed for both weekend days doom scrolling and watching football, withdrawn from activities that used to make him happy, no desire to spend time with friends and limited energy to spend time with me. His parents, my parents, and some of our friends noticed the change. Instead of a partnership, he started expressing his desire for me to act more like a stay at home wife - dinner on the table every night, house tidy as my main responsibility (I also work a 9-5 remote from home and am the breadwinner, so it was hard to have this expectation morph from a shared responsibility to solely mine).

All of this was building until we found out I had an aggressive form of pre-cancer and had to see a specialist for treatment in another state (8 hour round trips every weekend for months). The whole thing seemed to give him purpose again and confronted with my potential early mortality, we spent our car rides talking about our dreams and life goals. We dreamed up an idea to start a matcha and cold-pressed juice camper to have a little side business together on the weekends and started moving forward with that but as soon as I got the all-clear last June, he fell right back into a depressive episode. I tried to plan small activities without putting too much on his plate (work stress was still at an all-time high) but after awhile, he started to resent me for keeping him away from being in bed. I continued with our business plans alone, kept teaching yoga, working my 9-5 and holding it down for him at home but no amount of me would help pull him out of the work-bed-depression cycle. In his darker moments, he expressed that he felt like my job teaching yoga was taking away from my ability to be there for him. When I ask for specifics, he likes to tell me I ‘should know’ and that no matter what I did, I was somehow falling short. At this point, I’d fallen in love with teaching yoga. My classes started waitlisting; helping my students gave me passion and purpose and I’d finally found real community, which was such a bright spot when there was no effort being put into our partnership at home. Our fights began to escalate and I found myself on the receiving end of low-blows, name calling and verbal abuse. I tried so hard to meet him where he was and stay neutral/non-reactive but you can only be called a bitch so many times without losing it on occasion. 

This past November, he was promoted and finally had normal work hours. I switched my workout schedule at the studio to mornings so that I could be there for him when he got home at night (with the exception of one night a week). When I got offered a second class/weekend spot on the yoga schedule (because my first class was doing so well), I wanted to accept it immediately but made a point to ask him first - he said he was ok with it but hated the idea. Over the past year of teaching, it’s been hard seeing instructor friends’ husbands show up for them - something about this gig my husband just hates and I wish he could just be supportive and proud but any time I spend at the yoga studio (max 3 hours weekly) he’s expressed it takes away from him somehow. 

A girlfriend (who he knows well and I thought, likes as a human) from the yoga studio came over Monday night to do a little bit of work on a series we’re doing together - I cooked dinner for us all, made sure my husband had what he needed and after my friend left, I got in bed and gave him a hug only to be met by ‘get the fuck away from me’ followed by 48 hours of the silent treatment, despite my pleading to try to have a conversation. Last night, he came to me and said - ‘it’s yoga or it’s me. You have until Sunday to quit your teaching job or I’m leaving our marriage’ and I’m just gutted. I’ve tried to offer a compromise and even offered to take a short leave of absence from teaching but he refuses to speak to me until I ‘make my decision’ on Sunday and apparently, it’s all or nothing. 

Movement has saved my mental health. I’ve found so much purpose through teaching - having a student approach me to tell me they sleep better on nights they’d taken one of my classes or they feel more relaxed or inspired in any way just absolutely lights me up. I finally feel seen standing up there and I’ve somehow gotten good at it. I love being of service to other people. 

Yoga has transformed my mental health so much that I stepped away from therapy in 2023, but out of desperation I reached out to my former psychologist for an emergency session this morning who told me to hold the line and not quit just because he’s threatening to leave. Hearing her say ‘the hardest thing you will ever do is say no and then watch what he does next’ has ripped me to my core. I still love this man and desperately want to make it work (even though I know if I were to hear this story from a friend or stranger, they’d tell me to run). I finally told my parents what’s been going on, they’re supportive. I quietly reached out to his sister who reassured me that we are family and they’d knock some sense into him, but am I missing something here? The ultimatum seems like its about something so much deeper than my yoga job but it’s ripping me apart that the person I love wants me to quit something I’ve become so passionate about. Not sure what my next move is, but I’d love to hear any takes from fellow internet stranger-friends.

EDIT: I have asked him to seek individual and marriage counseling. The ultimatum he gave is totally rooted in an attempt to control me - my current plan is to give him options (one of those options being therapy or mediation of some kind) ",3898,0.94,3898,0,4164.0,266.0,1470,1738177995.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1id1vsr/my_husband_36m_just_gave_me_34f_an_ultimatum_quit/,False,True
1ldoowq,relationship_advice,"*UPDATE* Finally meeting my (29m) online ""girlfriend"" (29f) after years of talking, it's not going well.","Context

A couple months ago I made a post about our first time meeting, it gained a lot of traction. Can read them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jnfcc9/finally_meeting_my_29m_online_girlfriend_29f/) The tl;dr is we had been talking for years and then things got more serious. We both share the same interests so the relationship was very important to me, as it's something I value a lot. We had a fantastic time as a LDR but the first time meeting was rough. The first couple of days were so bad it prompted me to make the post. She has severe anxiety and was the root for most of the issues. However the last day was much better and things were on the up and up. We planned another trip to a city closer to me in the states, where there would be an event we were both excited about.

The last 2 months

Things seemed to be going really well post first trip. She opened up a bit more about the meetup and was very apologetic about the whole thing. We spent the next couple of weeks in calls and video chatting, doing what we love together. Things were great, but something was missing. A piece of the relationship, something intimate and playful, seemed to have faded.

This was her call. She decided that she should be less flirty and sexual online, until she can express that the same in person. I respected that. I believed it just needed time, and I’ve always been committed to working through things together. Unfortunately that's where things started to spiral. One thing about her is that she’s very independent, and that often came across as distant, uncaring. There's some days where she chooses to not interact with me, ignore my messages, or get short when I try to be affectionate and caring. Usually this only happens when she's having a rough day (understandable).

Unfortunately a week ago she was having one of those terrible weeks. In my head a relationship should be one of comfort, relief, but while I tried to help her through it she lashed out and started being distant. I tried to comfort her but it was met with a coldness I couldn't understand. I had to guess how she was feeling and was left in the dark a lot. I made the, in hindsight wrong choice of opening up about how I didn't understand and how I just wanted to be someone she could lean on. About how it made me feel awful I couldn't support her. I felt shut out so often.

This turned into a lot of messages about how we felt about relationships in general, and the changes ours would need to take. It focused on how we care about eachother a lot, but she has her anxiety and independent healing she has to work on, and how I have to give her more space, and ""care less"". The main villain, as was the culprit of the first meeting, was her anxiety. It's ruining her life in more ways than just our relationship. She's struggling everywhere. So her #1 priority was to get in a better spot with that, then work on us. This was a great compromise, and I was excited for the next step in the relationship. I would continue to give her time and space, to wait for someone I think is a one of a kind worth it, and she would get to the place where she believes that too about herself.

And finally, now.

I boarded the plane with a lot of hope. Things were good after a few days of us getting back on track. But as I landed, I got a short, heartbreaking message from her. She said she's not in a healthy enough spot to make this relationship work for either of us. That after some reflection, her problems are so bad that she needs to step away and work on them. She doesn't think she'd be able to handle the trip we'd planned, and would be ruining another critical point in our relationship. 

The part that hurts the most isnt the time I've given her, the financial, emotional, or physical pain. Or the fact this came out of the blue at the worst time. What hurts the most is it feels like she went from telling me how I was going to be her future, to her basically treating me like an acquaintance. The last few days have been so tough. We talked for a little while that first day, her entire focus of the conversation was that she needed to get better. She barely once talked about us, I got no closure. And now trying to talk to her feels like talking to someone I barely know. Despite her saying she wants us to stay close.

One of the first things she told me when we started talking was how words meant everything to her, they're so important, they should always mean something. She kept saying how much she cared about us, yet her current actions make me feel the complete opposite. I see her online, hanging out with friends, posting online, like I never existed, like I was just a footnote in her life.

I'm here now, I'm going to try to make the best of the trip. But being alone again hurts so much. I don't understand. Somedays the distance felt like nothing, and other days she made the miles so much longer... I really tried so hard, I'm exhausted. I'm getting older, feeling the pressure of finding my person really setting in. I don't want to settle, but I feel like I'm going to have to.

I want more than anything to just make things right with her, to go back to that week and just give her the space she wanted, so we'd be on this trip together right now. I mentioned above that she's very independent, and her anxiety is taking that away from her. She can't do the things she wants with the people she wants, and I understand that. But what about us? 

I'm devastated. I know a lot of you saw this coming, and the rest of you all wanted to see this work.

How do I move on? I know theres probably no saving this but I wish there was, what can I do? And how do I find anyone like her again?

tl;dr

Planned another meetup with my LDR girlfriend. The first one was rough but this one felt like it was going to be great. We had a rough week and talked a lot about our relationship. However the day I traveled in, she broke up with me, citing her anxiety as the culprit. I'm not sure what to do now.

Important edit here;

I've tried local for a few years, I've never had trouble getting dates or matches on apps locally. But I live in a small, rural town, and haven't found anyone that aligns with my values and interests. From my experience over years of doing this is that dating locally, will be settling. Which is why I tried online. There's a bigger city about an hour and half / 2 hours away. Maybe I'll look there, but the relationship will still be long distance.",3891,0.94,3891,0,4156.0,265.0,649,1750170757.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ldoowq/update_finally_meeting_my_29m_online_girlfriend/,False,True
1ka3heu,relationship_advice,How do I (42f) tell my husband (42m) of 15 years I want a divorce now that he's less of an AH?,"My husband (42M) and I (42F) have been married for 15 years, and together for 20 years (as of this month). Tbh, we've both sucked at various points in our marriage. The first year was great. Years 2-6 were rough after we moved for my job and he became unemployed and had years of on-and-off work. He was lazy and entitled and I was mean and emotionally volatile. We fought a lot. We both handled it poorly in our early 20s. Things stabilized when he found a good job and matured a bit.

Still, he's always been a bit entitled. Financially, I make more. I do 80% of the housework. (He does his laundry. I do mine, plus sheets, towels, anything joint. He thinks he takes out the trash because he takes out the kitchen garbage, and thinks I'm unreasonable for asking him to empty the bathroom because I'm the one ""who uses that garbage can."") I spent years planning vacations, doing all of Christmas. (I'm a different religion. But i love our nieces and nephews and his parents.) It's really most of the work. He does mow the lawn and snowblow. I help shovel snow and that's it outside. I do maintain my own car. I believe he thinks his big contributions to our relationship are tracking and managing Netflix and other shows, driving, and being fun. I'm not kidding. Some of this happened because I was too particular and controlling, and I have a higher standard than he does, which sometimes is bad on me, sometimes bad on him. I'm controlling, he's incompetent. Bad combo. 

Probably around 2019, he started becoming rude to me. It started small but i addressed it regularly. The most annoying part was when he blamed me for everything. The tiny example is when he couldn't find the TV remote. ""Where did you put the remote?"" The rudeness increased after his best friend died by suicide. I gave a lot of leeway and stopped pushing back on his rudeness. I told him multiple times he needed to go to therapy. After a lot of excuses, he admitted he didn't want therapy because he didn't want to do the work. I stopped asking.

In 2022, I got sick. I was scared it was cancer, but all the tests came back clean. The 9th doctor i tried helped me clean up my diet, get active, start meditation, and motivated change. I'm not cured or diagnosed, but I'm much better. But it's a daily practice to work on my health. I'm now training for a 5k, I've stopped watching TV, and i read. During that process, I moved into the guest bedroom to get better sleep. (He refused to treat his apnea and blamed me for not giving him a sleep clinic number.) I stopped hanging out with him because I wasn't watching TV anymore. He said no when I asked him to go for a walk. Always an excuse. I ended up creating a separate life in our home. Eventually, I think he realized it and finally stopped being rude, and stopped the blame. (He did blame be for the remote about 2 months after I stopped watching tv.) It's been ""better"" for about 6-9 months. But once it got better, I realized he only treated me with any respect once I forced him to, by removing myself from him.

Now, I'm happiest when he's out of the house. I don't miss him if we're apart for a week. I am sometimes annoyed if he's in the house because he watches TV 100% of the time he's awake. I don't want to do our normal summer plans, which are fast approaching. So I think I need to tell him asap that i want a divorce. I'm thinking after an upcoming trip he has next week, so I don't ruin the trip. 

How do I start the conversation? How do I avoid getting sucked in a vortex of trying to justify, explain, convince him it's not worth saving? I don't want to work on the marriage. He's had four years to start therapy, alone or with me, so I'm not willing to accept that as an option. I don't hate him, but I don't really like him anymore.

1his38u,relationship_advice,This may be our last Christmas and I (37F) and not really sure where to go from here with husband (41M). Advice?,"2 Christmases ago my husband made me guess the entire month of November what he got me for Christmas. This went on until the week before Christmas when he got real serious one day and said I need to tell you something. He looked me straight in the eyes and said I was just joking with you I never got you anything. I was crushed. We had a major snowstorm coming in two days before Christmas so he was headed to the store knowing this I scraped together the most amount of money I could find like $ 10-15 around the house and asked/begged him to get me something, anything, so that I'd have something to open on Christmas. He came back handed me all the money  I gave him and told me that he didn't get me anything because he didn't want to inconvenience the cashier or the other people in line (he was using self checkout) It wasn't until he saw how devastated he made me that he got me something. It was a beautiful eyeshadow pallet and lipstick but tbh I've never been able to use it because everytime I look at it it brings back those memories.

This year , 2 weekends ago, we went out of town (no shopping here) to get Christmas presents for everyone. We went to an arcade and then he took me to my favorite restaurant. Afterwards we went to a free Christmas drive through light display that we found last year one that was way better than any of the ones we've ever paid for. I thought it was a really good/fun day.  Sunday we went out of town again cause an item he wanted was only available at a store 1 1/2 hrs away and it was also near his favorite drive through light display so we did that and also ate out.

Last weekend I asked him to help me clean. His response was that if he didn't personally make the mess than he shouldn't have to help. Thats just it though. Most of the messes were his. Soda bottles, food wrappers, dirty dishes. Everytime I ask it's an excuse. He helps out he says. What he does is he lets the dogs out and proceeds to sit outside ""watching"" them for hours while he plays on his phone and we have a fenced backyard. He changes cat litter once a week and at the same time trash. That's it. Meanwhile I do everything else. I've been feeling overwhelmed lately and told him I need help I want to be able to sit down and relax too in fact I need to as I'm almost at my breaking point. His response was ""when does he get to relax? He had to take my ass all over the state buying me Christmas presents and seeing Christmas lights instead of relaxing."" He then proceeded to take his ring off and throw it at me and tell me we are done and stonewall me for the rest of the night/next day. 

He put the ring back on but I haven't. Right now I'm just going through the motions. I don't really know what to do or say. Meanwhile he's acting like everything is normal. He's talking about seeing more lights. I'm just done with it / Christmas. I've asked him to take the presents back he got me as I don't want them. Not if he feels that way. 

Really though, It's not about the presents it's about respect, valuing your partner, not making them feel like a burden or that you're obligated to do something. Wanting to celebrate them and your relationship.  

 I finally realized why it is that I got excited for Christmas in November then lose interest when it comes around.  I just don't know what to do now.

1j8xwsd,relationship_advice,I (25M) discovered another side of my girlfriend (26F). I liked it but now she's apologizing. How do I deal with this?,"So me and my girlfriend ""Zoe"" have been together for 2 years. She is my first. She is usually the shy type and always asks me to initiate any contact. Cuddles, kisses, anryhing  - it's all on my side, she never do antyhing like that first. But so far it hasn't bothered me.



We moved in together in February. Nothing special happened at first, but one day after coming home from work she was clearly upset. In 2 years I honestly never seen her this angry. I would say she usually has the patience of a saint, literally the worst curse word I have heard her use was ""idiot"" in reference to a drunk driver. I would also say that she is usually very awkward. So yes, I was surprised and at first I tried to help her. I listened to all her complaints, then I made her favorite dish and wanted to watch our favorite series with her. But after the first episode she kissed me.



She asked me if we could try something new. I was fascinated and curious, so I agreed. She acted like a completely different person for the rest of the night. She was very dominant and at first it was kind of funny to watch, but the longer it went on the more I started to get into it. When did she tie my hands? I was 100% on board. I liked everything, I've never been so relaxed. We also had a few moments where something didn't go as it should, but we just laughed. Which was also new, because usually in such moments Zoe was nervous and wanted to go away.



I don't know, I felt like for the first time we were actually having 100% fun and there was no stress. But the next day Zoe was quieter than usual. She avoided me all morning, and when we saw each other in the evening, she started apologizing for ""forcing herself on me."". I was confused. I asked her a few questions, tried to analyze everything that had happened, but nothing made sense to me. We weren't drunk or anything. We just were having a good time. And we both agreed to everything. I didn't feel like she was forcing me to do anything.



I told her that, but she kept saying it all was a mistake and apologizing. She told me I should break up with her. I told her I don't want to and she didn't do anything wrong. But it's only gotten worse since then. I feel like I have a roommate, not a girlfriend. We barely talk, and when we do Zoe mostly answers my questions and leaves as quickly as she can.



How can I help her? How do I even start this when a simple ""nothing happened"" and ""It was good"" doesn't convince her? I don't want to end this relationship, I really love Zoe, I love her ""normal"" personality, but I also love what she's shown me.

1ndodsd,relationship_advice,UPDATE: My (28F) BF (30M) secretly invited his parents to move into our house without telling me.,"First, thank you to everyone who commented and offered support. Reading your messages really helped me feel seen and validated during all of this. Sorry it took me so long to post an update. Everything got tied up with lawyers and paperwork, and I wanted it settled before sharing.

My ex ended up buying me out of the house. Best decision I’ve ever made. I walked away, had a fresh start, and no dead weight attached to me. I got my own place (got lucky with a very small apartment, left all furniture behind as most was his anyway), focused on work, and honestly my life has been calm, stable, and better than it’s ever been.

Meanwhile, he got exactly what he thought he wanted.The house with his parents in it. And it’s been an absolute train wreck. They moved in permanently, and within days it was obvious they see him less as a son and more as their live-in caretaker. They expect him to cover all the bills, cook, clean, and drop everything for them. They nitpick every little thing, criticize how he runs the house, and remind him daily that he “owes” them for everything they ever did for him.

He’s working longer hours just to keep up financially, and the house that was supposed to be his pride and joy has basically become their space, not his. He has no privacy, no downtime, and no control. From what mutual friends have told me, he’s burned out, bitter, and constantly snapping at everyone around him.

When I confronted him about why he didn’t even tell me about their move-in, he said: “If I told you, you would’ve said no and I couldn’t let them down.” That line still blows my mind. He admitted point-blank that my opinion never mattered. He saw me as a roadblock, not a partner.

So yeah, I dodged a bullet. He chained himself to the exact life I refused to accept, and now he’s drowning in it. I got out clean, and I don’t regret a thing.

Sooo I guess life's going pretty well? :)


Edit: I see a bunch of people calling this post fake because all of this got resolved in two weeks. Honestly that's fair, as it does seem fake.

To be honest with you all, I wrote that first post for validation, as I thought I was going crazy. Either hoping for people to push me to do it or people telling me to take the chill pill.

I had a lawyer and paper work prepared so I could just pull it out immediately if necessary or put it away, pretending this stuff never happened.

As I was not willing to live in this situation, I gave my ex the papers and he pretty much agreed with no fuss. Paid with his own money (dipped a bit into his savings) and things moved fast.

1hfsrlb,relationship_advice,"UPDATE - I (24F) just broke off my engagement with fiance (26M) because he told me he wasn't ready when proposing. We're going to therapy, but I feel like I gave up already. Help?
","I figured I'd post an update to this. I read many comments and they really helped me, thank you for sharing your experiences, that opened my eyes. So yeah, tl;dr he wasn't ready when proposing, he won't admit it but I'm pretty sure it was a ""*shut up ring*"" - which is sad, because I never really cared about marriage in the first place. 

Now, we went to therapy, I said the same things as I've written in the previous post. He struggled to answer any questions, didn't really say anything that he hadn't before. Therapist suggested we could try living separately, but I think she could tell we're going to break up soon lol. I took a few days to think, but finally broke up with him about a week after writting the first post. Aaaaand it kinda broke me to see his reaction. 

At first, he was really dramatic, constantly tried to make himself the victim (*something about ""us"" being a ship that's sinking, I'm about to jump and give up but he's still holding on tightly..???*), accused me of not giving him the chance now that he actually wants to do something and change. I had to remind him a few times that **he's** the one who broke my heart first, he lied for months and took the ring back. Then more dramatics, crying etc. But the next day everything was normal, he was behaving like nothing happened - no more fighting for this relationship or even being hurt, he said ""*we're going to be good friends""* and acted like nothing's happened. Over the next few days, I would occiasionaly get comments like ""*If anyone asks what happened I can't say we broke up, I have to say you broke my heart and left me*"" or ""*At least you stopped pretending you love me""*. Other than that? No crying, no arguments, he was acting as per usual. It just broke my heart (again) to see how he didn't even try, that he really didn't care much.  Shouldn't be surprised, really, yet here we are.

I asked him three times to move out, gave him a deadline of two weeks (so three weeks since he took the ring back). He acted hurt, said ""*Wow, I didn't expect you'd want to get rid of me so soon*"", but didn't really start looking. You know what actually made him get a flat and leave? My parents telling him to fuck off - because he lived here in their home this whole time (without paying any bills, they took him in like a son). They told him to pack his shit and never come back - since then he's been acting offended that they treated him like that and he had to leave.

He moved out yesterday, I helped him with moving. I'm on my own now, after 6,5 years with that one man. New year new me, I guess? 

But yeah, thanks to everyone who commented and read my story, ngl I would love some encouragement - it feels like a part has been ripped from me, I need to know this feeling will go away.



P.S. He found the first post and read the comments, he wanted to post his own comment to show his side of things, thankfully gave up lol.

1lfn3un,relationship_advice,I (31f) had a conversation with my bf (31m) and the rose tinted glasses came off. How can I navigate this?,"UPDATES AT END

Hello all,

I (31f) have been with my partner (31m) for 1 1/2 years.

We love each other, it has been rocky at times and we have nearly been through a break up but each time we talked it out and believed we pulled through.

The main subject of contention has always been his hobby and subsequent club. He is on the volunteer committee, has meetings every Monday and goes every Wednesday and Thursday evening along with some Friday evenings as well as Saturday and Sunday mornings. He also spends several weekends away out of the year to do the hobby and uses holiday time for it too. He does admin outside of this also and has been in trouble at work for doing said admin during work hours and has even done admin during our “quality time.” There have been several incidents at the club and with him being on the committee, he has spent a lot of time dealing with it. So much so it affects his mental health poorly. He has even cancelled plans and changed date nights with me to prioritise his hobby.

This has caused many arguments and conversations which stem from him making a hobby his priority and how he wants me to just slot into his current lifestyle. I explained that this couldn’t happen and we have compromised to try and make it work.

I believed things had turned a corner. However, something changed today.

I’m bisexual. The local pride parade is coming up and I expressed my want to go. We did not make any explicit plans to go together but he stated if he was available, he would go.

He knows how excited I was at this prospect and knows how much this means to me.

However, he messaged me to say he was now doing his hobby instead and couldn’t go.

Now, he said he was asked to go and asked me if this was okay. I felt like I couldn’t say no as in the past I’ve said no and been made to feel guilty because I’m stopping him from doing his hobby. I’m not that kind of person. People make choices. That’s their decision, not mine.

However, I asked him if he ever wanted to go to the pride event and he said “I would have but my hobby is more important.”

And then something in me just, clicked.

This event is important to me. It’s something I’m excited about. It’s something I want to do. The amount of times I’ve sat and taken him to his hobby, watched, helped and supported him without fail and sometimes without being asked. He doesn’t do the same for me, because it’s not as important to him.

It felt like he was saying “I’m not interested in the thing that you find important because it’s not important to me and by extension, you’re not as important as my hobby.”

I didn’t feel anger, or hurt or disappointed. In fact, I didn’t feel anything. And that’s it. I didn’t feel anything for or from him. No love. No support. No companionship.

Nothing.

All the times I’d given up my time, wants and needs to support him and yet here I am with something very important to me and… nothing.

I felt nothing.

The option was there. There was a choice. But I’m conflicted. I love him. We’ve navigated things before.

How can I navigate this further? What advice would you give someone?

Any advice strangers of reddit would be appreciated.


Edited update:

Thank you all for the comments, I’m reading through each one as we speak. I might not reply because I’m still soaking in all the insight. 

Common questions:
To those asking what the hobby is, it’s a sport and a very niche one so I’m not going to detail what it is because that’s not fair on that sport or the people in it.

He isn’t cheating. I’ve been with him on the weekends and taken him to the sport. 

No I’m not Karma fishing. Thanks bot accusers. Throw away new account as I posted on my old account and didn’t interact enough, hence throwaway. I honestly don’t care for the whole karma thing.

I’m seeing him tonight and will show him the post.


UPDATE:

Updating here as I haven’t the freaking foggiest how to do updates.

Sorry for not responding to everyone in the comments… I got overwhelmed honestly.

We broke up.

Reading your responses and information and questions was super helpful and gave me the slap I needed to get my arse in gear and leave.

Just going through the motions (as you do).

Now we’re no longer together. The hobby. Sailing. Fucking

When I fixed it another one of his friends said ""your dad is really good at fixing bikes"" and my girlfriends son said something, but I didnt catch it. Later on he was playing a video game with me. (first time. Me and my girlfriend have been living together full time for five years) I asked him what he said and he didnt remember. So I asked if he thought of me as his dad and he nodded. I teared up and stuttered an just started the game.

I've thought of him as my son for years and told him so, but I dont know how to react. 

His dad isnt in the picture (prison) and my girlfriends ex who he tried to call dad when he was little would yell at him for it. 

My dad was a POS and didnt want anything to do with me. I didnt have a gather figure to use as an example.

1l0grw9,relationship_advice,I (F32) got wasted. My boyfriend (M34) is disappointed and disgusted with me. How can I solve this?,"It has been a crazy week for me. The whole month was stressful at work. This month end, I went to a party to celebrate a former co-worker's last day in our last job together. I was confident to keep taking shots as I had a full dinner prior and I was thinking they are already tipsy while I'm still sober. And then it hit me. I was blacked out. All I remember is that I was vomiting in the car, my face held to the window to keep my vomit out. My boyfriend was working at home for his night shift. Got me out of my friends' car but was shocked I can't walk, can't even sit on the chair. I was still vomiting and he was so stressed to leave me on our bed as I might choke with my vomit . It was the drunkest I have been. I am ashamed. I know it's a mistake. I can't live without him and right now it's been 2 days of no talking. He looks at me angry. I know it's all on me.

1ljx7qz,relationship_advice,"I (27F) found a long black hair in our bathtub that is not my, or my husbands (27m). What to do?","Yesterday, I gave the bathroom a deep cleaning, today I was gone for half the day. When I came home and went to take a bath, I noticed a long black hair in the tub and I'm blonde. He has short hair. I've never had any reason to think he would cheat, but a few months ago, I had some suspicions that he was tracking my location without my knowing. He's very tech savvy unlike me, and after some strange phone calls and other odd things that happened, I started to feel like I was being tracked. I made a comment about it, and the strange things stopped happening. I kind of forgot about the whole incident and decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. But now... the thoughts that are popping into my head are, ""what if he was and is tracking my location after all, so he could cheat"".  I've had paranoid spirals in the past, and I don't know if I'm blowing this way out of portion or seeing something that's not there because my mind wanders too much.. I haven't said anything to him yet because I don't want to stress him out over nothing. And again, until now the thought has never once crossed my mind that he wouldn't be faithful. Is this concerning or am I being ridiculous?

Edit: I'm getting more comments than I can keep up with, but I really appreciate everyone that's left a comment. I love having this place to come with questions I can't ask anyone else, it's always very helpful.  I'm going to try some non-intrusive things that have been suggested, I don't want to do anything that would cross a boundary or break his trust, even if I do turn up something. I just don't feel right going through his phone or installing cameras etc. I'll try searching the tub drain, lint rolling around the house, possibly having my phone searched for spyware and truck looked over for an air tag.  I also think I could easily leave my phone behind one day, and drive home because ""I forgot something"" and gauge his reaction. There's lots of comment's that have been left that I'll go through again that have to do with checking my phone and the different ways he could track me. I'm not going to assume he's guilty or anything, it's mostly for my peace of mind. If anything comes up from this, or not, I'll leave an update.

Edit 2: Just updating cause a few people are worried. I've tried a few things so far, turning off my location while his phone was visible, and no notifications came up. lint rolled around the apartment didn't turn up anything concerning either and the tub drain is clear. I'm starting to think the hair was nothing, just tracked in. However...I'm not so confident he hasn't been or hasn't tracked me in the past.  So, I went to my parents a few days ago and genuinely forgot something at the apartment. I realized this was a perfect opportunity, I left my phone at my parents and drove back to get the thing I forgot.  When I walked in, he was laying on the bed reading and he did look quite surprised. (the bed is visible when you walk in because we live in a one bedroom and he needs the bedroom for his office because he works from home) and he said ""why are you back already?"" I told him what I forgot. He looked...upset, and in a more whiny tone said ""but you aren't supposed to be back yet"". He jokes around a lot where he acts overly dramatic and sometimes I can't tell, and I have to ask him if he's joking or not. I said, ""I'm not getting a very warm welcome"" and asked him why he's acting so weird, and he says he just doesn't want to have to get up. (sometimes I sit on the bed to read but I wouldn't have pushed him out). Once again, no proof of anything, just odd. It could be he just wasn't expecting me back so early...but, I've forgotten things before and didn't have a reaction like that.  That's all that came out of that encounter, but I'm going to do it again and see if I keep getting odd reactions. I have yet to have my phone gone through.

Also, I'm copy pasting a comment I left explaining why I suspected the tracking stuff in the first place:  It wasn't obvious enough that it couldn't have just been a coincidence, which is why I wrote it off at first. For a while, every time I was on my way home (I get home at very unpredictable times because of my job)  and only a few minutes away, he would call me and ask if I was on my way home. After it happened like 4 or 5 times, I said ""how are you always calling me right before I get home?"" he laughed it off and said it was a coincidence, but then it never happened again after that.  There was another time I picked up fast food that was out of my way halfway thought the day. When I got home later that night, he said something along the lines of ""have you been eating fries?"". I didn't reply, I was just shocked he could've guessed, he just said he was kidding. There was another time that I told him I was going to my parents house, but ended up running some errands first. I get a call from him shortly after asking me why I wasn't at my parents house? Turns out he had headed to my parents because he wanted me to try some plain white rice he got? weird reason to go all the way there. Unless he knew I wasn't going to be there and wanted an excuse to call and ask me where I was. I think there was some more stuff, I was writing it all down for a while. Then when the strange things stopped happening, I was like whatever, it's probably nothing anyways.

  
Another update: Soo my memory was jogged. Someone mentioned that he might be able to do find my phone if he logs into my accounts. A while ago when we were newly married, he had me sign into his computer with my account. I hesitated, and said I'd rather not, but he said he would log out, it was just to make something easier ( I can't remember what). I still didn't want to, but ended up doing it to appease him. Just now, I looked it up myself...and all I had to do was google it from my account and I can see my phone. I can't believe how easy that was. He could easily be doing that from his computer. I think I can disable it from my phone, but it's still showing the location that it's at right now. so, I'm going to try and drive somewhere else with my laptop and log back in to see if the location has changed...",3643,0.96,3643,0,3801.0,158.0,1015,1750828454.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ljx7qz/i_27f_found_a_long_black_hair_in_our_bathtub_that/,False,True
1jni07c,relationship_advice,"UPDATE: My (M30) younger brother's (M28) girlfriend (F25) said something that made me (and everyone else in the room) super uncomfortable. It's been months and it's still a problem, how do I get everyone to move past this?","Met up with John at a sports bar we go to sometimes when our dad is in town. Shot the shit for a little bit before I asked him if everything was cool. He didn't really know what I was talking about at first, I had to remind him ""that weird thing at the family dinner?"" and he immediately knew what I was talking about. I asked if we were all right, if they were all right, and lastly what we should do about our nosy Catholic relatives gossiping about all this shit.

First off, he confirmed what I (and most of y'all) thought was true: Jane was talking about my cooking exclusively. She's a big fan, it's actually the reason she came to that gathering in the first place. So that's good to hear. Nothing to do with my physique, though John did congratulate me on the additional weight I'd lost since the whole ordeal.

Second, John's issue with Jane's joke had nothing to do with the idea of her leaving him for me or that he'd lost some prestige as the athlete in our family or anything like that. Something I didn't mention in the original post because I didn't think it was important is that John and I grew up middle class while Jane's family is loaded. Not billionaires but she graduated from an Ivy League college with no student loans, which she's turned into a well-paying and highly specialized tech job. She and John go on lots of vacations together, have a very nice apartment in a very expensive part of the city, all that stuff.

The thing is, while John does pretty well for himself at work, he's not making nearly as much as she is and doesn't have old family money to fall back on. Trying to keep up with her has been putting a significant dent in his savings. Apparently, he's been psyching himself up to talk to her about how they may need to make some lifestyle adjustments so he can put more money away in savings and was worried how that might go. Hearing her say that I might be a better option after hearing about my new, to his mind high-earning PhD program was the sort of thing that came at exactly the wrong time, so he had to walk away. (I did have a little laugh at that, this PhD will open a lot of doors for me but it's definitely not going to make me millionaire)

Adding to the sting of that, while he and I don't have much of a rivalry he does still have some insecurity about me being ""the smart one"" of the two of us. I say this with all the love in my heart: John is an extremely intelligent guy but you'd never know that from just talking to him. He's a whiz with numbers and knows more about corporate finance than nearly anyone I've ever met at any age; he also speaks with the vocabulary and goofy demeanor of a frat boy. So on top of the anxiety about his rich girlfriend thinking he's too broke to hang out, he was a little frustrated about the idea of a doctorate putting more perceived distance between us.

He apologized for that jealousy, I told him it was fine and if folks were giving him shit he could tell them he wasn't going to look over their stock portfolios anymore. He also said that he and Jane spoke about the money and she took it very well, the reason he hadn't been in touch lately was because they'd been looking for a more affordable apartment to move to when their lease is up.

The only thing that left was how to handle the extended family. Apparently John didn't know they were still on about that, largely because whenever he and Jane see them they just talk about how Flo has too many piercings and swears too much. That gossip was news to me, so we mutually said, eh, fuck 'em, and decided to continue not really letting what they say about our partners get to us. Instead, we agreed to spend more time just the four of us. And, before we left for the night, John did ask me for a few of my recipes.",3632,0.98,3632,0,3708.0,76.0,78,1743356771.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jni07c/update_my_m30_younger_brothers_m28_girlfriend_f25/,False,True

He texted me (hes at work) and asked me a bunch of questions because he got the notification that a new device connected. I told him it was me connecting my laptop and he asked me how I got the pw. I told him how and he got upset. I asked him why its a problem for me to know the pw, but he ignored me and so I went the petty route and just disconnected everything and told him I won't use HIS things anymore (and I'll just use my mobile hotspot).

1n6xjc6,relationship_advice,I (29F) broke up with my partner (30M) after a surprise party,"I'm looking to see how others wouldve reacted to this situation... For context, I've been dating my now ex for 5 months. Things were mostly smooth except the little things that were becoming consistent. He would often change, delay, and/or cancel plans last minute for a variety of reasons. He often knew things would change but didn't let me know until right before we were to meet up. He was 30 min late to our first date.

I'm a person who really values their time and requires a bit of planning. I have been understanding, forgiving, and flexible to his everchanging timeline. I did bring up several times, that of this became consistent, it would be a problem. Then I told him that it would be a complete deal breaker if he cancelled big plans. He always promised to ""make it up to me"" but never did and he never changed.

Well, that time came. He was away for work for a month with minimal to no contact due to the nature of his work. We had planned to rejoice the night he came back. It started off with him saying he'd come straight to my place. Then he said he needed to drop off stuff and get clothes at his place(he lives with his family). A few minutes later he calls me to tell me he's staying to have dinner with his parents. I told him that it was upsetting because I had dinner waiting for him...his first question was to ask what it was.....Then he texts me to tell me he won't be long and insisted he'd come over even after I said not to worry about it right now. I'm waiting and waiting. I get a call but couldn't answer right away but received a text stating that his family had a surprise party for him and that he wasn't coming at all after all. No invite, no acknowledgement of the hurt, and a vague, noncommittal plan to ""come over first thing tomorrow."" 

That was it for me. I waited a whole month for him and planned several days in advance to have a nice dinner. Cleaned my apartment top to bottom, shaved, got dolled up....for nothing. I called him out and told him that it was weird his family planned a surprise party knowing we had plans AND didn't even bother to invite me. He started back pedaling and saying I was invited and that he wanted to see me. I stood my ground and told him that I couldn't do this anymore. I stayed firm in my decision and had him pick up his things the next day. I wonder if I was too harsh in not having a more in-depth conversation about the issue although my decision would've been the same. 

TLDR. Broke up with my bf because he was consistently flaky. He knew my boundary but decided to disrespect it. What would you have done? was I too harsh?

1kll1er,relationship_advice,My(35f) boyfriend (32m) is mad about what I said about his sisters (29f) miscarriage and weight and I don’t know how to fix the situation?,"TW for miscarriages and fertility I suppose. 

One of my boyfriend sisters, Cindy, had a miscarriage back in December. Her doctor told her that it was because of her weight, and if she ever wanted to have a baby she needed to loose at least 100 Ibs. After that she went on all sorts of diets trying to shed the weight. Keto, cabbage soup, 1,000 calories a day, you name it she tried it. And she did loose weight. A lot of it. Really fast. She was losing almost 20 ibs a month, and she looked awful. 

And during all of this, she continued to actively try to have a baby. She got two positive pregnancy tests, both confirmed by a doctor, but neither made it past 8 weeks. Each time she miscarried she was further devastated and couldn’t understand why she lost the baby when she was doing what her doctor said and losing weight.  

She was very vocal about all of this. Both with family, and at our shared work place. Crying in the break room, taking extra days off to see her faith healer, constantly asking people to pray for her and her lost babies souls. It’s really, really sad. 

She called out for her third miscarriage this weekend and blew up the group chat telling my BF and I that we absolutely had go to 'church' with her and her husband on Saturday night and to cancel the date we'd had planned for months. My boyfriend is a good man, but he's also getting tired of having to drop everything for his sisters grief. When we were getting ready for church he told me he didn’t understand why Cindy was still having so much trouble when she’s losing so much weight.

In a former life (ie, pre-Covid) I was studying to be a dietitian. Due to financial constraints I didn’t finish, but I still have a solid knowledge on the subject. 

So I told my boyfriend that I thought that the rapid weight loss is probably hurting things more than helping. Cindy has essentially told her body that they’re starving to death, use up all the fat reserved so they can survive, etc. and if her body thinks they don’t have enough food for them to live then it’s definitely not going to waste energy on forming a baby. Pregnancy is intensely taxing on the body, a body in a state of constant, months long caloric deficit isn’t going to let her stay pregnant. She needs to reach her goal weight and stay there for a while before trying to get pregnant again. 

I also think she needs to talk to an actual fertility specialist, or at least an OBGYN, instead of her family doctor who (from what Cindy said) he didn’t actually run any tests, just saw a fat woman who’d had a miscarriage and told her to loose 2/5 of her body weight so she didn’t ""kill her future babies"".

Also a therapist, because her ‘faith healer’ is trying to get her to wear a crystal belt to ‘unlock her fertility chakra’. She's a snake oil saleswoman who's slapping together new age crystal bullshit with Pentecostalism willie nillie to scam vulnerable people out of their money. 

My boyfriend apparently told Cindy  what I said, trying to help, and now she’s flown off the handle and sent me twenty texts telling me I don’t know what I’m talking about and I’m a bitch who’s never supported her. Which, maybe I don’t 🤷‍♀️ I haven’t examined her, I’m not privy to her entire medical history, and I'm not any kind of firtility expert. I know that rapid weight loss hurts your body though. And I only know what she’s said. Which is quite a lot, if we’re being honest. She hasn’t talked about anything that isn’t dead babies or weight loss related in 6 months. 

So now I’m being asked to switch shifts at work, or at least work areas, until the whole thing blows over. And I'm not allowed near any family functions. My boyfriend is solidly on his sisters 'side' that I was talking out of turn for speculating like that. He doesn't want to be with me until I can figure out how to fix the damage I did to my relationship with his sister. 

I really don't know how I'm supposed to make amends with her, or where to even start. ",3621,0.97,3621,0,3737.0,116.0,586,1747140422.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kll1er/my35f_boyfriend_32m_is_mad_about_what_i_said/,False,True
1ljg4ax,relationship_advice,"I’m (26F) supposed to be getting married in 6 months to my fiancé (28M). I just got offered a major promotion, but he’s said no to moving. I don’t know what to do.","My fiancé and I have been together for nearly seven years. We’ve built a life together. We own a house, have pets, and are supposed to be getting married in six months. From the outside, everything looks stable. But inside, I’m falling apart trying to carry all of it.

I was just offered a major promotion at work. It’s a big step forward, and something I’ve been working toward for over two years. It would mean moving to a new city, but also comes with a pay increase that would DOUBLE!!! my salary. Also, a chance to finally move into a more senior role. It’s the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come around often, and I’m very young to get the offer. 

When I brought it up to my partner, he basically shut it down. He said he isn’t ready to move for at least 6 months and would prefer to never move. Unfortunately, the company needs an answer soon, and my current role is being eliminated in 2 months. I won’t have a job, if I continue to wait. 

This promotion has made me confront some other issues in our relationship. I’ve been carrying the emotional and household labor in our relationship for a long time. I planned the wedding, I do the majority of the household Labor Day to day, I manage our pets, and I built our social life. I also support us financially and emotionally. He absolutely contributes financially, he owns the house and helps with logistics. But the day to day chores and work is on me. 

Emotionally, I also don’t feel very supported. When I’m upset or struggling, he tends to withdraw or ignore it. If I try to share what I’m going through, he’ll change the subject or make a joke. I’ve tried to explain what I need. Presence, care, curiosity, a little warmth. It rarely happens. When I bring this up, he gets defensive or frustrated.

Now with this job offer on the table, I feel completely stuck. If I stay, I feel like I’m giving up an amazing opportunity. But if I go, it might mean ending a relationship I’ve poured years of love and effort into.

Any recommendations from people that have been in this position? 

Edit: The job is in another state, Im looking at up to 200k income, and it’s closer to my family. My fiancé can also keep his job with the move. He owns the house, I pay rent. 50/50 on all the other bills/expenses.

1i6lcme,relationship_advice,My husband (29 M) keeps calling me (29F) and dog murderer ,"My husband calls me a dog murderer

Obvious trigger warning: dog death and mention of suicide.

7 years ago I got a call from my husband at work saying he needed his headphones and asked me to come drop them off for him at work. I brought his dog along with me to say hi. I rolled down the window so our dog could smell outside. At a stop light, he saw a family walking by and jumped out of the window, getting hit by multiple cars. I rushed him to the vet ER but he passed away on site. It was extremely traumatizing for me and I was diagnosed with PTSD.
He only outwardly blamed me for his dog's death once after it happened. It's coming back up now and it's nearly an every day thing where he calls me a dog killer. It's not like he's processing it through therapy (he never has) so its not like its coming back up there, this is out the blue. He keeps talking to our current dog saying things like ""don't go in the car with mom, she'll kill ya"". 
He does stuff like this all the time. Blaming me for losing his things, his mental health, financial situations. We know he needs therapy, but when he went for a year, he wouldn't talk to the doctor. I'm so tired of him breaking me down. But he's my husband. Is this a deal breaker? I feel like this is something you'd get a divorce over, but he's also told me that I'm the only thing keeping him alive. He'd likely commit if I left him.
Should I leave him or try and work this out with him?

I mention this because it’s relevant, but he has NEVER EVER been abusive or manipulative either verbally, physically, or emotionally. Never ever a hint of any of that nonsense. We’re both very levelheaded people so no crazy fights with screaming or anything like that as we view that as disrespectful. There are some disagreements and stresses we have as we’re long distance and pursuing different paths in life at the moment, but we have a very healthy relationship.

Now here’s the main issue and it’s kind of insane-sounding but idk. A couple of months ago we were having a civil disagreement about something, and he was glancing at me from the corner of his eye and speaking to me - and the look in his eyes genuinely scared the shit out of me. And it’s not about the eye color or anything like that. It’s the LOOK. You know how you hear about the “soulless” eyes that serial killers have?? Like no joke, that was 100% there. And I haven’t ever gotten that “something is wrong, you need to run” feeling before with anyone else’s. It obviously wasn’t anything intentional on his part and he was speaking very calmly but I immediately stopped disagreeing and just accepted whatever he was saying because i was so unnerved. 

I didn’t mention anything to him and just ignored it. But the next time we disagreed about something, the “look” was back and again i got so genuinely frightened i just agreed with whatever he was saying. This doesn’t happen every time we disagree or argue but it happens enough to make me question whether I’m safe with him. I know a lot of people say this on this app, but he’s actually an amazing partner to me and i’m so very happy with him. 

I’m just looking for advice on what to do next and how seriously I should consider this feeling. ",3579,0.92,3579,0,3920.0,341.0,800,1736478059.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hxury6/my_19f_boyfriend_20ms_eyes_scare_the_crap_out_of/,False,True

I just don’t understand why he thinks I would do this as I’ve never been unfaithful. Has anyone else experienced this? What happened if you have dealt with this? I mentioned marriage counseling to him so we might try that but I’m just so confused, sad, and hurt about this. We’ve been fighting off and on as it’s been stressful having two kids so close together but we otherwise don’t have any huge problems in the relationship.

1ohq121,relationship_advice,My (37f) Husband (38m) was fired for sexual harassment,"I (37f) have been married for 8 years to my husband (38m) and we have two kids together. Last week my husband was fired for sexual harassment. He told me that he was flirting with a coworker who is not his direct report but is lower on the hierarchy than he is. He says that she initiated the first flirtation but after than he found her on facebook and started messaging her. She ended up showing the messages to HR and he was fired. He deleted the messages so I don’t know what was said but he claims he asked her to send a clothed picture.  

I am at a loss for what to do here. Do I stay with him and try to move past this or is it a big enough deal to leave him?

Other potentially relevant information:
-I know he has messaged at least one other woman. I saw those messages and they were not sexual but they were flirtatious.
-I only work part time, so leaving him is complicated by the fact that I would also need to find a new job.
-He doesn’t have anywhere else to stay so we have to keep living together at least until the job situation is resolved.

Edit to add: Because so many comments have brought up the “clothed” part, I asked him about it.

1jx34jj,relationship_advice,Update: My (23F) partner (26M) stormed out of our apartment after I told him I couldn’t give him the support he wanted because my friend died. Help?,"Hi, I just wanted to come on here to say one thing: everyone who said he’s abusive was completely correct. 

These past 48 hours have been nothing short of a nightmare. My now ex bf started with extremely apologetic texts, telling me how he never meant to react like that, that he’ll get therapy, that he’ll do anything if I just come back home. Once those didn’t get a response, he started getting desperate. There were a lot of threats of suicide, he told me he needed me to drive him to the mental hospital because he didn’t trust himself. At that point I called him and I told him I’d call a welfare check for him, but I won’t be driving him anywhere. Then he got mean, telling me that I should consider myself lucky that he loves me because no one else ever will. He accused me of sleeping around, he told me that my friend killed herself because I neglected her just like I’m neglecting him. That shit broke me. I told him that we’re done and that I need to come get my stuff, so he needs to be out of the apartment. I also told him that I wasn’t coming alone and that my brother and my BIL were coming to help me. 

I went to get my things earlier today while he was at work. He trashed my apartment. There were holes in the walls. He destroyed all my clothing. He tore up photos. My makeup is ruined. Anything that he thought might have sentimental value to me is destroyed. 

Fuck man.

I took photos of everything. I don’t know what to do about the damage to the actual walls of my apartment or what to do about the lease. I’m thinking of filing a protective order against him in case he starts showing up to my job. 

I’m just done. I’m checking out for a while and I’m going to focus on restarting and getting myself back together.

1jd2ef3,relationship_advice,Sister in law (34/F) became pregnant weeks after my wife (36/F) had a successful embryo implantation and now my wife is furious at my (37/M) entire side of the family. Has anyone been through this and have advice for me to navigate situation?,"Yeah as the title says we as of now have a successful embryo implantation done at the end of February and my brother let me know about a very early positive pregnancy test this last week after they began trying after their wedding this summer. Ever since I told my wife she has been furious with me, my sister in law, and my mother. She refuses to have a sustained conversation about it but from what she has told me she is upset that they knew everything we had to go through to get pregnant and then go get pregnant weeks after we did in which was supposed to be her moment. Separately she is mad at me because I do not seem excited for the baby and that I ""want the baby to miscarry"" after I made a comment that I was nervous to be excited until after the first trimester when she asked how I felt about the becoming a father. She is also mad at my mother after she told some family members after the implantation before we told her not to say anything.

All and all I'm not sure what to do about this. She has basically gone no contact with my side of the family over it and is refusing to speak to me. I want to be there and support my wife but I also feel that my brother and his wife as newlyweds in their mid 30s have the right to become pregnant whenever they want and wish nothing but the best for journey.

1lwnuyy,relationship_advice,"My (41M) Wife (43F) openly has a least favorite child.  ""Can't deal with her""","We've been married for around 13 years and have three daughters: ages 11, 8, and 6.

Our oldest is 11 and has a mild form of autism, what used to be called Asperger’s. She's a very easygoing kid. She does what she’s asked when she’s asked, rarely asks for anything, and is content in her own bubble. She's introverted and has the most in common with her mom. She’s homeschooled, like her mom was, and really thrives in that setup.

Our youngest, who is 6, has high-needs autism. She attends year-round special education and is an elopement risk. It’s a full-time stress and struggle, but she’s also a sweet and affectionate child.

Our middle daughter, age 8, is something else entirely. She's neurotypical and, by her own request, goes to public school. I don’t know where she gets it from, but she turns everything into a negotiation and will argue to the end. She constantly wants something bought for her, done for her, or to be taken somewhere. If you tell her she can pick one thing at the store, she’ll pick three and try to make you feel guilty for saying no.

She’s extremely extroverted, always with friends or at someone’s house in the neighborhood. Anytime she has her iPad, she’ll FaceTime her best friend from school and could stay on the call for hours if we let her. My wife tried to homeschool her too, but the constant arguing and negotiating made it impossible. She begged to go to public school, just finished her first year, and absolutely loved it. She also enjoys pushing her older sister’s buttons and getting a reaction.

The interesting part is that when she's at school or with friends’ parents, she gets glowing reports. No issues, no complaints. And when I’m parenting solo while my wife is away, things tend to go more smoothly. I’m more direct, I don’t negotiate, and I don’t offer second chances. It’s not about being harsh, but if you give her an inch, she’ll take a mile.

When both of us are home, the dynamic shifts. My wife often gets drawn into long verbal battles with her, takes the disobedience personally, and eventually calls me in once it’s already escalated. By then, our daughter is past the point of reasoning. No consequence or logical redirection seems to work. It could start with something as small as “time to brush your teeth,” and spiral into a full meltdown because she decides she wants a snack instead.

Even after I’ve defused the situation and moved on, my wife sometimes brings it back up minutes later with a comment like, “I can’t believe you…” It feels like she’s trying to win the argument after the fact.

When our middle daughter went camping with her best friend for the Fourth of July, my wife came through the door afterward and yelled, “Middle is gone!” She frequently makes indirect comments implying that our middle daughter is difficult or always causing problems. I can’t help but feel like that kind of labeling only makes things worse.

When I offer gentle suggestions, my wife often shuts them down. She’ll say things like, “You don’t know what she does to me,” or “She behaves better for you because you’re not with her as much.”

Has anyone else dealt with a dynamic like this between a parent and child, or between co-parents, and found any strategies that helped reset the relationship?

**TL;DR:** My wife really struggles with our middle child, who is strong-willed and argumentative. She does better for me and in other environments, but things often escalate when the two of them interact at home.",3480,0.97,3480,0,3591.0,111.0,613,1752180632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lwnuyy/my_41m_wife_43f_openly_has_a_least_favorite_child/,False,True

We have a tradition that a week before Christmas, we would open a present early.

Our son opened the big box that was presented and the box said ps5 pro. The weight was even pretty similar to a box with the ps5 pro.

When he opened it up though, all he saw were rocks and a t-shirt that said no.1 dad. I was furious but my husband was laughing and said that he used his friend's ps5 pro box to pull off this prank.

1o65835,relationship_advice,"Update: I (m40) got into an argument with my wife (f39) because I ""don't take initiative in life."" How do I learn to take the lead and not be a ""passenger in my own life?""","[Original Post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mae7ae/i_m40_got_into_an_argument_with_my_wife_f39/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

After I made my original post I spent a lot of time thinking about what she and people here had said, not just about planning date nights, picking TV shows, or being more up to date on news/current events, but more about showing up as my own person in our relationship. I realized that for years I thought being ""easy going"" was a good thing. I thought that by going along with what she wanted I was being a good partner and letting her have what she wanted, but really I was avoiding responsibility or taking risk in our relationship. I wasn't showing her who I am or putting any care into anything.

I have made a few changes since my post, I have planned some date nights and things to do instead of waiting for her to make plans for us to avoid doing nothing ( a problem we had fallen into.) Some times she likes what I have planned, sometime not so much, but I think she appreciates the effort.

I have been speaking up and paying attention more, even about little things. What I think about a tv show or place we have been for the first time. Offering more than ""It was okay"" or ""it was alright"" but offering some actual opinions that don't dead end the conversation. I have been paying attention more to the news and current events, and even though many times I don't really have an opinion about things I offer what I can to show some interest. It's awkward at times, but better than just doing nothing.

I am also reconnecting with some interests that I had let go over the years, been more willing to spend time with some friends instead of choosing to stay home and scroll. I have also restarted some old hobbies, hiking and mineral collecting, which I can do on my own, or she has come with me a few times. She seems happy I am out doing things on my own and reconnecting with friends after so many years I think.

The biggest change was how I think about ""taking initiative"" and ""taking the lead"", it's not about being the boss or the one to make all the decisions, it's about being present and curious about the world and what is around me and wanting to do more when we are on a trip than sitting on my phone and scrolling for hours.

So in an almost exact mirror of what happen in my last post, again last weekend we traveled so she could give another training and I drove us there. Again she took the car, but instead of just hanging out in the hotel room and waiting for her to come back, I used the bus system and went to the worlds biggest comic shop, saw a few historical/touristy spots, had lunch and found a huge flea market for us to go to on Sunday morning before driving home. It was a very different weekend than the last. She was most surprised when I had picked an Indian spot for dinner Saturday night, I am not a very adventurous eater and have shied away from trying foreign foods, this was my first time trying Indian, and she has always been an adventurous eater so I really caught her off guard with that,

There is still work to do, but I think we are in a much better place than when I posted before. She has said she has seen a difference and said she feels she is seeing me be more ""me"" again.

Thanks to the people who responded to my OG post, your advise helped, even the harsh replies.

1okijll,relationship_advice,My 25f friend 27m who I’ve been rejecting for a year saved me. Our friend group is saying I have tho give him a chance but I can’t tell them the truth about why I can’t?,"This is affecting me badly, I feel so incredibly guilty but it’s a long story.

So in 25f, I met all my girlfriends in college, and the guys joined the group as the all started dating.

I have never dated or had my first kiss.i have rejected every guy whose ever approached me… I have a lot of reasons. I’m not a good person, and I’m not strong or smart. I have quite a bit of debt, my mom passed a few years ago and I’m having a hard time still, I lived in my car after she passed. I just can’t handle things like a regular adult for some reason, I fall apart fast, have panic attacks, and I have made bad financial choices.. long story short I’m not the “full package”

But unfortunately I fake everything. Everyone thinks I’m fine, nobody knew it when I was homeless and I’ve never ever told anyone anything about my mental health struggles or anything bad in my life

So, one guy has had a crush on me for a while now. He always comes to my work and brings me treats.. I kept trying to tell him he doesn’t want to be with me, and kinda tried to hint to him I’m not doing good but he never got it

I had another guy 25m I worked with that also always asked me out and i rejected him. I was more blunt with him and just said I wasn’t interested. I don’t want to get into full details but we were alone at work one night, and he tried to hurt me and was pulling off my uniform.

It was very blurry, happened in the back and I was screaming really loudly and my friend had came in to see me. 

My coworker was obviously fired and he was taken to the hospital. It was not good, and my friend who saved me (which I’m great for) got into a bit of trouble, not 100% what’s going to happen I hope nothing but it wasn’t much of a fight, and one ended unconscious. 

He also stuck with me in the hospital afterwards and braided my hair for me 


Obviously I’m really really grateful and I told him that. I have baked him so much food and cooked him dinner and have done anything to try to make it up to him. But, he obviously is still into me. And he’s frustrated, which i understand.
 

But our friends are also frustrated with me now and have talked about it non stop and it’s been too much for me to handle

I can’t tell them the truth; I also can’t exactly let him in and then lie. The night was also extremely traumatic and everytime they bring it up it plays back in my head and it’s torture 

I tried to talk to him and say I couldn’t tell him but I’m not doing good and I think for his sake it’s not a good idea but he said he doesn’t care and it’s not my choice to make for him. 

I’m really doing bad. I almost feel like I want to die because my brain is not working, and like I said I’m really not strong.

1jzgui5,relationship_advice,"My fiancé (44M) and I (29F) moved to a certain race dominated town and he’s acting odd, where to go from here?","My fiancé and I moved here 3 weeks ago for his new job. I am so proud of him for this. I helped him during the interview process, shaved his beard, lined it up, gave him certain things I used when I worked in an office. I picked out his clothing.. etc, we were excited about the opportunity. Although I’d be two hours from my family and friends we thought it’d be a great start. Plus the pay is amazing. 

Obviously my mother had some issues with it but wished us the best. My son’s father went insane, but I said I would gladly meet him somewhere closer for pick up and drop offs. I have sole custody so I double checked and I was allowed to change school and move our son. He had notice of it but only got mad when I turned down his proposal to date again. He thought my fiancé getting a new job far away meant I’ll go back to his cheating abusive self (narcissistic)

Now my issue is…. I’m black (Caribbean) my fiancé is white Canadian. This new city is primarily white. I get way my stares here in the last 3 weeks than I have in my entire life. For example, I was driving to pick up my son from school and this lady almost crashed her car breaking her neck staring at me. This other gentleman in his car beside me at a red light, again kept staring at me. Just today I had an older man I saw sitting on his porch, leave his porch to walk 4 houses down (where I parked my car, waiting for my sons bell to ring) to walk next to my car and peep inside.

Whether my fiancé wants to admit it or not, I’m being stared at like I’m some kinda new species of human.

 I started to notice when my fiancé and I go grocery shopping, he says let’s “separate” and meet up when it’s time to pay. Odd, I thought but let it go. We went to winners, same thing. He said for us to “separate”. Then again and an antique store, we were getting a lot of looks and he literally just disappeared. Like I did not even know how long he was gone while I was talking to myself before I turned around to see him gone. He claimed he told me he was going to the washroom but he definitely did not. 

I know his job is very important in this town and he did mention everyone at his job is all Caucasians. Not a single person of them are any other race so now I have this gut feeling, he does not want them to know that I am black because he’s afraid they’ll think of him “differently”. That’s why when we are out he wants to be apart. I’ve brought this up to him and he said he just felt he was being clingy lately but yet, yesterday we visited old friends and he was all over me. Like he usually is. I feel like this is grounds for a breakup because clearly he’s uncomfortable about being seen with me in public which makes me extremely self conscious and just sad….. I feel pretty much even more alone. 

Update:

Thank you to everyone that commented on my post. I did not expect to have so many responses but I wanted to give an update. 

I’ll try to make this short. I spoke to him again about how I’m feeling and he kind of brushed it off. Then I said it’s best my son and I leave so he won’t have to worry about being embarrassed by us. He came home from work and started apologizing and crying. Saying he can see why I thought that but it was far from the truth. He said he was just stressed with work and wasn’t thinking. He promised he’ll take me out this weekend and treat me how he would always. I wanted to believe him but something was off. He left, came back home after work with flowers and wine. But then immediately started an argument and shouted.

Here’s what I just realized last night. Last week we went to the gym and he wanted to schedule the trainer for yesterday at 6pm. Which I thought was odd since that’s our usually dinner time but thought whatever. It’s one missed dinner. But then I told him my trainer emailed me and wanted to combine our training and he’ll email me to let me know how my finances training went. When I told my fiancé he immediately said maybe it’s best he reschedule for Saturday so we can all just meet. 

Now last night he weirdly started the argument at 5:45pm. He claimed he needed to go to the gym to calm down… but literally put on his fav shirt, fav date shoes, and his fancy watch. He stormed out the door and left. He started messaging me and I said I thought it was odd he got dressed up to go the gym. Within 5 min he came back saying he was just gonna go to the pub close by and started talking normally expressing how much he loves me. 

Thinking back, I did notice when it was dinner time on weekdays. He wouldn’t finish his dinner or said he wasn’t hungry. But on weekends he can eat three meals a day. 

He went from saying how excited he was for me to visit his work, to saying it’ll be best if I come when he’s more set up. 

I also noticed he’d wake up at 5am rather than 8am on weekdays. I thought maybe he was just stress. But last night the fact that he started an argument dressed up and left around the exact same time he scheduled his gym training just seems fishy. I’m starting to believe maybe he’s having an affair and he’s embarrassed for her to find out that I am black. Everyone at his works knows he’s engaged. The man who gave him his position is his friend of 20 years. So I don’t think he’s hiding he’s in a relationship at work…

1hp9wg7,relationship_advice,I (single 48F) woke up to this text this morning from my colleague (married 51M) and friend of 5 years,"I (single 48F) woke up to this text this morning from my colleague (married 51M) and friend of 5 years. I am so upset that he sent this to me. He said he’s pretty sure none of this would come as a shock to me. Um, YES IT DID!! I thought we were friends. We work in the same department and have to work together every single day. He’s married!! I, honest to God, thought our friendship has been nothing more than just that. Friends. I have asked myself if I’ve given any mixed singles and I swear I haven’t. When we went to BWW 5 years ago, it was after we had to meet a customer together and so we went to lunch. I don’t even remember what we talked about but I promise you, it was small talk. I remember this lunch specifically because we both got Covid afterwards. I treat him the same way I treat my other colleagues (many also friends). I have always felt comfortable and safe around him because he is married (for 20+ years). I was in a relationship 4 of the 5 years I have known him. I have NEVER looked at him in a romantic way and never will. I don’t understand why he would send this to me because it changes everything. I haven’t responded to him because I don’t know what to say. Btw, I go to lunch with him and other colleagues from time to time. We go as a group or sometimes 1 on 1. I think I’m upset because I really appreciated his friendship and now I’m wondering what he expected from me after sending this text. Does he think I would get involved with him romantically? Did he think I wanted to hear this? WTF? I have told him my stance on people cheating and how I do not condone that kind of behavior. Since we work together so closely (we are both upper management), how do I handle this? What do I say? Here is the text (since I can’t post screenshots to this forum):

5 years.  For the past 5 years, since a day that we had a lunch at Buffalo Wild Wings, I have not been able to get you off my mind.  It was really bad about 2 years ago when I would have given up everything I had just to have dinner with you, but I find that recently, it is happening again.  To wake up in the middle of the night thinking about you is both confusing and exciting.  I'm pretty sure none of this will come as a  shock to you but I'm telling you because I have needed to get it off my chest for years now and I know I need to stop before it causes any issues at work. I'm always comfortable telling you anything and since I won't be seeing as much of you as in the past now that we are downstairs, I thought I would end the year by letting you know.  Your sense of humor, confidence, strength, independence, motivation, risk taking, etc. makes it hard for me to hold in telling you how beautiful I find you every time I see you.  Every day there is something different that has me realizing just how special you are.

1od1thu,relationship_advice,My (30M) best man (31M) stole my wife (30F) and I think he’s back to take my girlfriend (29F),"Six years ago I (30M) was getting married. My best friend (31M) Judas, fake names to protect identities, was my best man. I was getting married to Leah (30F). 

Our friend group was very very close, there were 8/9 of us, and we always did everything together, days out, game nights, holidays etc. anytime a friend would bring another female friend into the group Judas would end up hooking up with them, as he was genuinely just naturally very funny and charismatic, which is a big part as to why he’s everyone’s best man, but he was never a threat to our relationships because we were all such good friends. 

Just over a year into our marriage, Leah and I start having issues, I’m in the army so I’m at camp through the week, returning home Friday evenings and leaving again early Monday mornings. This meant we only really got weekends together and I’d always want to spend them with the group, and she’d mostly want alone time, just the two of us, as she will have seen the group through the week. This amongst other things caused a lot of arguments and we ended up separating. 

While all this was going on two of our friends; Judas’ cousin Andrew (29M), and his fiancé Phoebe (29F), were a three days away from their wedding day (Judas of course being his best man too) when Andrew confessed to Phoebe that he had been cheating on her with a coworker for 6 months, so could not go ahead with the wedding. On what would have been their wedding day, a couple of us went to Phoebe’s for drinks to take her mind off everything, and her and Judas slept together. (Worst best man ever). Those two had always been very close to be fair, but we were all very surprised finding out. They apparently drunkenly did it a few more times over the next month before deciding to end all that. 

While Leah and I were ‘separated’ I’d still be trying my best to resolve things and work it all out, but she was slowly getting less and less interested in the idea of us. I later found out this was because she was spending all her time with Judas. They had gotten into a relationship, and he was basically living in the house I was paying half the mortgage for. (Worst best man ever). When I found this out I angrily text him “you’re dead to me” to which he replied solely with an image of the word ‘goodbye’ highlighted on a ouija board. 

Naturally, Leah and I went through the whole divorce process, and her and Judas were happy in their relationship. Judas, Leah, and Andrew were all out of our little friend group. The rest of us went out to celebrate when the divorce had finalised, and Phoebe and I ended up hooking up. 

Fast forward to now; Phoebe and I have been in a relationship for 3 years now. Leah and Judas have split, she’s now with some other man, and he’s single. Andrew has gotten married, he actually made it to the altar this time, and yes, Judas was his best man, so who knows what’s going to happen down the line with the worst best man, and Andrew’s new wife. 

Yesterday I wanted to surprise Phoebe, I set off to camp early Monday morning like I always do, except I’ve booked this week off in secret. I waited for her to go to work and then I came back to decorate the bedroom with flowers, her favourite chocolates etc. I park my car a block away so she doesn’t know I’m home. When she comes home, I surprise her, but I see that she’s on FaceTime, I’m 90% sure the face I see is Judas’ but she very quickly ends the call. Early in our relationship she drunkenly confessed to me that she thought her and Judas would’ve ended up together after what would’ve been her wedding night, and that she was sad when he ended up calling that off for Leah. So my heart sank. She told me it was just her brother on the phone, but I don’t believe her. 

I had also surprised her with a trip to Disney land, she’s always wanted to go, in the near future, where I had planned to propose, but now I’m unsure if I should go through with this, if Judas has managed to worm his way back into her life. I need help, I don’t know what to do. I’ve been at my parents awake all night, and I’m dreading going back home to have a conversation.

Do I confront her on this? Or go ahead with the planned trip and proposal and feign ignorance for a happier life? 

I’m sorry this is so long, I have left it as short as I could, there’s six years worth of drama I’ve tried to condense. 

TLDR: my worst best man got into a relationship with my wife while we were separated, and ultimately divorced, my current girlfriend confessed to having feelings for that best man in the past, and now he has resurfaced into her life, just as I was preparing to propose ",3397,0.89,3397,0,3876.0,479.0,1128,1761118459.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1od1thu/my_30m_best_man_31m_stole_my_wife_30f_and_i_think/,False,True

1m2sa0h,relationship_advice,I (F51) can't understand how husband (M53) forgot affair,"I, F51, have been married to my husband, M53, for 30 years. 20 or so years ago he had an emotional affair with a woman he met online. I discovered the affair after she contacted me when he attempted to break it off (after six months of fairly explicit messages back and forth). When I asked him about it at the time, he admitted everything. We worked through it with couples counseling. I honestly haven’t thought about it much in years and I haven’t brought it up outside of counseling ever.

Recently, our niece came to stay with us after her husband was having an ""emotional affair"" with a coworker. My husband was incensed on her behalf (as am I), but then said no good man would ever do that to his wife. I just sort of stared at him. He asked why and I reminded him that he did that to me. He looked legitimately confused. He eventually put the pieces back together after arguing with me about it for 30 minutes. I mean, I know we are getting older, but he's otherwise cognitively sharp. 

Could he really have forgotten? It was the worst time of my life. The hardest thing I have done in my 51 years was choose to forgive him. I'm hurt, but it doesn't seem fair to be hurt over something so long buried.

TLDR: Husband forgot he had an emotional affair and I'm hurt that he doesn't recall such a painful time in our lives.

How do I give this back and explain it to my parents?,"Before anyone says anything, yes I am aware we have an age difference. She’s a great woman and she makes a lot of money, like I think she might even be making 7+ figures a year. I met her doing handyman work for her snd things escalated into FWB. 

She started giving me a few extra dollars for keeping her company and the amounts just got bigger. Then she started buying me jewelry and such and I’ve tried to return these things, but she says she’s grateful for me keeping her company and making her feel good since she has no family and doesn’t get attention from men.

We see each other multiple days of the week and usually at the end of the week she gives me extra money and buys me stuff for the holidays. Like I said I don’t like taking the gifts, but she insists. Anyways my birthday was last week and she got me a brand new motorcycle. She got me the one I wanted paid off and said she is going to give me the title once she gets it in the mail.

I really told her I couldn’t take it as it is almost a $20,000 bike, but she told me she knows I’ve been saving up and working hard for it anyways.

1mk89z6,relationship_advice,My (25f) boyfriend (27m) called me selfish for wanting him to leave his boy's night early due to me grieving. Where do I go from here?,"I have tried posting this too many times lol. 

I've never used Reddit before, only seen videos, but I'm hoping to get some much needed insight. I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 4 years. Our relationship has been very good for the most part, some fights here and there but nothing worth noting; until a week ago.

I got a call from my brother telling me my mom had passed away last Friday. Growing up, I was never super close with her (we were usually fighting), but over the last 5 years our relationship improved tremendously. We'd text throughout the week, and every Sunday I would go on 4-5 hour drives with her on speaker to keep me company, talking about anything and everything under the sun. She became my best friend. For context, my boyfriend knows how close we had gotten and had even joined me for some of those drives. 

Now is the problem. My boyfriend has a fairly close group of friends that he keeps up with, usually gaming with them throughout the week. Then, once a month, him and his friends will hang out and drink. He let me know a few days prior that he would be hanging out with them that Friday.

When I got the news, I immediately called him, breaking down and telling him I didn't know what to do and that I knew I needed to be with him tonight. He went from consoling me to saying, ""I let you know a few days ago I have plans with my friends, I only get to see them once a month."" I told him I understood, but I really needed him and I'm sure they would reschedule, to which he said they definitely wouldn't be able to as they all have their own responsibilities. After some more time going back and forth, I gave in and said I would be okay with him going as long as he left early. Since he leaves at 7pm, I said I would like for him to come back by 11. He agreed.

I spent the night going through texts with her, photos, everything I could. I tried to distract myself with other things but nothing worked. Eventually, 10pm rolls around and I text my boyfriend, ""Will you be leaving in an hour?"" to which he responds, ""You told me 12, so I'll be leaving then."" I told him I said 11 and I was standing by that. He didn't respond after, and came home at 12. I asked him why he didn't reply and why he didn't just come back an hour earlier. He immediately got upset with me, telling me I was being selfish for ruining his night with his friends, him spending an extra hour there means nothing since he still left early, and I would be fine since I ""didn't spend my childhood with her anyways."" I told him I didn't even want him to go out with them that day to begin with since I had just gotten the news but I agreed to it under that specific condition, and so had he. He could also just catch up with his friends when they game during the week. The fight ended with him telling me I was again being selfish as he doesn't get to see them in person often, and that I shouldn't expect him to drop everything for me. 

We've been fairly cold to each other since which has left me overthinking and reevaluating our relationship. On one hand, I am extremely heartbroken he wasn't there for me and know that's not something I want for my future, but on the other hand, his words have definitely gotten to me and I feel bad for separating him from his friends. I also know it would break me more to lose someone else so close to me. Where do I go from here?

1hno7fc,relationship_advice,I accidentally saw a text on my (28M) girlfriend (29F) computer saying that she feels she’s out of my league. I feel like I have to break up with her?,"TLDR: Went to help gf with presentation, accidentally found a convo between her and her sister where my gf said she’s out of my league, unambitious, eat like shit, would never want kids with me even if we did want them (we don’t) and would resent me for making less money than her

I’ve been with my girlfriend for around 3 years, everything has been pretty good overall. This happened a few weeks ago so I’ve had time to think on it. My girlfriend had an opportunity to go on a free sunset cruise (fancy dinner, drinks etc) with some coworkers but had a presentation due that night which needed a bit of work, so I said I’d do it so she could go. Turns out it needed a bit more work than I thought. I was on her macbook and I want to send it to myself to work on the desktop (windows) so I can be more comfortable. So I open messages, can’t find my name in the recent convos, and just type it in the search bar. When you do that on a Mac it turns out that it’ll show the contacts (if you search a name) and also show the most recent conversations where the search term (my name) was mentioned. Right before I click my name I notice a message from her sister that says “I like (op) a lot but I feel like you are very much out of his league and he should try harder to be a better man for you“, so I open it (may be shitty I know) to which my gf responded “I agree”. I read their convo, nothing more, and she went on to say that she thinks I’m unambitious, “eat like shit”, “will resent me for making less than her” and that she ”wouldn’t want kids with (me) even if she(gf) did want kids”. She said that I was the one thing keeping her happy though. This was said during a fight over her never being willing to visit me 1hr away and leaving me to do all the traveling, but then saying she was going to fly 6hrs one way to visit her male friend (only context given) for literally one day. She’d fly in at night, spend one day together, then fly back the following day. It turned into a fight because she was willing to fly 12hr round trip and spend hundreds of dollars on a flight (and we both have no money because we’re students so it’s a big deal) but wouldn’t travel 1hr away to visit me for an entire weekend. Just to clarify, she didn’t end up going because I thought it was suspicious, we got in a fight and during/after the fight the convo took place. 

I’d agree that she probably is out of my league, and she will almost definitely make more money than me, but we both will have doctoral degrees and I expect to make ~120-130k and she’ll probably make ~250-300k, so there is an income disparity but it’s not like I’m not making good money regardless. I don’t think I eat that bad, and I’m slim (low end of normal bmi) so I don’t think I’m completely out of touch there but definitely not eating salmon and steak every night. There was no mistreatment on either end. I try to do nice things with and for her within the means of my $0 student salary and her parents like me. I just think she doesn’t like me 

I almost feel dumb for asking but, I’d be a fool if I didn’t break up with her, right? 

Update: yeah we’re done. sorry it wasn’t the dramatic ending some may have been looking for, but I did bring up what I saw, she cried and said she didn’t mean it etc and that was about it. Thanks for the people reminding me I’m a catch because it seems like I forgot that for a bit ;) but I’ll probably wait a bit before dating again so I won’t be able to see how true that is for a lil while 

Small edits/clarification: she didn’t go on the 12hr round trip flights because I called her out, she cheated in the past but not on me (that I know of), and for people saying I’m “cooked” or things like that for waiting this long, I had very important tests to take so I didn’t want the additional drama until they were over so it’s not like I read it and was gonna let it slide",3333,0.96,3333,0,3478.0,145.0,664,1735331601.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hno7fc/i_accidentally_saw_a_text_on_my_28m_girlfriend/,False,True
1ju7shc,relationship_advice,My (23f) boyfriend’s (26m) ex-girlfriend (26f) is creating TikTok videos about me. What can I do?,"My boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend broke up about a year and a half ago. She has a substantial following on TikTok and frequently posts about her journey of moving on from him and her new relationship. A few months ago, she began browsing my TikTok profile and inquiring about me through mutual followers. She requested to follow me on TikTok, and I accepted her request, subsequently following her back.

About a month ago, she posted a TikTok video claiming to have broken her leg and required surgery.

I work in the healthcare field at our local hospital. For some reason, she believes that I provided medical care to her while she was undergoing treatment for her leg. In one of her videos, she mentions that the surgery was performed at an outpatient surgical center that I am not affiliated with.

Last week, she posted two more TikTok videos alleging that I violated HIPAA by sharing her medical information. She claims that I took advantage of her while she was under anesthesia. She also mentioned that she reported this incident to the management of the surgical center, and they are currently investigating the matter.

I am concerned about the potential consequences for my medical license. I was not involved in her care and am not employed by the surgical center. I reported the videos on TikTok, but they stated that they did not violate any community guidelines.

Our mutual friends are aware of the situation and the fact that she is making the videos about me. She had previously blocked me before posting these videos.  I know that I did nothing wrong, but the fact that multiple people know she’s talking about me is worrisome. 

She has a long history of mental illness, including schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. Despite this, she still reaches out to my boyfriend because they had pets together, and she can’t afford their vet bills.

1o3dteg,relationship_advice,I (F30) just got a hey girl text and been told my husband (M 31) has been cheating on me 2 weeks after our marriage. I’m devastated.,"What am I even supposed to do? 

I’m out of town and got a follow request both on FB and Instagram from a girl. I get a few of these regularly but with that one I somehow had some weird gut feeling and started to shake.

Instead of accepting her request I messaged her if we know each other to which she replied we dont and she gets it might be awkward but she would like to discuss something with me in person asap. 

Since I’m out of town and she is a complete stranger, I said let’s discuss online and she said it’s about my husband. I immediately knew that the worst is coming. 

She said that he is cheating on me and I deserve better. Said that it’s not continuing anymore as he broke up with her today. However, she told me it start few months ago when they met online at first and then met in person. She knew he was married - he told her. 

She was asking why is he cheating and why he got married in the place to which he replied that he felt pressure from the others (we’ve kinda been together for 10 years when he proposed). And that marriage is just a big expensive party and nothing more than a piece of paper. 

Then I asked her why they broke up then and she told be because he is basically happy in our relationship and he doesn’t want to risk it anymore. 

She said he was visiting her at her place when I was coming late from work and even had sleepovers when I was out of town. 

I told her not to tell him that I know and I’m about confront him in person once I’m back home. 

We’ve been married for 5 months, he basically started to cheat right after, still telling me loves me etc. I feel so betrayed. I thought I found my person and now it’s all gone and I feel like I’m getting back to square one in life. I told him I want to start a family next year.


I have no idea what to do after I tell him I know everything. I can’t even cry, just have this hollow in my chest and feeling numbness. 

I also have no idea why she told me now and not sooner. 

EDIT as Im not sure if you can find this comment:

“Thanks everyone for your comments, support and kind words. This is my first post so I’m not even sure if I should add this as an “edit” part or if you’re gonna see this comment either way.

I was wide awake whole night, reading everything, chatting with some of you in DMs.

I already had a scheduled message for her, saying that “I was thinking of you told me yesterday and the only thing I’m missing in all this is an evidence, as it’s a big accusation and words against words”. However I decided not to send it yet. Firstly, at the moment I’m not able to handle seeing any proof/evidence with my own eyes. I just can’t face this yet and I don’t wanna know detail. I never wanted her to reach out to me and throw her burden on me instead of carrying it herself.

Secondly, I know my husband (to some point at least). Believe it or not it, he is kinda sensitive and caring person. I know once I drop it even without evidence, he ain’t gonna gaslight me and he will admit. If he would be saying it’s not true, then I will demand to show me his stuff or I reach out to her. But talking to her brings me anger and anxiety at this point.

He will be asking me how my weekend at my parents was. I will tell him I met some childhood friends and actually made a new friend! And that he wouldn’t believe what happened to her - she found a married guy she was supposed to spend her weekend with when his wife was traveling but he broke up with her instead. So she decided to tell his wife. Plot twist - you’re the guy, I’m the wife and my friend is name of the girl who reach out to me. Then I will wait for him to process and I’ll start to have a conversation.

We know each other since my 16 and his 17. I considered this man by best friend. I was just re-reading the vow he wrote me and thinking of past few months how there was nothing wrong basically. He didn’t give me any bigger clue to worry about anything. He even bought me flowers last week just like that.

I don’t know what I’ll do yet. It’s also up to him and how he approaches this whole situation. I know that to majority of you I will look like a naive and stupid, not learning my lesson. But for me the marriage is something so sacred and something I wanted with him since the day one that is difficult for me to let it go without trying any counseling. Maybe the end is inevitable and I’m just prolonging something that will come but I can’t see myself making any decision in this state of mind.

Once again, thank you everyone. You are such a great people and I’m sorry if you had to go through something like that yourself. No one deserves this kind of betrayal.

I will let you know how it went once I talk to him tomorrow evening. So far Im playing “everything is okay” card so he has no suspicions.

Edit: I have a therapy session booked on Monday evening

Edit 2: She just reached out to me that if I want we can still meet in person and she can show me conversations they had (I that what I saw in a pop-up window as she texted on Instagram again and I didnt open the message yet)”

1i8jjo2,relationship_advice,Husband (26M) told me he'll never get on a plane despite knowing and accepting I (26F) have always wanted to live in Japan. How do I move on from this?," I've been with my husband for 4 years now. We married last year in October. Our entire relationship, he has known I've been studying Japanese and that I want to move to Japan to teach English. I've been working with tutors for 3 years to learn the language and was planning to start the process of getting a TEFL certificate (Teach English as a Foreign Language). I started looking into programs I could work with for after I get this certificate and talking to him more seriously about where I specifically would like to move to. He's never been out of state before, but has talked about wanting to travel and said he would love to live in Japan. All of the sudden, he just looks at me and asks if we're going to have to have a long-distance relationship. I obviously asked what he meant by that, and he goes on to tell me he's afraid of planes and he could never go to Japan because of it. That I would have to go there by myself and come back regularly to see him. I have no idea why he didn't say anything like this earlier. He knew from the start this is what I always wanted, and now he's saying he thought I was just going to teach online? That he didn't realize I actually wanted to live there? I don't know what to do. I don't feel like this is something leave him over, but this is something I've wanted to do since I was 11-years-old. My parents never supported the idea and so I had to wait until I was financially independent and stable enough to start formally learning everything. I've put a lot of my time and money into this dream.  It was finally within sight, but he won't budge. He just keeps shooting it down whenever I try to come up with a way for us to move there. He says it's useless to even try... I don't know what to do.



Edit to answer some questions and comments:

  
 Biggest one is that the plan never was to move to Japan permanently. We talked, in depth, about going there for 6 months to a year at first, depending on what is offered to me when I apply, and then coming back for a year or two before doing it again. It was not one-sided conversations. He even said it would make for great experiences for our children when we have them and thought it would be so cool if our kids could speak Japanese. I've tried many times to get him to learn the language properly, yet he always insisted I could just translate for him. He knows very basic phrases and I have yet to get him to learn more. I know I was vague, but I didn't think people would assume we didn't have proper conversations about it. Even during the conversation where he was telling me it's useless to look for solutions, he was saying he wished he could go.

  
 He has mentioned he doesn't like planes before, but never went in depth to what extent he doesn't like them. We did talk about taking a boat a few times while discussing getting there. The conversation always seemed like the answer was that we'll feel it out when the time comes to actually make a decision, not him giving a solid no to either. I very much dislike boats and water in general, but I'm 100% willing to go on a boat if it means we go together.

  
 Yes, he has anger issues. I know people will say it is not my job, but I have been working with him to try to get it under control. I am so tired from working and studying, though, that I've been ignoring him when he's angry until he cools down to come talk to me rather than working through it with him lately.

  
 Many people have asked how he would even come with me and what would he do while there. We were looking specifically into a dependent visa for him. If I were to get a working visa, I should be able to sponsor him since we're married. As for work, he does freelance graphic design online. He can work anywhere. I hate my job and don't mind having to find a different one when we come back.

  
 Some people mentioned it would be social suicide for him and that I'd be removing him from all he knows. He moved to the other side of the state, away from friends and family, less than a year before we met. He doesn't talk to his family often, and we only see them once a year. In the four years we've been living together, he has had a friend visit maybe 3 times. Most of his friends are online, and so there would be little change for him in that aspect.

  
 I am not clueless about Japan. I have some Japanese friends online and one friend that I grew up with who has been to Japan many times. Everyone I have ever personally known who has gone to Japan has said it is absolutely worth it. Two of my coworkers lived in Japan for several years, got married, and they and their spouses often go back to Japan. I know it's not going to be all rainbows and butterflies. Someone also mentioned something about anime. That's not what fueled my desire. I took a world languages class when I was 11, was praised for grasping the languages so well, and got super cocky. I thought I was going to be able to learn every single language, go all over the world, and be super rich just by being able to speak multiple languages. I very quickly learned languages are hard, but it didn't stop me from still wanting to learn. I self-studied a much smaller amount of languages for a few years after that before finally deciding to focus on one at a time. My ultimate goal is to be conversational in 3 foreign languages before I croak, and I would love to be able to visit/live in the countries of those languages for a bit as well. Japanese/Japan just ended up being the one I found most interesting. Someone will probably say I don't have to defend myself, but I hate when I tell someone that I'm studying Japanese, and they just spew phrases in an Anime voice at me. No disrespect to Anime, it's just not the reason I want to learn the language and live in Japan. They're cartoons; I know life isn't a cartoon.

  
 It is getting hard to keep track of all the comments and questions. I'll try to go through them better and answer what I see, but I cannot guarantee I will see everything. I would really like to not give out too much information. It may be irrational, but I don't want anyone I know seeing it and possibly connecting it to me or anything like that.

  
 I plan to sit him down and try to have a much better structured conversation about it either tonight or tomorrow. I originally wrote this post not too long after our conversation and was, obviously, very upset. I guess I was looking for people to share similar experiences and help me navigate through this. I hope to find out why he went from what I perceived to be excited about the whole plan to telling he's terrified of planes (And I guess travel in general, as many have pointed out) and that he'll never go. I will update when I can. Thank you to those who were kind and gave actual advice, and thank you to those who showed concern. I am still a bit angry, but maybe we can talk this through, and things will work out. I also talked to my friend about it and he said he would go to Japan with me if I don't want to go alone so I can still go see it when I'm ready to!

1jkttu7,relationship_advice,"My (M30) younger brother's (M28) girlfriend (F25) said something that made me (and everyone else in the room) super uncomfortable. It's been months and it's still a problem, how do I get everyone to move past this?","UPDATE: Met with John: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1jni07c/update\_my\_m30\_younger\_brothers\_m28\_girlfriend\_f25/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jni07c/update_my_m30_younger_brothers_m28_girlfriend_f25/)

So, some background: my brother (We'll call him John) and I are very different people and always have been. I'm a nerdy guy who like playing Dungeons and Dragons and works from home coding websites, he's always been sporty and has one of those corporate office jobs where I swear half of his work is just playing golf and going to fancy lunches. We didn't always get along but we're pretty good these days.

He started dating his girlfriend, who we'll call Jane, a few years back during what was a pretty low point for me in life. I had just gotten out of a long term relationship that had ended anything but amicably, was burning out of the career I went to college for, and in general was about two paychecks away from having to move in with my folks. The stress of it all was taking a toll on my body, I went from the ""lightly chubby"" I'd been my whole life to just straight up fat and shortly after the breakup I had an anxiety attack so bad it put me in the hospital. It was not a good time to get to know me, I was basically the picture of a fuck-up older brother.

But I turned it around. I got the mental health assistance I needed to diagnose and treat some longstanding issues. With that as a springboard, I started exercising more and eating better, finding cooking to be a good hobby that also lead to me eating less takeout and processed foods. I'm still no Adonis, still got a bit of a tummy, but I'm much stronger and feel better. I was able to quit my  job and find a new one in a field that I never considered but that I found I loved enough that I'm going back to school to work on a PhD in the fall so I can pursue it to a greater extent. And finally, I started dating again, someone (we'll call her Flo) who was a better match for me than my ex.

Which all brings us to the night things went wrong. We have a family gathering at my parent's house, extended family and all plus Jane and Flo. I'm making dinner, a beef wellington. Everyone is raving about my food (I also did dinner this past Thanksgiving as well) and also my recent glowup, my new job, the program I got into, etc. I'm smiling politely and mostly just trying to do a bunch of dinner prep while they won't get out of my way. Then Jane says ""Yeah, never thought I'd picked the wrong brother, but I'm starting to think I might've.""

You could hear a pin drop. I said nothing, again, just awkwardly laughed at what I assumed to have been a bad joke. Jane's face immediately changed to the look of someone who has only just realized their fuckup. John looked pissed, and the two of them left the kitchen shortly after. From what I could see, she seemed to be trying to apologize to him while he looked really hurt. My relatives said nothing, not immediately anyway. Flo kind of just winced, and later told me that it was really awkward having to stand there but she didn't know what else to do that wouldn't have escalated things or put me on the spot.

That was over two months ago, and both John and Jane avoid me like the plague. Not even a text since then. Whenever I meet up with my relatives they bad-mouth her over it, and while I think Jane did fuck up saying that I really do think she was just making a bad joke. Personally, I think they're overreacting. This aside, I think she's probably the first person he's ever dated who was a fit for him in terms of personality and lifestyle. The only person being normal about it is Flo, who thinks it was weird but like me just a dumb thing to say (no jealousy, she knows Jane ain't my type).

How do I clear the air with Jane and John and get people to stop bringing this up? I'm sick of hearing about it and just want things to go back to how they were before. Right now it just feels like a dark cloud over all of our interactions.

UPDATE: Messaged John. Grabbing a beer over the weekend. Will update later. In the meantime, some clarifying info for some of the other comments:

Jane is a very nice person and she really cares for John. She's been with him through some difficult times, including a period where work separated the two of them for three months, and they're otherwise attached at the hip. She does have what some call a lack of filter, we've known that for a while. But she'd absolutely never leave him for me.

For why my relatives won’t let it go, probably because they’re a bunch of old Italian Catholics who like to gossip. Which, incidentally, is probably why they didn’t like the joke in the first place.

My brother and I have a pretty good relationship as adults and aren’t especially competitive. My folks and relatives don’t favor one of us over the other, though admittedly they do understand my brother’s career path better than mine.

I agree with a number of comments that the impetus of the joke was that I’m a good cook especially, when it comes to be celebratory feasts. John is okay in the kitchen, but he’s the kind of guy for whom a fancy meal just means picking up a more expensive cut of steak.

I really don’t think it has anything to do with me being “the hot brother” now as a few comments suggested. John and I have always looked very different, comparing us would be more a matter of personal preference than any kind of objective hotness scale. He’s tall with a runner’s build and I’m a few inches shorter with a wide build and more visible muscles as weightlifting is my main form of exercise. Lastly, not to toot my own horn but I’ve never had any issues getting dates barring the aforementioned year-long period where my life was falling apart, so I must have been doing something right.

Lastly, as some have said I probably could’ve saved everyone some awkwardness by playing along with Jane’s comment with a “sorry, Flo got to me first” or something else similar. I go into what Flo dramatically calls “The Kitchen Death Drive” while cooking complicated meals, where I’m laser-focused on the task at hand to the exclusion of all else and my responses to questions tend to be short, curt, and even a bit rude. Normally I would’ve tried to help salvage the bad joke but I was searing a big expensive piece of tenderloin at the moment so my thoughts were elsewhere.",3305,0.97,3305,0,3410.0,105.0,198,1743042906.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jkttu7/my_m30_younger_brothers_m28_girlfriend_f25_said/,False,True
1kcdbu5,relationship_advice,I (29M) was warned not to marry my girlfriend (28F) by her best friend. What now?,"I've been with my girlfriend for three years, and I’ve been planning to propose in the next couple of months. Recently, we had a group of her friends over, and I decided to share my plans with one of her best friends.

For context, her best friend is a gay man who’s been in a committed relationship for eight years. Their relationship seems stable, and while they’re not married, they treat it as if they are. He’s also very blunt. He tends to speak his mind even when it causes tension, and he's not great at sugarcoating things to avoid awkwardness.

So, when I told him about my plan to propose, he looked a bit uncomfortable. He said, “...good luck,” while glancing around like he wanted to leave. His reaction surprised me, so I asked if he had any tips or if there was something he wanted to get off his chest about me. He said he actually likes me and enjoys spending time with me, which made the situation more confusing. I asked him directly what was bothering him, thinking I could handle whatever he said.

That’s when he told me he had concerns, not about me, but about my girlfriend. According to him, she has a pattern of being emotionally distant in relationships. He said she’s dated people more for convenience than genuine affection and that she only ever seemed truly excited about one guy in the past. Her excitement then was as simple as being eager to text him back or lighting up when he messaged her. He also pointed out that she still talks about her exes a lot, even though she doesn’t keep in touch with them. I’ve noticed this too. She’ll bring up old conversations with exes and talk about them in surprising detail.

He also mentioned that she hasn’t been single for more than a year since before high school. While he admitted that might be hypocritical, since he’s been with his boyfriend since high school, he said he believes she sometimes confuses romantic relationships with emotional support systems. That hit home for me because during our first year together, I actually wondered if she was in love with him. I eventually dropped that thought after spending more time around him and realizing how committed he is to his boyfriend and quite frankly he is very gay. But the behaviors that raised my suspicions, her emotional dependence on him, only stopped after he established stronger boundaries.

I remember a year into our relationship my girlfriend got upset that he stopped coming over to comfort her after his boyfriend moved in full-time. They had an argument, and he apparently admitted that her lack of boundaries was part of the reason he pulled back. Sometimes she would even sleep over at his place, which always struck me as odd. Those were the kinds of things I thought I should be doing as her partner. What surprised me is that she’s never been overly clingy with me. If anything, she’s independent and sometimes distant. But with him, she had a strong emotional reliance.

What started as me sharing exciting news turned into a conversation that left me feeling uncertain. I love my girlfriend, but her friend made some valid points that are now weighing on me. His comments echoed some things I had noticed but hadn’t fully processed.

Now I’m left wondering, why would he bring all this up? Was he trying to protect me, or was this crossing a line? Do I talk to my girlfriend about this? If I do, and she finds out what he said, what does that mean for their friendship, or for mine with her? Does she have a right to know her friend shared this with me?

TL;DR I told my girlfriend’s best friend I was planning to propose. He reacted awkwardly and eventually shared concerns about her emotional patterns in past relationships like being distant, dating for convenience, and relying heavily on him for support. His comments made me question things I had noticed too. Now I’m unsure if I should talk to her about it, and I’m conflicted about whether she should know what her friend said.",3303,0.97,3303,0,3408.0,105.0,404,1746117707.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kcdbu5/i_29m_was_warned_not_to_marry_my_girlfriend_28f/,False,True
1hc3vvh,relationship_advice,I think my (28F) partner (30M) of 10 years might have abandoned me and our baby?,"I don’t even really know what to say. Thank you in advance to whoever reads this. I don’t know what to think or do anymore, I feel completely heartbroken and confused and really need some advice and empathy. 

To start, my fiancé wanted a family. We bought a house together a few years ago, but only his name went on the title because most of the downpayment came from his RRSP. This made me a bit uncomfortable but we were planning to get married after saving a bit more so i agreed. I paid all our moving costs and furnished the entire house, so we both spent about the same. 

We had our daughter last November, a planned child he claimed to have wanted. When I was pregnant, he suddenly started gambling, something he’d never done before. He gambled away a few of his paycheques and finally after a month I managed to get him to agree to give me control of his account. 

I give birth. When I’m 4 weeks postpartum, he claims to get the flu and spends an entire month at his parents house to avoid infecting the baby. I thought he’d be there for a few days at most. 

He returns. In March, he claims there’s a giant work project that he needs to throw his all into. He works from home and since I was on an unpaid mat leave (self employed) he was the breadwinner. 

He stops speaking to me, claiming he’s so busy with work and he’s so stressed that he doesn’t even have time to say hi to me in the morning. However, he’s awake all night and sleeping in during the day. Around the same time, HR calls me and says he hasn’t logged on in a few days and they send a wellness check. 

Eventually, after a month and a half of not speaking to me, eating alone in his room, ignoring the baby completely, he demands his bank account back. I have no choice but to give him his card but I was hoping he wouldn’t lock me out of the account. He does. He then gambles again. 

I decide to go down to my parents house for a few days after he rages out at me when I try to talk to him. He basically stops responding to my texts except to tell me to fuck off and that he’s depressed. 

He responds some of the time, saying he’s trying to get therapy and saying I can’t come back home until he talks to a therapist. This entire time I am stressed knowing he’s probably gambling and not paying the mortgage or bills. 

This continues through June, July, August. He refuses to speak with me, I plead and beg him to talk to me. Finally in September he tells me he’s behind on the mortgage and needs money. I send him the money. He thanked me at first and says I’ll be able to come home soon - at this point he would barely let me in the house to get mine or our baby’s things, screaming and freaking out the few times I showed up. 

He stops speaking to me again, only responding to tell me to fuck off and stop contacting him. At certain points he tells me he loves me and wants me and the baby to come home soon, but he needed to get through therapy first. 

This brings me to the present. Just before our daughter’s first birthday, he blocked my number and blocked me on Facebook. I have been begging and pleading with him to tell me what’s going on, to tell me SOMETHING and nothing. 

We have four cats that he wouldn’t let me come and get. I own all the furniture and so many belongings in the house and I have no idea if the mortgage company is going to just repo and trash it all. I have no idea if my beloved cats are okay. I don’t even know if we are together anymore. 

I have tried to get his parents to talk to him, they’re in contact with him and gave him money for the mortgage back payments. They just say they don’t know and that he won’t talk to them about this. 

I was at my parents house and now I’m staying in my brothers basement. I feel like I’ve lost everything. I don’t know what happened. 

————————
EDIT: 

Thank you so much for all of the kind comments. I have felt so alone and just getting this out helped a lot. I have been so depressed over this situation that I feel like I can barely breathe most days. 

I think I’ve been in denial, like this CANT be actually happening to me and that one day I’m going to wake up to his heartfelt apology and all the bills fixed and go back to my beautiful house. 

It was our dream home and we got it for such a deal. Beautiful historic home, six bedrooms, original features, huge yard with amazing 100 year old trees all through the neighborhood. It was the neighborhood I grew up dreaming about living in someday. 

To know I’ll never be able to afford a house on my own and that I have no idea where my daughter will grow up…. It is just killing me. I grew up so poor and thought I had finally made it and would be able to give my baby a good life. 

To just be blocked with no answers.. for him to be losing the house and not even give me a chance to take it over for our daughters sake. He doesn’t even know where I’m living right now. I slept on the floor for two months when this first started. 

I thought we were soulmates.

I wanted to post an update for everyone who gave me advice in my previous posts and helped me through a really difficult time. 

My soon-to-be-ex-husband has been gone from our home for 2 weeks now. It has been two weeks filled with crash outs, love bombing and everything in between. But I have held firm and told him I am completely out of the relationship and want a divorce. 

I have bought new security cameras for the time being, but want to sell our house and buy my own place as soon as possible. But separating our finances is going to be so difficult. 

I know I’m only at the very beginning of the journey, but I am feeling so proud of myself and strong in my resolution. And honestly, I haven’t even missed him once yet. I feel free. The kids and I can be at home and do what we feel like without worrying if he will have a problem with it. There’s no more yelling at home. It’s just peaceful. 

So thank you again for your advice. I probably won’t have another update, but thank you all and if you have any tips or tricks for negotiating custody agreements and divorce that would be great.

1htjt46,relationship_advice,My girlfriend (27f) is expecting her name on the deed to a house that I (28m) will be using my money to buy?,"I have been with my partner for over 3 years and we've said in the next 5 years it would be nice if we had enough for a deposit for a house. Last month I inherited a pretty substantial amount of money which will allow me to buy a house outright.

I was talking about this with my partner and mentioned to her that I could do this but that since I would be the one paying for the house that I would only be putting my name as a homeowner. I said I don't expect her to pay rent obviously, I'd only expect her to contribute towards utilities and groceries.

She said I was being unfair since we were planning to buy a house together. I said that if she wants then I'm happy to wait until we both have the money then or I'm happy to pay the down payment then my gf can pay all of the mortgage until she matches the down payment. She said since I have the money now, it makes sense for us to get a house now since it would mean we're not paying rent anymore.

I told her that's fine with me but if we choose the option to buy sooner then I will be the sole homeowner. She again said I was being unfair since it should be both of us but I just pointed out that I'm the one paying for the house.

She just repeated that I was being unfair towards her and that we should both be on the deeds as homeowners.

How would you handle this?

Tl;dr I recently inherited a large sum of money. I mentioned to me gf the possibility of buying a house with it, I said the house would be in my name only. She got annoyed at this so I offered her multiple alternatives which she also turned down.

1o26jfu,relationship_advice,Wife (33F) cheated on me 34(M) with a woman (30F) while pregnant,"I’m devastated so I’ll keep this short. My wife came out to me last week. Our second daughter was born 3 months ago. She had been cheating for the majority of the pregnancy.

Ever since she told me, my wife has been posting on social media about her newfound sexuality and partner, and finally being able to live authentically and getting praised for her bravery. On top of that, her and her gf have been acting like parents on SM to our newborn and I only found out she (the gf) existed a week ago.

1ihjnpf,relationship_advice,My [50F] daughter [26F] abandoned her son again. How do I help comfort him?,"I've raised my daughter mostly as a single mom since my husband died of cancer when she was 6 years old. I took great care of her and taught her all the right lessons while enforcing discipline balanced with fun.

When she was 18 years old and still in high school, she became pregnant. I encouraged her to have an abortion as she wasn't ready to take of a child yet but she refused and it was her decision. When her son was born though, she kept complaining for a few months about him crying or him wanting attention. She even yelled at me and her son [now 8M] quite a few times.

When he was 6 months old, she just took off leaving a note saying that she was going to restart her life with a rich boyfriend she met online. I was devastated but decided to raise her son as if he were my own. He has truly been a blessing.

3 months ago, she called me for the first time in years and said she regretted her decision and wanted to reconnect. I made it clear that until she proved that she could be responsible, her child stays with me. 

Things started off well at first but within a few weeks, she went back to complaining and even not showing up to her son's school events. She again complained about how much attention she needs and I kept firmly reminding her she has a responsibility.

Yesterday though, she again left as we were sleeping and left another note saying she couldn't do this and was going to rebuild her life overseas. I told her son that she went to the hospital when the truth is that she abandoned me and her kid again.

1ny1ugx,relationship_advice,Girlfriend (36F) let me borrow her apple watch to track my (31M) heart rate for my anxiety. Turns out my heart rate only lowers when I’m not with her. What’s the path forward?,"So I have some anxiety. And since I met my gf earlier this year, it’s been worse. I had assumed it was just due to state of the world. She suggested I wear her Apple Watch to track my heart rate, and see what raises or lowers it. And unfortunately, it appears my anxiety is high when I’m with her, and only lowers when we’re apart. It’s nearly an exact match - if we’re hanging out for a day and she goes to the gym or get coffee with a friend, it lowers as soon as she’s gone and shoots right up when she texts me that she’s heading back.

After some contemplation, it makes sense. She’s quick to doubt our relationship - minor things like her spilling a drink can turn into an hours long conversation of “Do you still like me? Can you stand to be with me? Are you going to break up with me?” Even though I immediately respond to the spill with “don’t worry about it, I have paper towels and cheap furniture.” She’s a sensitive woman, and I love that about her as a sensitive person. But I’m always on edge, waiting for the next minor inconvenience to turn into a meltdown. And frankly, it can be tiring to again and again explain that it’s fine if she dies in Zelda, it’s a video game and literally doesn’t matter.

1hogbb9,relationship_advice,"My MIL (65f) asking for my (34F) wedding ring back twice ""you haven't had kids""","My husband (40m) and I (34f) have been married for 9 years. His family has been absolutely horrible for about 7 of those. Everyone is local to our area.

Readers digest: MIL (65f) used to be a real estate agent/RE firm manager. She helped my BIL and his affair (while his wife was pregnant with twins) secretly purchase a home, while lying to his wife. BIL then two-timed wife and mistress for 3 years, my MIL enabled and lied in wild ways to help him keep it secret (truly). 6 years ago, MIL was discovered to have committed wire fraud, escrow fraud, and possible embezzlement of $300,000+ from her real estate firm. IRS investigated and could not find evidence enough to charge her criminally for embezzlement, but MIL did lose her RE license permanently (her mom paid off the other crimes/settled outside of court). MIL has since been on the verge of a 3rd bankruptcy while trying to sell life insurance to pay her bills. My FIL (70m) is in terrible health.

MIL has told me ""you caused BIL to cheat - when you and husband got married, BIL lost his entire support and best friend"". We sat down and had a conversation with MIL and FIL about this and other issues. It was received but not really improved after.

Husband and I did marriage counseling 4 years ago to figure out how to save ourselves from this insanity. Decided to see them 2x a year, basically Easter and Christmas/Thxgiving at most. He's in therapy weekly now and recognizes the toxicity.

3 years ago on Christmas, we had MIL, FIL over for Christmas. MIL waited for my husband to leave the room, and asked for my heirloom wedding ring back. Husband overheard, came back in, and MIL stated it was because she ""wanted it to stay in the family with a grandchild, and we hadn't had kids."" We said absolutely not, that was my ring.

This year on Christmas, she asked for it AGAIN. Once again, claiming she wants to give it to our neice (3yo, product of the BIL affair) as we haven't had kids. My husband got angry and shut it down. (We should have just walked out.) MIL stated she wants it to stay in the family, my husband said ""we are family.""

I'm so over it. A pregnancy would be very high-risk for me, so this repeated issue is triggering, hurtful, frustrating. We've thought about fostering/adopting. My in-laws would not see that child as a 'true grandchild' (their issue).

When is enough enough? I'm tired of going to even 1 event per year and feeling emotionally abused at the end of it. I'm ready to go no-contact. I don't want to put my husband in a situation where he has to choose because I did. Our marriage is wonderful, but his family is just too much.

My boyfriend says they must forget, but is this normal, and how am I supposed to deal with it?","My boyfriend and I have been together for about nine months. He asked me a little while ago if I wanted to come to dinner at his family's house, a family thing. I said yes, but that I didn't want to be too much trouble because of my diet, so if it wouldn't be practical, I don't have to come and we could do something another time. He said it would be fine, and he'd tell his parents.

Because I'm Jewish, my whole family is, there are a lot of rules about what you can and can't eat. We can't eat dairy and meat together, we have to wait a certain time after eating one of them until we can eat the other, we can't eat anything with blood, and we can only eat certain animals, shellfish, pork, and some other meats aren't allowed. I'm not super strict, so I'm not very fussy about the particles, the rules about utensils, things like that.

Like the dairy and meat rules, and that we can't have things like pork. But I get it can be annoying for people who don't follow it, so I wasn't expecting to be able to eat most of the things. I didn't mind.

But I'm not even joking, there was bacon in literally everything. The potatoes, the salads, the meat, even some of the vegetables. And like, that was kind of embarrassing. My boyfriend asked why I wasn't eating, and I said I couldn't eat bacon. He said his mother must have forgotten. Which was fine, although kind of awkward, but you know, those things happen. So I let that go.

Then a few months later, he asked me to go to one of those things again. I said yes, I kind of thought I should, and I figured it couldn't be that bad. But the same thing happened again. My boyfriend said again that she must have forgotten. Annoying again. Then I was studying with my boyfriend at his house. And she offered us chocolate chip cookies, with bacon in them. And I just want to bang my head against a wall.

I don't get it, I really don't. Now I don't know the average American diet. But I just don't think it's normal to be putting bacon in everything. And it's making going to his house and seeing his family really awkward. And I don't want to be one of those people that makes everything catered to them and I don't want people to think I am, but it's really weird.

 Now, I could definitely be making this a bigger deal than it is, but I feel like if I was told that someone who was coming couldn't eat something, I wouldn't forget. I don't want to sound entitled, but it makes everything really awkward, and I feel embarrassed by it. It just seems like something so small to not do, and while I will say I've never eaten bacon so I don't know if it's really good and should be put in most things, but it just feels weird.

I've told my boyfriend this, and he said his mother must just forget. And I've said that if he wants me to see his family, if he could please try and do something to make sure he doesn't forget. I feel like I'm being annoying but it's really frustrating because it feels like every time, it ends up like this. I don't want to seem immature, and I just don't get what I'm supposed to do about it.",3183,0.92,3183,0,3486.0,303.0,1693,1750586463.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lhkcpi/it_feels_like_my_20f_boyfriends_21m_family_puts/,False,True
1jopv85,relationship_advice,My mum (60f) wants me to donate my egg (30f). How to save our relationship?,"My mum (60f) has been with her husband for about 15 years. She is almost 20y older than he is. She has 3 kids, a lot of health issues (heart and last year something similar to a stroke). He has no kids but really wants some. Recently she has shared that she is actively loosing weight to have another pregnancy. She has already tried ivf with her own frozen eggs and it didn't work out (thank God). Now she is asking for me to donate the egg. I am terrified.

I really dont want her to get pregnant bc

1. I am not comfortable with the idea of my biological kid not being with me
2. it most probably will kill her
3. idk what I should do with my child/sibling once she is gone in 10-15y
4. Her husband is very toxic, i dont want any kid to be around him, esp bio mine.

It is especially painful topic for me as a I had my first pregnancy last year and  due to complications had to tfmr. My mum is now actively tries to persuade me to postpone my attempts ""for your health reasons"" while pushing me to donate an egg. I know I won't. Question is how to communicate it. Also I am kind of mad at her for asking me this. What to do?

1m3v5ij,relationship_advice,"Update: My (24F) BF (27M) booked our tickets for a different day. I’m tired, frustrated and contemplating breaking up with him. What would you do in my place?","Hi everyone, not sure if this will get burried or not, but a few people asked for an update. 

First of, I want to thank everyone who gave me feedback in my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/ehnBl5FLP6
I’ve thought a lot about other people’s experiences and did a lot of self-reflection. 

Here’s the update to my previous post:
So, long story short - we broke up amicably.

For those, who want the longer version with a bit of recap of the entire situation:
I omited a lot of details and lied about our personal lives, just so I could get truly unbiased opinions. To tell the truth, I’m a med student, got into med school a bit later because well… life happened. He’s just finished law school. At the time of the concert, I had to study for my anatomy final and could not have any distractions, but I told myself that the concert would be a treat to myself during this tough time period. 

We had arrived at his friend’s place where we’d be staying and tbh I’ve never felt so unwelcomed and out of place in my entire life. Me, my bf (let’s call him Jim), his friend Jane and her bf John decided to go to a restaurant in the evening, and Jane basically didn’t acknowledge me for the entire evening. Every time Jim had to leave the table, Jane would turn to John and pretended I wasn’t there. I then heard her say that after dinner, she’d like to go get something cheap and sweet to eat, to which I proposed a certain shop in the city we were in. Jane replied that it smelled there. After asking her how did the shop smell, she looked me in the eyes, laughed and said it smelled like poor people. When Jim returned, I took him aside and told him what Jane has said to me, to which he just laughed. For the rest of the evening it was clear I was sticking out from the group, because the conversation topics were about things I had no knowledge about so I couldn’t participate in them. So I sat in silence until we came back to Jane’s flat. I then cried in the shower. I felt completely useless, like the evening would have gone exactly the same wether I was there or not.

The next day, the ticket incident happened. Jim checked the tickets and realised he booked them for the day before. I tried to get the tickets and was contacted by a scammer, and got scammed circa 80€ (already talked to police but they put the investigation on hold). 

During this time, Jim kept repeating how stupid he was and that he would fix everything (just didn’t know how). The artist won’t come to our country any time soon btw. Jim also never said how he would prevent similar mistakes from happening again.

After that, I didn’t speak to him for almost 2 weeks and took to reddit. In the end, I decided to give him one last chance, and said probably both of us should work on our communication. He said he didn’t expect me to give him another chance, didn’t know how to react - so he thought it over for 12+ hours and didn’t contact me. During this time, I kind of emotionally accepted he didn’t want to be with me anymore.

The next day Jim agreed to give it another try, but the excuses started. He kept telling me he would be jobless during the summer, money would be tight, we wouldn’t be able to travel anywhere, that I should enjoy my summer etc. To me, it sounded like he wanted an out, but didn’t want to be the bad guy and propose the break up.

Come to find out, he wasn’t as broke as he was telling me, because he attended a film and music festival. Doing the math, he probably spent around 300€. 

So I messaged him that I’m tired, he didn’t even say sorry after Jane insulted me, and I didn’t see him making any effort in planning our future and owning up to his mistakes. We wished each other well, we would be open to communication if we ever crossed paths again, and I now feel like somebody close to me died. Rationally I know I did the right thing, but I’ve never broken up with anyone amicably before, and grieving this relationship is extremely hard on me. 

Thank you all for reading. Take care.",3177,0.97,3177,0,3278.0,101.0,99,1752928464.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m3v5ij/update_my_24f_bf_27m_booked_our_tickets_for_a/,False,True
1jhx3yj,relationship_advice,"I (28M) am considering leaving my GF (29F) after she Catfished me ""as a prank""","Me &amp; my GF have been together for 2 years. I always thought she was very sweet and kind, and I really appreciate how much she loves me. And while she sometimes got a little jealous, I didn't think it was a big deal. Hell, maybe I even enjoyed being doted on like that. It made me feel really attractive, which I never really felt I was. 

Recently we attended a work event organized by my company, and we met one of my co-workers there. She works at a different branch and we hardly ever talk outside of work emails and calls, but we get along well enough. This event was my GFs first (and only) time meeting this coworker. On the way back from the event, and the following day, my GF was acting a little weird – she kept asking me about a ""work wife"", and asking fi I thought that co-worker was pretty, and other stuff about her. I knew my GF could get kinda jealous and I did my best to calm her down – no that woman isn't my work wife, I don't follow her on any socials, I don't even have her personal phone number. I don't think she's more beautiful than my GF and I am happy with my GF etc. and she seemed to relax, and thigns got back to normal.

A few weeks later, out of nowhere, I got a follow request on IG (my account is private) from my co-worker. I approved and followed back (her account is also private). That account was almost nothing but a few pictures of her in swimsuits, uploaded very recently (I haven't checked at the time and didn't really scroll her account at all). It didn't look like anything overtly sexy, just normal vacation pics, but there was nothing BUT vacation pics. It seemd weird but I didn't really care. Then a few days later she DMed me on IG. It was just small talk and I replied, but it wasn't flirty or anything (IMO). She kept reaching out every few days, and eventually it DID seem to get kinda flirty. I told her this felt inappropriate and I was in a relationship, and I'd appreciate if we kept things professional, which she seemed okay with.

My GF seemed extra affectionate the days after that, and while I didn't suspect anything in real time, you can all probably see exactly where this is going. Still, at the time I was happy, and my GF even seemed to be better regarding her jealousy. But then, last week, I got a follow recommendation on my IG – it was my co-worker's account. This one wasn't private, and was just a normal IG account, and looking through it – that was where those swimsuit pics came from, here they were just a part of her normal IG account which contained mostly normal pics, and not just swimsuit ones. I then put 2+2 together.

Before confronting my GF, I talked to that co-worker at work, and asked for her IG account – and she gave me her normal one, which I followed, and indeed she gave no indication that we ever interacted on IG before. So it became clear I WAS being catfished. I confronted my GF then, and at first when I was trying to be subtle, she denied everything outright. Then she shifted to gaslighting me about it and saying it was just a prank, or that it was a test, or that because she was cheated on before she just needed to know that she could trust me. I told her that her being able to trust me was great, but how am I supposed to trust her now? She said that made no sense, and kept deflecting no matter how I tried to explain, going so far as to question how I even knew it was her if I wasn't cheating on her with my co-worker. I told her that this was unfair and manipulative, and that I needed some time and went home. She's been texting and calling since, saying that I'm ruining a great relationship over nothing, I'm overreacting and that when I finally realize how much she loves me it might be too late, and it's not fair for me to throw everything we built out ""over some skank"", but that just feels incredibly manipulative to me, and like she doesn't get what she did wrong AT ALL.

So... I'm conflicted between wanting to just cut and run and giving it another go? After all we have been happy together for 2 years. But also, can trust be rebuilt after something like this?

 
Tl;dr - my gf pretended to be my co-worker on IG to catfish me as some sort of prank/test, and refuses to apologize. ",3140,0.97,3140,0,3240.0,100.0,381,1742729091.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jhx3yj/i_28m_am_considering_leaving_my_gf_29f_after_she/,False,True
1k6gl7t,relationship_advice,I (33F) was not invited to my boyfriend’s (31M) family wedding and now I want to skip their summer reunion.,"My boyfriend (31M) and I (33F) have been together for just over three years. We live together and are in a committed relationship. Over time, I've made a genuine effort to connect with his family. I've joined them for holidays, birthdays, and other gatherings. I've always tried to be kind, respectful, and supportive.

His aunt (46F), who's considered the last single aunt in the family, announced that she is getting married in June this year. It has been a big deal for everyone and the family is very excited. I assumed I would be attending the wedding with my boyfriend. I've met his aunt several times and we've always gotten along. There has never been any tension or awkwardness.

When I asked my boyfriend about the plans, he told me that he had been invited, but was not allowed to bring a plus one. I felt disappointed, but I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. I figured maybe the wedding was small or the guest list was limited.

Then I found out that his younger brother (26M), who has only been dating his girlfriend (20F) for about six months, was allowed to bring her to the wedding. That really hurt. I don't blame her at all, but it made me feel like I am not seen as part of the family, even after three years.

I talked to my boyfriend about how I felt. I explained that it made me feel excluded and undervalued. He listened and was supportive. He told me he understood why I was hurt and that my feelings were valid. At the same time, he feels that I shouldn't let this one event affect how I view his family as a whole. He thinks I should continue attending family gatherings, and that skipping them might make things more awkward or strained later on.

That's where I'm struggling. There's a family reunion coming up this summer in September. It is a big camping trip they do every year, and everyone attends. Normally I would go, but right now I don't feel comfortable. I want to sit this one out. I feel like I need time to process and protect my emotional space instead of forcing myself into a situation.

I love my boyfriend, and I'm not trying to create a rift or make him choose sides. I just need some space to think about what this all means for me and how I fit into his world moving forward.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you find the balance between protecting your feelings and staying connected with your partner's family?

--------------------

Edit/Update:

Wow, I didn't expect this to get so much attention overnight. Thank you all for the kind comments and support. I truly appreciate it. I also wanted to clear up a few things and share an update. Some of the comments speculating that my boyfriend was being shady actually made me laugh.

The wedding invitation was sent out in March through The Knot website. I went through the whole site, including the couple's story and the Q&amp;A section. To RSVP, you have to type in your full name, and it will indicate whether you're invited solo or with a plus one. When my boyfriend entered his name, only his name came up, no plus one. Out of curiosity, we typed in his younger brother's name, and his did include his girlfriend's name. In the Q&amp;A section, it said the guest list was limited, and only those listed by name were invited.

At first, my boyfriend was upset and wanted to reach out to his aunt directly. I told him not to, since I didn't want to add any extra stress to her while she's planning her wedding. I helped my best friend plan hers last year, so I know how overwhelming it can be. Instead, he called his dad to talk about it. He stepped out for the conversation, so I'm not exactly sure what was said.

After I posted about it last night, I brought it up again with my boyfriend. He was hesitant at first, but eventually opened up. I had a gut feeling about his younger brother, and it turns out I wasn't wrong. The couple decided not to invite unwed partners, but they made an exception for his younger brother. From what I've seen and heard over the years, he's definitely the family favorite. He was a NICU baby and the family has treated him with extra care. He usually gets what he wants and rarely faces consequences.

As we talked more, my boyfriend admitted he does feel some resentment toward his younger brother. He said it's always felt like his brother receives special treatment, and this is just another example. He's come to accept it because it's been that way since his brother was born. There are clearly deeper emotions at play for him, and I want to support him through that.

I also found out that a cousin's (34M) long-term girlfriend (29F) of eight years wasn't invited either. That made me feel a little less alone. She's actually more upset about it than I am. I reached out to her, and we're planning a spa and nail day on the wedding day. Honestly, it helps to know I'm not the only one feeling left out.

My boyfriend and the cousin are still planning to attend the wedding to support their aunt, which I completely understand. It's an important day for her. It still stings that I wasn't included, but I've accepted that I can't control how others choose to handle their guest lists or family dynamics. I'm choosing to focus on my peace instead. I'm still undecided about attending the family reunion camping trip, but if the cousin's girlfriend goes, I'll be more open to it.

P.S. The petty part of me wants to not invite this couple to our future wedding when my boyfriend and I get married, and also not give the younger brother a plus one. It made me laugh just thinking about it. I might get over it by then, but I thought it was a funny little thought worth sharing.",3140,0.97,3140,0,3240.0,100.0,525,1745459533.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k6gl7t/i_33f_was_not_invited_to_my_boyfriends_31m_family/,False,True
1oqe4ay,relationship_advice,I (31F) just had a major surgery and my bf (36m) hasn't reached out to see if i'm okay or attempted to see me,"On Tuesday morning, I had my gallbladder removed. I've been with my boyfriend for 9 months now. We both live with our parents at the moment for financial reasons. My dad works during the day and my mom is disabled, so she can't do much on her own around the house. This surgery basically immobilized me and I've had to rely on my mom to help me in and out of bed, in the bathroom, etc. My boyfriend told me he wasn't going to stay with me during my recovery because there was ""no point"" and I'd basically ""just be sleeping the whole time."" He lost his job in September, so he's currently unemployed.

The last time he contacted me was Tuesday night. I didn't hear from him at all yesterday or today. I'm thinking that a conversation needs to be had because it upsets me a lot that he hasn't asked me how I'm doing or had any desire to come see me or help out, but I don't know what to say.

I feel like I should also mention that around the 5 month mark of our relationship, I told him I loved him and he told me it was too soon to say that, despite the fact that we had been friends for over a year before we started dating. Like I said, we've been dating for 9 months now and he still hasn't said I love you. My birthday was last month and he said ""Happy Birthday"" 2 days before it, and then argued with me when I told him he was early, saying that I told him the wrong day. He also did not get me even a small gift, a card, nothing. There have been other times when I wanted to go somewhere or do something, but he didn't feel like it so I ended up doing them by myself.

Is it time to move on? I don't really feel like he gives that much of a crap about me.

UPDATE: Wow! I was not expecting so many responses. Thank you all for your well wishes. I'm having a smooth recovery so far! 

As for my relationship- He did end up calling me late last night. Said he ""figured he'd check in."" When I asked him why it took so long for him to reach out, he said he didn't want to bother me if I was resting. I know that's just a lame excuse, and I honestly didn't have the energy to argue with him at the time.

For now I'm just going to leave it alone and ignore him until I get some of my strength back, but once I'm feeling better, I'll end things. I do deserve someone who is more attentive and caring. 

I appreciate all the support and encouragement! I'll come back for another update once I break things off. 

UPDATE 2:

I ended things with him last night. I was honest with him and basically summarized everything from this post. He was more upset than I thought he would be, but in the end he said he was glad he had the opportunity to be with me and he wished me the best. I do feel bad because I know he's hurt, but overall I think it was the right choice.

Thank you all for your advice and support! I'm pretty much back to my normal self now. I still have a little soreness but I feel so much better.

1os64bz,relationship_advice,My (38M) Wife (36F) wants to sleep with other people because I’m ‘not exciting’ - but I pay for everything and handle the kids,"TLDR: Wife wants to open marriage... I am devastated and considering divorce. Maybe it's over...

Me (38M) and my wife (36F) have been together for 12 years, married for 9. We have two kids (7 and 4), and like a lot of couples with young kids, the last few years haven’t been easy. I work full-time in IT, am the main breadwinner, handle most of the kid stuff in the mornings, and try to give her space in the evenings because she says she’s “burned out.” (Drinks wine and on the phone)

We have had basically a dead BR, not because I don’t want it, but because she’s said that she needs more from me... And I’ve tried. We have done some couples therapy. I tried inviting her to date nights (she flakes), mentioned sexy outfits or games, even a stupid TikTok challenge I thought might help. It's been a while now... I feel like I'm trying and she's not. At all.

Three nights ago, she sits me down and says: “You’re not exciting me anymore. I need more. I want to explore. I think we should open the marriage.”

I was shocked. I asked her if this meant she already had someone in mind. She said no but then couldn’t look me in the eye at all...

I don’t check her phone and never have. Always trusted her. But she’s been weird lately and protective of the screen, walking into the other room more, laughing at messages and saying “it’s just dumb work stuff.” She’s mentioned a coworker several times now, ""Brian."" I’ve met him once and didn’t like him the vibe. I didn't like how they interacted and something felt off...

I said, “You want to sleep with other people because I’m not exciting?”

She said, “No, that’s not fair. I just want something more. We can both explore.”

Then she added, “I still love you. I just want different experiences.”

I told her NO, obviously not... I’m not going to support our ENTIRE life while being treated like some placeholder she’s bored of. I’m not your husband *until something more exciting shows up.*

Now she is saying that I’m selfish and close-minded. That this is about “sexual growth” and I’m too rigid...

*I’m* selfish???? For not wanting to be the loyal exhausted man supporting her “personal journey” while Brian from accounting makes her giggle at 10pm?

I strongly suspect some of this idea is coming from her BFF. She just got divorced for the *third time*, tried an old open marriage before (which is what blew up her second go-round), and has been a serial cheater... UGH.

I want to make this work for the kids... But I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here.

I don't know if it's time to throw in the towel, or what...

EDIT (a few hours since posting):  Wow… I didn’t expect this to get this kind of attention.

I really appreciate all your comments, I will read every one. To say it's been a surreal night is an understatement.

Some have been hard to read, but so much has helped... Maybe more than anything just to get out of my own head.

I’m not making any big decisions tonight. The kids are asleep, my wife’s out with friends and I’m home alone, just processing it all. Trying to figure out what to do next...

But the message is loud and clear:  
*Get a lawyer. STD tests. She's (probably?) fucking Brian.*

So I shared about this incident to my friends, and they have urged me to make plans with them to Barcelona itself. I agreed and we went to do a bit of shopping for it. I have been feeling way better now after talking to them and all the support you guys gave too, so I'm really grateful. 

My husband had been texting me continuously for a while now, I am staying at my friends house for a while.  
I texted him saying that I wasn't happy with the company he kept and told him about what his friend did (showing me their pictures). I also told him that he admitted I was ugly to his friends.

He's answered by saying that he was mostly drunk and didn't mean it, and that he and his friends culture is where its normal to comment on people's appearances and not take it to heart, and said all the cheesy stuff after that about how he still thinks I'm really beautiful, but I can't accept that anymore. He told he'll talk to his friends about it and ask them to apologise. I also told him that I can leave if he still has feelings for his friend, and he said that it was all a past fling and there's a reason they broke up. He told I'm the one he wants to have kids with, but I feel like he wants me to be a baby producing machine for his family.

I am still looking for a lawyer and my brother has offered me help too, he got really angry after hearing about the situation. I have a place of my own where I might shift to after I come back from the trip. My husband is back to constantly calling, though i texted him to stop and he hasn't done anything yet.  


I'm still a bit confused, but I think this trip is going to help me clear my mind. I haven't told him anything yet, and I am thinking of blocking him in my socials, though my friends suggest he see that I am living my best even without him.

My friend and I no longer live close so our main activity together is going out for lunch or dinner at the halfway point. 

Her fiancée has this habit that started as annoying but is now a step above that. 

I like to get a few different appetizers instead of a main course. He’ll always say “You’re getting *all* that?” Or even tell the waiter “I don’t think we need all that,” like I’m a child. 

It’s weird and frustrating and I can’t get it to stop. We always do separate tabs so it’s not as though it’s a financial concern. It never breaks up the pace of the meal, I just get the appetizers served during the main course. 

I’ve tried playing it off in a light but clear way, I’ve tried politely addressing it. It goes right over their heads. I’ve asked my friend about it privately and she says “Yeah, it’s annoying, he does it to me too. But he’s great overall so, I look past it.” 

I obviously won’t lose my relationship with one of my oldest and closest friends over this but it is making me extremely uncomfortable, I already have poor body image and relationship to food. 

Any ideas what I can do? Thanks in advance. ",3088,0.98,3088,0,3152.0,64.0,468,1748859553.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l1edyd/how_do_i_get_my_31f_friends_fiancée_40m_to_stop/,False,True
1iqbpip,relationship_advice,Husband admitted that he's poly. What now? M25 F26,"For the entire time we've known each other, my husband has said that he is monogamous. No problem with me, since I'm monogamous as well. We've been married for six months now (dated for two years) and this has never even been a problem I've considered before.

Well, today my husband decided to drop the bombshell that he's been polyamorous this whole time. He said that he realized it when he was a teenager. His reasoning for why he kept this from me was that a previous girlfriend had broken up with him over it and he was scared that I would do the same. (Did I appreciate this vote of confidence over my commitment to our relationship? Not really! Why did he drop this on me today? No idea!)

After I calmed down my husband told me that he didn't feel that I wasn't enough or anything like that. Just that ""being with one person felt off"" and he didn't ""want to be tied with just one person forever."" At this point I reminded him that he quite literally signed a legal document that tied us together forever, and he didn't have a good answer for that.

Even disregarding how insane it feels that he's kept this from me for so long, I have no idea where to go from here. I don't have a problem with people being poly or having open marriages. I've always had the mindset that it wasn't for me, but it wasn't any of my business. Except now it is my business and I really don't want it to be.

On one hand, I don't like the idea of my husband having to ignore this part of himself for my sake. Even though he tells me that I am enough for him, I don't know if I should believe him or not. I want him to be happy.

But on the other hand, I know that opening up the marriage would make me unhappy. I've been reading other people's experiences and almost everyone says that communicating with each other about the people you're seeing is the healthiest way to do it, but even the idea of my husband telling me about these people he's going out with makes me feel sick. I don't have any interest in seeing other people so this would only be for his benefit, and would make me feel like shit.

I feel like I'm backed into a corner with no good way to go. I don't see any sort of compromise where we're both happy. I want to work this out, but I just don't know how. Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation and has any advice? Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: I will make a longer post with a full update later. He is cheating on me and I am looking to annul the marriage.

1m9brc5,relationship_advice,"I (27M) discovered my wife's (30F) family was behind my vicious cyberbullying attack. My wife knew, but she hid it for years. How do I move past this?","My (27M) marriage is in a really bad spot after a deep breach of trust. Idk how to recover or how to trust my wife (30F) again.

For some context, we've been together 7 years and married 5. We have a child (2M). We met at a con. I thought her cosplay was amazing, struck up a conversation, and the rest is history. She's the most loving, unselfish, and decent person I've ever met.

Our relationship was never without its challenges. Our biggest obstacle was her family. My presence was unwelcome. They're very close-knit, and if one doesn't accept you, then you're not getting far.

There are a few family members who broke away from the pack, but no one hardly acknowledges them. They're no contact and black sheep.

I didn't know how my wife's family was, but I did know family was extremely important to her. Her whole upbringing was based on family. So I tried everything in my power to make it work. They didn't really put up with me until our son.

Between our wedding planning to shortly before the wedding, I was the target of some relentless and vicious cyberbullying. It got personal. Fake bad reviews polluted my business profile too. It cost me some potential clients.

I didn't know where it came from or why. I couldn't find a solution. I'd report, but it'd take a while for anything to be done, or there'd be more accounts coming out for another round. The whole thing impacted my life and my mental health. It took a toll.

My wife was incredibly supportive. She was my rock and my best friend. I loved her even more for her care and how she held me down. Then the trolling and everything stopped.

I wanted nothing more than to move on. I put it all behind me until the other day my wife confessed that her family was behind the harassment. I didn't believe her at first, but she was serious and showed me proof in their family group chat.

It felt like I was right back there again. They were gloating and justifying themselves. Saying stuff like ""Some people gotta learn the hard way"" and ""If he wants to join the fold, here's his initiation.""

I knew I wasn't their favorite person, but I never realized they hated me and would go to such extremes. I asked my wife when did she find out and if she was a part of it. She swore she wasn't and that she'd never do that to me.

She claims she didn't initially know it was her family until a few months before our wedding. One of my SIL's (28F) left a profile up on her phone, and my wife saw it. She confronted her family and made them stop.

I asked why she was telling me everything now. She said it was weighing on her, and she opened up to her eldest sister (35F), one of the family's black sheep. She threatened to tell me the truth if my wife didn't.

Nothing my wife said made it better. She knew for years what her family did and hid it from me. She kept everything quiet. It hurts more coming from her because she knew firsthand my pain.

I was pretty numb. My wife was anxious and kept pushing for me to say something. I told her there wasn't anything she could say right now that would make it ok. What she did was no better than her family. They made my life hell, and her first instinct was to cover for them.

She started crying and begged me to understand. She said it wasn't like that, and she was trying to make things right with as little damage as possible and mend relationships.

I wasn't very receptive to her. She wasn't reaching me. I couldn't help her or myself. I told her I needed some time to clear my head. She was against it. She said we could work through this together, but I was firm on space.

Space isn't a request she's respected. I'm really trying to understand her side. I'm trying to move past it, but I feel so betrayed. I trusted her more than anyone. I'm my most vulnerable with her. I kept opening up to her about the incident even after she knew the truth.

She encouraged me to let it go and not allow it to have any claim on me. I thought she had my best interest in mind. Now I just see it as her attempt to protect her family yet again.

I haven't confronted anyone involved. I don't think they're worth it. But I've made it clear they're no longer allowed to see our son until further notice. Now I'm getting texts about how I'm depriving my child of grandparents and aunts over past family spats.

One of the hardest parts is the distance from my wife. She's my best friend and partner in every way. Now we're mostly only communicating about our son and other household necessities.

She's hurt by my rejection, and she's been crying often. Idk if I'm being unfair to her. I hate all of this. I want to make our marriage work, but I'm questioning our relationship up to now. I'm just really lost. I need an outside perspective.

How do I navigate this situation and move forward for my marriage and myself?

TL;DR My marriage is in a bad spot. Idk how to trust my wife again. I was the target of some relentless and vicious cyberbullying for months. It impacted my life and my mental health. I put it behind me until my wife confessed that her family was the culprit. She showed me proof in their group chat. I knew I wasn't their favorite person, but I never realized they hated me. My wife swears she didn't initially know and that she made them stop. But she still hid it for years. She begged me to understand and said that she was trying to make things right for us and our son. I asked for space to clear my head. She hasn't exactly respected that request. I'm really trying to move past it, but I feel so betrayed by her. Idk if I'm being unfair. I want to make our marriage work, but I'm questioning everything.

1hi95r8,relationship_advice,"UPDATE: I (26F) have been giving gifts to my boyfriend (29M)'s family at many celebrations, without anything in return. Do I continue?","Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1gztd76/i\_26f\_have\_been\_giving\_gifts\_to\_my\_boyfriend\_29ms/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gztd76/i_26f_have_been_giving_gifts_to_my_boyfriend_29ms/)

TL;DR of my original post is that I have gifted my boyfriend's family (his sister, his mom, his sister's kid) gifts on \~10 occasions this year (probably spent \~$800 total), but haven't received anything in return, and was wondering if I should switch to doing joint gifts with my boyfriend. 

Some commenters suggested that I was not being appreciative of being invited to family events, so I thought that maybe I was being too harsh. Well, with Christmas coming up, I (26F) was invited to Christmas with my boyfriend (29M)'s family, but given his sister (28F) just had her second child with some health complications, we had a conversation and decided it made sense for me not to join them as I've been flying a lot for work and don't want to put the newborn at risk. That made the conversation about doing joint gifts super easy with my boyfriend, since I physically wouldn't be there. 

Out of the blue yesterday though, I received a text from my boyfriend's sister ""reminding"" me of their house address to ship gifts to (even though I've driven there multiple times). Then, about an hour later, I receive a text from my boyfriend's mother telling me about how the sister's daughter (toddler) has been a little upset recently given the new baby, and that it would be great to get the toddler an extra gift to make her feel ""special"" since the attention has been on the newborn, on top of whatever I was planning to get the newborn. She did top it off with a ""you always give such nice gifts!"" as a nice compliment.  

For context, I grew up in a family that taught me not to buy gifts that you wouldn't want to receive. I bought very nice things for boyfriend's sister's kids for her daughter's birthday (toys + nice name brand clothing like Nike, Northface), and the latest baby shower for the newborn.

I brought this to the attention of my boyfriend, and he mentioned he'd let them know that he was bringing our gifts, but I have a feeling they'll misinterpret to think that we're still getting separate gifts. We will see how it goes next week, but I've been super put off by the texts that I've gotten from his family - it seems pretty blatant that they want gifts from me and are expecting it, but I'm glad that my boyfriend is planning to take care of the communications... 


EDIT - adding my update that was in the comments here since people keep dming me for a resolution when I’ve already provided one in comments 

Now that the holidays are finally over, (and I realized that people are actually waiting for a conclusion thx to best of redditor updates) I thought I’d come here to post an update. Some new happenings unfolded through the new year that I had to deal with, hence the delay.

Pre-Christmas: I texted back to his family what I had written in the previous comment, and boyfriend called his mom and sister, which I didn’t hear the full conversation of. The message he conveyed was that we would be bringing a joint gift and listed out all the gifts I had given them this year, and pointed out that they neither wished me a happy birthday or got me a gift for Christmas last year. Apparently he was nice about it and said that he knew money was tight for them and that we’d be doing joint gift moving forwards so they wouldn’t have to worry about a return gift (this is a very fine arrangement with me). 
He hates shopping anyways, so he gave me a budget for each of his family members and I chose the gifts for him. He didn’t mention to his family I hadn’t pitched in any money. 

Christmas: I had a lovely Christmas with my family, but boyfriend calls me at noon. He tells me to ignore any texts I might get from his family and that he will explain when we are together. I don’t get anything from them until the evening - a text from his mom that just says “*bf name* will bring back presents from us to you. It would be great if you could come celebrate NYE with us as the baby is in stable condition, and we will celebrate the baby’s recovery. No need to bring anything for us, just the baby” I forwarded the message to BF. Apparently his family had bought me literal dollar store gifts in an attempt for us to keep doing separate gifts that he was refusing to bring back to me. They wanted to do another celebration on NYE for more gifts for the baby. BF told me he had already told them we weren’t going. It overall was just minor drama because I never had to talk to anyone from his family, he handled it all. He told them that if they were going to treat me like that, we would no longer be joining their celebrations. 

Day after Christmas: my boyfriend came over to visit my family for Christmas, my parents still got him a gift. He immediately felt really bad and we spent most the day together with my family + planning a NYE/NY date night between the two of us. It was exciting. I thought that was the end of it. 

before New Year’s: boyfriend’s mom calls him while he’s at my place and basically starts breaking down. She says that boyfriend and I make more than his family (mom, dad, sister, brother in law) combined and apparently the debt of his parents and sister are much larger sums than he had assumed. Apparently they *really appreciated* my gifts because it felt like a little bit of *luxury* in what felt like a life of “despair” given their snowballing debt. They had too much pride to say anything and basically ended up bullying me about it (boyfriends words) instead to get things they wanted. apparently he texted his mom about the gift my parents got him and it made her feel like she was going to lose him to me / my family because of money. Boyfriend told her that it wasn’t about money - it was about treating people with basic decency. They talked a looooot more but the tl;dr is that his fam has been under a lot of financial stress and pressure, much much more than we had thought, and was a bit spiteful of how much money we earn, and wants help. 

I reflected on all the comments saying I was being a door mat, and I think my stance on this is that I knew I didn’t need gifts from them - I just wanted a little more appreciation. So I was in a little bit of a pickle about what to do - because I genuinely enjoyed gifting and picking out gifts, but also felt like I was being used. I just wanted them to appreciate the gifts. Maybe that’s petty (saw a comment saying you should never expect anything in return when gifting). To those saying BF is a problem, I think this might be a relatively new thing with his family that he’s just now recognizing. Debt accumulation is recent, past 2 yrs after his sister had her first kid. He’s handled it gracefully as it unraveled. 

We spent NYE and NY with just the two of us. It was lovely. We don’t have a resolution on how we will deal with his family yet. He holds strong boundaries and won’t be giving them any money, but will continue to bring gifts to celebrations his family hosts (if he’s still invited lol)

1k4sl9a,relationship_advice,I (32F) don't know how to react to my husband's (36M) birthday surprise.,"Together 8 years, married 7 years

So, I guess I just want to know if I'm crazy, how other men might plan their wife's birthday celebration given the conversation and if you'd be surprised at my reaction. 

About a month ago my husband (36M) asks me (32F) what I want to do for my birthday. I say I'd like to take a trip for the weekend. He specifically asks if I want a bunch of people involved or if I want it to be just the two of us. I tell him, just the two of us. My birthday though, almost always falls on Mother's Day weekend and for the past couple of years we've gone out of town and missed the holiday for my mom. So I say, maybe we can go to celebrate my birthday either the weekend before or after so we can spend Mother's Day with mom. 

Cool, no problem. I text my mom a couple days later who says she has to work and can't do anything anyways. So I let him know the weekend is free for whatever he wants to plan. 

So today, he asks if I'd like to know where we're going for my bday. The conversation goes:

Husband: Do you want to know where we're going for your birthday?

Me: Yes, I can start planning my outfits

Husband: We're going to Alabama!

Me: Really? Alabama? What's in Alabama?

Husband: It's right on the border of GA/TN near Chattanooga 

(My aunt and uncle live near Chattanooga)

Me: We're not going to visit aunt and uncle are we? 

Husband: No

Me: Did you tell them we're coming? 

Him: Yea

Me: Awww man I just wanted it to be the two of us

Him: Well then you're really not going to like what I'm about to say. Your mom, little sister, older sister and nephew are also coming. 

Me: (A little speechless because I think he must be kidding but disappointment growing in my voice) But I thought we were going away, just the two of us. 

This then becomes an exchange of him telling me I'm ungrateful, how hard he worked to plan all this and that he thought I'd want to spend mothers day and my birthday all together as a family and me trying to explain my reaction based on prior conversations, my expectations being based on what we talked about previously  and truly being impressed that he could get my family together for this. 

We hung up suddenly because he had to go. I felt bad, I could hear the hurt in his voice because he thought he was giving me what I wanted, but I just don't understand how when I thought I made it pretty clear. 

So back to the questions up top. Would you be surprised at my reaction given the conversations prior? Am I ungrateful? Am I justified in being disappointed? How would you all have gone about plans with the conversations that were had?

1hfs39u,relationship_advice,"This weekend I (29F) got very drunk and told my boyfriend's (35M) friend's wife that he is cheating on her - I regret this a lot and created a big mess for everyone involved, and am looking for any advice on how to potentially try to salvage these relationships?","My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half, and he recently bought a ring but hasn't proposed. I think that might now be out the window because this weekend I got very drunk, and - stupidly and carelessly - and I cannot believe I did this - said to the friend's wife that the friend isn't faithful to her. Ugh.

This man does cheat on his wife constantly, as does his other friend who was there with us that night (with his pregnant wife). I have a lot of issues surrounding all of this - and I've talked to my boyfriend about how much it bothers me a ton, and he has basically said that these are his long-term friends and their actions aren't his responsibility or his fault. I do really trust my boyfriend, and love him so much, but I have serious trauma about married men being unfaithful because my boyfriend prior to this was secretly married and it really messed me up.

I've projected that resentment and anxiety onto his friends, and I've felt it inside but kept it in, up until Saturday when I made the comment to his wife while wasted. It caused a fight between them, my boyfriend and I went home, and I texted the wife the next day to apologize (and also said that I was projecting things when I told her about the cheating - my boyfriend asked me to cover it up and I did, because I wanted to try to somehow preserve the relationship between my boyfriend and I and not jeopardize the friend's marriage - even though it gutted me to do so on a lot of levels).

I know my feelings of anger about the cheating friends are valid, but it absolutely wasn't my place to say anything. I'm looking into therapy to handle my anger on infidelity, and I am considering seeking treatment for alcohol too, because I think I've been using that to cope with the painful feelings I still have that are leftover from my last relationship. But I'm freaking out because now I have created this giant mess - both for my boyfriend, his friend, wife, and for the relationship between my boyfriend and I. I damaged his trust a ton, and I know look like a liar and manipulator. I am reeling and incredibly embarrassed and sad and really looking for any advice people might have about how I should approach things with my boyfriend, and if there is anything else that people could think I could try to do to make up for my mistake. Thank you in advance for any thoughts you might have. I'm really struggling and feel awful.

  
TLDR; I got wasted and told my boyfriend's friend's wife that he is cheating on her (even though this is true it was NOT my place to share). I backtracked and the next day texted her to apologize and to say that this wasn't true, because my boyfriend wanted me to cover. This has caused a giant mess, and I deeply betrayed my boyfriend's trust, along with damaging my relationship with his entire friend group. I'm looking for any advice on how to try to make up for my mistake.",3051,0.89,3051,0,3481.0,430.0,3298,1734379434.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hfs39u/this_weekend_i_29f_got_very_drunk_and_told_my/,False,True
1nlluec,relationship_advice,"I (30F) just found my friend's (30F) husband (35M) on an ""are we dating the same guy"" group.","Hey reddit,

I'm on one of those ""are we dating the same guy"" groups on Facebook, and upon scrolling, I found my friend's husband of 2 years posted a few months ago- right when he was planning her epic 30th birthday bash so I would say they were very much together. The anonymous poster was asking if anyone had any safety concerns about him before she went on a date with him. There was only one comment (from two weeks ago) by a different anonymous commenter that said they've been talking to him for a while and were planning to go on a date.

The picture used for the post is a bit dated (definitely from before I've known him), but the poster used his name, age and location. I even shared the picture of him and a current picture of him with other friends to get their opinion to see if they thought it was the same guy, and they all agreed without knowing the context. His social media is also locked, so I don't think this is a catfish situation.

For some context, I've been friends with the wife for 7 years and we have been there for eachother through the many different chapters that life brings. We have drifted apart a bit over the years as we live in different cities, but we still catch-up every couple of months. I absolutely do plan on telling her but I'm unsure how to do so as I feel so horrible about potentially blowing up her life (well, he did but I hate being the messenger for something so awful). Any advice for how you'd alert a friend about a potentially cheating husband?

1hevmwq,relationship_advice,Do I (F40) break up my 11 year marriage  to my husband (M39) because of Christmas?,"I (F40) have been married to my husband (M39) for 11 years we have 3 children. The relationship is mostly good, but we've had some strained times that have taken some working through.

My biggest issue currently though is Christmas. I have such happy memories of family Christmas' growing up. I loved Christmas with my family, we sang, we played games, we ate. Christmas morning was always slow, involved church, preparing (this was a whole family activity) and eating Christmas dinner, then gifts, films/games/songs and Christmas tea all followed.

My husbands Christmas' growing up has many of the same ingredients, Gifts, TV, Christmas Dinner, but he's told me all the gifts were opened before breakfast then they played with their gifts and didn't interact much after that.

Over the years of our relationship I've never felt like I've had a Christmas like I did growing up with my husband. Most of them I've been reduced to tears each Christmas eve/ and or Christmas dad. He suspects he's autistic and anything other than what he grew up with is a problem.

If it's not what he ate for breakfast growing up as a kid, it's not Christmas. If I want the kids to wait to open presents so we can all be present it's a problem. If I ask for help making Christmas Dinner it's unreasonable, because he wants to spend time with the kids (and his mother always cooks), If I cook any of the 2 vegetables he bothers to eat, I've ruined it for everyone. If I suggest playing a game I'm told not to bother the kids because they want to look at there new toys (even when they've asked to play a new board game they got). I want to watch a Christmas film I end up watching it by myself.

I've tried talking to him about compromises over they years, but I've got no where. The past couple of years I've given up even trying because I'm too tired to argue with ""I'm autistic, I can't deal with it any other way"". My mother tried to speak to him about it after witnessing me in tears on Christmas day for years, now he goes around bitching because she doesn't understand how Autism works.

I am now at a point where I am dreading Christmas, it always seems to end up with me upset and disappointed. In his defence, the kids don't know to expect anything different to what I have written and they seem happy, I just know that a family Christmas can be so much more.

It seems stupid to break up a marriage over a couple of days, but I have thought about it. I just can't see a way forward for things to improve.

  
\*\*Edit\*\*

Thanks for those who commented - in the time it has taken to post this, deal with family life and have time to sit back on my laptop the post has been locked so I haven't been able to reply directly. 

  
For those who mentioned it. We are trying to get a diagnosis, but time and money are a factor, we priorities money for the kids. 

  
This isn't our marriage 365 days of the year, the problems come with anything out of day to day life. Family vacations never go well for us, he would rather avoid them all together, I live for vacations. 

For those of you who said go to therapy, I have in the past and I'm willing to do couples therapy, but it takes two to make that work. 

  
Why not take the kids off to my family myself, I nearly did a couple of years ago, but in reality the distance is just too far to make it pleasant for the kids. 

  
For those of you who said I should learn to compromise and not throw away a good marriage. I do want to compromise, I loved my family Christmas, but I'm under no illusions it's the only way to do it (to the person who said it sounds exhausting/dull, you actually made me laugh thinking about how others might have read that). But I am exhausted, not just with 3 kids but the added stress of the husband and working full time.

He complained about no time and there's no money. So I help get it, dusk till dawn so that we can do this. We pick a day together. 

We make most of our goal for the trip, I borrowed a few dollars to get items for the trip, I did put the money back in the next day. 

I calculate our expected expenses just to make sure our goal is enough, I ask what we have from deliveries in total, this idiot spent it.

 All.of.it. 

I of course asked him what happened? He said ""some expenses came up, that he had to eat and live as well, we'll make the money back."" On top of ""if I expect him to feel bad about it"" 

Do I expect you to feel bad about spending our trip fund? That I also worked hard on earning? I told him he should've starved before touching that. Bread, butter, and sugar before a finger touched that money. 

I'm considering ditching him. Ghost. 

I was looking forward to that trip, I've working hard back to back for so long, I was ready for some peace and solitude at the beach. I needed it, bad. And the money was there for it and it was gone in a day. I can feel myself breaking down a bit, I really don't want to be a vile person to him. 

Is this something that I should even try to move forward from? Its hard for me to honestly look at him right now. I'm tired of things being stripped from me my whole life, he was the last person that I needed doing that right now.

1lvya17,relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (41M) has an expensive hobby so we have to live very frugally and it's starting to bother me (39F), I'm not sure what to do.","My boyfriend (41M) and I (39F) have been together for about a year. He's a caring and considerate partner. However, he lives very frugally to be able to afford his expensive hobby. He loves to sail and between the costs of financing his boat (which he purchased before we met), fuel costs, insurance, marina fees, maintenance, etc. -- I would estimate that it creates around 3K+ each month in expenses. This comes out of his disposable income so he's not asking me to pay for any of it but it's not a interest I share (I don't particularly like being on boats). I think sailing really gives him a lot of peace and a sense of pride. 

We mostly split expenses, and I don't live a particularly expensive lifestyle -- I don't have a huge desire to visit fancy restaurants and am happy taking a weekend road trip instead of some big international trip, and so for a while it didn't bother me that he spends so much on his hobby. He also is very conscientious about saving so he saves a large portion of his income as well, and I support him wanting to build his savings. 

However, we don't currently live together, partially because of how frugally he chooses to live in order to be able to afford this hobby. He has a tiny condo and no car, though I have a car. He eats very simply. If we were to move in together, we'd need to move into a smaller apartment than I'd prefer (we live in an expensive city) or move somewhere else or he'd need to save less. 

If it were up to me, we'd spend more on activities, splurge from time to time, and get a decent-sized apartment, etc. However, he's not really on board with those expenses, except on a holidays (like a birthday, etc.). We still go out to do stuff, but obviously he prefers inexpensive/free local events, which I also enjoy but it would be nice to do other stuff too. If I want to go to a pricey concert or to the theater or do a spa day or whatever, I'll generally end up doing that stuff with friends. 

He's someone who is willing to compromise on things, but I don't even know what to ask him for? Sell his boat? He had it before we met. Stop saving? That sounds like I'm asking him to be irresponsible. I could offer to pay for more stuff, but I think that would create a very bad relationship imbalance, especially when he makes more than I do. 

Honestly, I'm not sure what to do? I feel like a jerk asking him to give up his hobby or like I was being immature, telling him not to worry so much about saving money. Dump him? He's honestly a great guy. At the same time, it seems silly that our lives are so limited when both of us have okay income. I'm not sure what to do here. Or maybe I should just be happy he's a good guy.

1j9deke,relationship_advice,My (23F) husband (25M) admitted that his younger brother yelled at him for how he treats me? - UPDATE I left him.,"So I left him, everyone was right about him. 

I'm safe, with my daughter and my little brother. It's been a few weeks since I left. 

Even after I posted last time, I won't lie... I *still* had hope for this man. What made me decide to leave was the fact that, despite him verbally abusing me, later threatening to physically abuse me, he acted like I was the one who needed to bend over and apologize to him. 

It wasn't that he treated me bad that was the reason I left. It was the fact that he was stomping around and acting like a child, yelling at me and *my daughter* and making her feel anxious. 

I still, tried to be nice. I tried to talk to him. I asked him what's wrong and he just gave me that look that he alwasy does. I don't know how to explain it but it makes me feel so small and he doesn't break his gaze or say anything he just *stares* until I have to look away.

It felt like a switch in me and mentally, I was gone. That night, I put my emergency plan in place (because I already had one from a time he threatened me months ago) and a few days later I was physically gone while he was at work.

I'm not going to give details because of the possibility he can see these  but I have a new job, new apartment, at a new city however and where ever I WANT. It's so freeing.

My daughter couldn't care less and it's somehow makes me happy but also deeply sad. I should've done this a month ago, 6 months ago, 1 year ago.. She's just happy that she gets to go to a park more often now with her uncle. My brother confided that he's happy he doesn't have to hear him yell anymore.

My family keeps calling me. My mom telling me I'm making a big mistake and I'm embarrassing myself. I'm not even going to bother explaining myself or my side of the story.

His family keeps calling me too. His mother apparently is in the hospital because of a stress induced attack from this. My sister in laws sent me nasty texts and called me until I blocked them. My now ex keeps calling me too. I hate it. It makes me feel sick to my stomach.

My brother in law only sent me one text and it says ""Good for you, I hope find a better life"" 

It makes me feel somewhat comforted with this whole situation. I hope he's right though.

So that's my update. This will be my last time posting on here. I'm probably going to delete my account actually and plus I'm completely done with relationships and will probably never get into one again but thank you to everyone who took time to comment and message me. I seriously feel like each one slowly built my confidence bit by bit. I know I'm a bad person for not doing it on my own so I thank all of you sincerely for helping me. I owe everyone my new life. I wasn't going to post at first but it feels nice to get this all off my chest. I feel like I'm going to explode with pent up emotions lately.

Edit to add. Btw guys, I lied in all my posts about my age. I'm actually 21. I'm not sure why I lied, but it's nice to be out there about it.

For everyone who attempted to talk some sense into me-

You all have **no idea** how many times the comments in the original post saved me from going back and second-guessing myself. You literally saved me. 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. The moment I stepped back fully, I felt so much more like myself- a confident, lively, and silly version of myself. I missed her so much, and to add to it, my 31st birthday felt like a complete rebirth.

Almost a year later, I’m somehow the happiest I’ve ever been. My entire life fell apart, and I struggled immensely, but surprise! Everything worked out. Now I’m in a new relationship, and it feels so peaceful (which took a lot of adjusting, too). The ex feels like a past life. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

For anyone reading this: please leave the abusive relationship!!!  
If you’re questioning whether it’s abusive, the odds of it being so are high. Your sanity, mental wellness, and physical health matter. Don’t forget that. It does get better, not only in movies.

1j76s0b,relationship_advice,Friend (31F) upset after I (27F) asked her to leave when I was in labour/about to give birth. How do I solve this?,"Hi everyone. Hope it’s okay I post this. 

I’m part of a friend group of 8 women (ages 26-31). I’m the second person to have a baby. They mean the world to me, especially since I have no relatives left. We all get along great, though I’m particularly close with Jess, who I’ve know since high school &amp; even lived with for a bit. 

This mostly revolves around the day I gave birth, but I guess it started a few months before. All of them were doing so much effort for me &amp; I couldn’t be more grateful. One friend (Elisa from now on) kept getting more &amp; more involved though, sometimes making me feel a bit uncomfortable. 

Had to ask her a few times to stop touching my bump &amp; she’d get sad. She’s joke about about wanting to be there when the baby was born, how magical it is (it wasn’t), lots of questions. At some point she asked me if she could join me &amp; my partner for a check-up because she really wanted to be a part of it. 

I said no &amp; asked her kindly to take a bit of a step back. That her excitement was sweet but a bit too much for us. She did apologise though was upset. I asked her why she wants to be involved so strongly, she didn’t really give an answer. She said she loved me &amp; the baby. And that Jess got to be a part of this a lot more (which is true). 

After she was silent for a bit, but things went back to normal. The last weeks before my due date she came around almost daily but I didn’t want to be ungrateful, plus I was bored at home. They all came often, which I appreciated loads. 

The day I went into labour I was with my partner. I messaged Elisa that she didn’t have to come, Jess that I’d tell her when we left for the hospital &amp; the group something in the lines of ‘This is it, will keep you all posted’. 

Elisa still showed up and apologised, saying she didn’t see the messages. She asked to stay for a bit because of the long drive. 

At some point we decided to go to the hospital though. Elisa said it was too early (could be true, she’s a nurse) but I was feeling in pain and anxious and really just wanted to be there. 

Here’s where it got intense, I guess? She just kinda started acting like she was coming with us. My partner (bless her) told her we got it from here, thanked her for all she did, but that she could go home now. 

Elise replied something along the lines of it was no trouble, she’d love to be there for us &amp; ‘let’s go’, still intent on coming with us. It wasn’t even a question. 

Again my partner now flat out told her we’d prefer it if she went home, but that we’ll message the group to keep everyone posted. Elisa for some reason needed to hear it from me &amp; I said the same thing. That we got it from here, that I’ll keep her post but she should go home. 

She didn’t really move though? She stood there, tearing up, while we grabbed our bags, chargers &amp; so on. I should’ve checked but at that point I couldn’t deal anymore. I got into our car &amp; waited for my partner. 

Elisa came to my window and was full-on crying. She asked me to come with, that it was really important for her. If Jess could be with me, why not she? And so on. 

I’ll admit I didn’t respond kindly. I was anxious and in pain &amp; it’s no excuse. But I shouted at her to leave, to stop being so weird, that it’s not about her &amp; so on. There were some swear words in there.

My partner just drove off with me. 

I haven’t heard from Elisa since (three weeks ago). She has’t come to see the baby, she doesn’t reply in the groupchat &amp; our friends are saying she’s incredibly upset with me, saying she can’t forgive me. I don’t want to mess up our friend group but I’m at a loss. None of us know why she’s behaving this way. The other mom in the group said she was a bit like this when she was pregnant, but not close to the same way she was with me. 

I feel like she overstepped, but I also know I shouldn’t have screamed at her like I did. Do I just apologise try &amp; restore the peace? Do I try to talk to her? Do I give her time to come to me? I’m exhausted &amp; just want this to be resolved.

A little backstory, last month I had the flu, my period, and a UTI (2 antibiotics) all at the same 4 days span, it was exhausting and I was bedridden. I didn't ask him for anything, at the time we were staying at a 5-star all inclusive resort (part of a 2 weeks holiday) and he was spending most of his time with our son.

I don't ask him to do anything for me during my period, but he seems to dislike me expressing any human needs - I said to him he lacks empathy for me, and doesn't view me as a human. He did not deny.

1n5oeze,relationship_advice,My [27F] little brother [22M] joined a Pro Life group for young men. I'm considering cutting ties,"My (27F) little brother (22M) has been struggling with loneliness for years. I've told him that, if he wants to stop being so lonely (and maybe get a gf), he needs to actually do something with his life; stop playing video games/watching anime/vaping in his room; try to better himself as a person; and actually go outside and connect with people. Get healthy hobbies, go volunteer!

Instead, he recently found meaning in the church. It is unfortunately a very right-wing church, and he has become very passionate about it. (Our family grew up lightly Christian, but drifted away from religion over time.)

His pastor told him they've seen a new phenomenon: Lots of young men like my brother are joining the church, more than ever before (especially from nearby universities), and the church is very excited about it. They want to organize them for something meaningful. 

A few of those churches in the area have put together a group of young men (mostly college-aged) to ""defend the unborn."" They're going to protest outside of providers as a big group.

My brother says these young males just want to ""make their voices heard."" But to me it sounds like an intimidation tactic against vulnerable women. I'm livid. 

I feel like I don't want to support or have someone in my life who does that. I know different politics can coexist, but this one is a red line for me (for some deeply, deeply personal reasons). Nuclear options available. Do I cut ties? How do I handle this? Any advice would be appreciated.

1jvh0pw,relationship_advice,How do I (23F) tell my BF(25M) that I don’t want to have sex with him anymore?,"How do I (23F) tell my boyfriend (25M) that I don’t like having sex with him anymore?

So my (23F) bf (25M) has a very high sex drive. I do not… anymore. When we met I was a virgin and after our first time, we went kinda crazy. I’m talking 4-5 times a day, 3-4 days a week. We were constantly talking about it and touching and teasing each other. You know, the honeymoon phase. And I thought he was good about taking care of me but looking back, he would only go down on me for short periods before “giving up” and he said it was too hard to rub my cl*t while having sex. 

Those should’ve been the only red flags I needed but alas, we’ve been together for a year now. My drive has slowed a LOT, like, I prefer maybe once or twice a week. He constantly complains about us not having sex enough. When we do, it is imperative that I go down on him, if I express that I don’t feel like it, he gets huffy and puffy and makes me feel bad until I finally give in. 

A few weeks ago, he held my head to make me keep going after he finished and literally pissed in my mouth instead of finishing a second time. Afterwards I told him I didn’t want to do that again (i literally threw up) and made it obvious I wasnt in the mood to continue. But again, he guilted me into having sex with him to make him feel like he was “normal.” Just a few days ago, it happened again, but I stood my ground about not continuing and he got very upset and wouldnt speak to me for the rest of the evening. 

On top of that, he never goes down on me anymore. We have a toy for me but he complains that he can’t finish if we use it, and makes me feel awkward because I have to ask if we can, he doesnt bring it up himself. He also complains a TON when I ask him to use a condom, usually until I give in again. We do whatever position he wants, for however long he wants, and once he’s done, it’s over, he goes and showers and then goes to sleep. 

All of this is making me not want to engage in any sexual activity with him anymore. I’ve tried multiple times to talk to him about it what I need and he apologizes but doesnt change his behavior. I haven’t straight up told him I don’t want to anymore and I don’t know if that is even worth it. In addition to some other things, I’m starting to think this could be a reason to break up. 

Hopefully this makes sense, any and all advice is appreciated &lt;3

ETA: 
yes, pissed in my mouth. he said after that it was an accident and that he thought he was going to cum again. the second time, i asked him if he had finished (surprisingly i couldnt tell) he said no and pushed my head back down, and then did it again, again saying it was an accident and he didnt even realize 

ill address more comments in the morning, i appreciate all the support &amp; YES i am making a plan to break up with him! 

Edit 2: First of all, again, I appreciate the support, harsh or not. 
Second, after a long chat with my therapist yesterday, we came to the conclusion that he has been mentally/emotionally abusing and manipulating me for a long time in a lot of different ways. the responses to this post gave me enough confidence to tell her about this abuse as well. And we are working on a plan to process it all. BF and I live together (worst decision ive made i know) so I am planning on silently packing my stuff this weekend and getting out. 
Third, about the piss. I’m going to continue to mention that this is my FIRST sexual partner. How am I supposed to know it’s not natural, especially after googling it and seeing that it can happen? He acted embarrassed after so I just did what I could to comfort him while expressing I didnt like it and dont want to do it again. Also, luckily I could tell the difference between the feeling of it and cum, so I didnt swallow it, just fyi. 
Finally, those of you saying things about “why do women” shut up. why do men? why does this man that i thought loved me choose to constantly manipulate, abuse, and degrade me? why isnt HE normal? i grew up with a narcissistic mother and it, by default, makes me more susceptible to falling for a partner with the same tendencies. It’s not a choice, it’s truly what I believe(d) that I deserve. I AM working on it, and this plan to leave is the first step. dont blame me for what he is doing to me, or say women in general are weak for staying in a situation that you have never endured, therefore know nothing about. i’ll try to update when i am safely away, thanks again",2921,0.95,2921,0,3083.0,162.0,806,1744233325.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jvh0pw/how_do_i_23f_tell_my_bf25m_that_i_dont_want_to/,False,True

My (M37) wife (F38) was recently offered a position at a major corporation in California. She’s currently working as a chemical engineer in Dublin, earning a very competitive salary. The only catch, at least for my wife, is that there’s little to no room for professional growth in her current job because she’s already reached the highest position available in her department.

A few months ago, she mentioned looking around for a new job as she was feeling really burnt out with her present role. As her husband, of course I wholeheartedly supported her. She never really mentioned anything about US, or that she was even applying to a position in California.

Now, ever since she received her offer a few days ago, she’s been really happy and excited about possibly moving there. Despite my concerns,I’ve been very supportive because I did not want her to think that I’m not happy for her. Because I am. But I really don’t want to move to US.

My wife and I are originally from the Philippines. We have two little girls who were born here in Ireland. The eldest will be starting primary school this year and I worry that if we ever move, she will have a hard time adjusting to a completely different country. In addition, with the current political climate, I’m scared that she might be bullied for being an immigrant. Not that it can’t happen here, but the chances of it happening in US is more likely.

Our parents also frequently visits us here from the Philippines and they get to be present in our children’s lives. But again, with its current political climate, if we move to US, it might be difficult for our parents’ to apply for a tourist visa and fly in to visit us.

My wife is really happy and it fills me with joy seeing how excited she is especially after hearing her complain about how unfulfilling her current job is for months on end. But I honestly don’t think moving our family to the United States is the move. How do I tell her this without sounding like an unsupportive husband?",2911,0.95,2911,0,3073.0,162.0,888,1749438843.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l6ui7h/how_do_i_m37_tell_my_wife_f38_that_i_dont_want_to/,False,True
1jcsizd,relationship_advice,"My wife [34F] is spiraling and I [36M] am tired of covering for her. I need her to get her weight under control, but we've been down this road before and it always eventually falls apart. How can I help her see I'm serious and salvage this?","Before I get started, I want to make one thing clear: I love my wife. She's the mother of my two children, she's intelligent and funny, and I have always been and remain attracted to her. She's always been heavier since we first met, and I've never had a problem with that except insofar as it effects our family's quality of life, as I'll explain below.

For some background, we have been married for nine years and she has steadily gained weight over the course of our marriage. This was particularly exacerbated by a difficult pregnancy, which was immediately followed by the COVID lockdowns and her losing her long-term job. Things continued to get out of hand until early last year, when some incidents finally convinced her to see a doctor and get control of things. Her weight was well over 500 lbs, and her doctor prescribed her Zepbound and recommended she start seeing a therapist. This worked fairly well for a while, (though she almost immediately quit therapy), and by the end of last summer she had lost over 20 lbs. She had also generally improved her outlook, gotten a part-time job, and was much more active. We loved taking walks together.

Things took a turn for the worse in two ways last fall: first, my job switched insurance plans to one that didn't cover glp-1s for weight loss, and second, a family member passed away pretty suddenly, which caused her a lot of grief and stress. She was home from work for about a month on bereavement after the passing, and at the same time her binge eating, which had been suppressed by Zepbound, returned with a fury. This bled into the Holidays, which are obviously not good for anyone's waistline, and this year she's basically fallen back into all of her old habits. I don't know her current weight, but she's definitely gained back everything she lost plus some.

Here's where the advice portion starts: I've had to start adjusting my life in a lot of ways to accommodate her limitations, and the list grows longer every week. While by no means exhaustive, the list includes:

* She is unable to put on socks or shoes or trim her toenails on her own.
* Always needs my help getting up from our sofa, which is pretty low, or from playing with the kids on the floor
* I have to drive her to work and the kids to school despite working from home myself, because she is too big to safely fit behind the wheel
* When friends invite us out, I have to make excuses to cancel plans and lie to them to avoid admitting things like, ""no we can't come because she can't stand up for that long"". Our social life is in the tank
* Our romantic life sucks. Basically all dates are staying in to get takeout and watch a movie, because she gets anxious about restaurants, can't fit in movie theaters, and can't do most things that involve physical activity
* Most weekdays when she isn't working she barely leaves bed, leaving me to work full-time and do all of the child-care at the same time once they're home from school.
* Grocery shopping is a nightmare because she can't really stay standing for long enough, but is too proud to use one of the store scooters, so she stays in the car and calls me on my air-pods and tells me what to get. And if I refuse her anything, suddenly I'm being manipulative or insulting her weight. The whole thing makes me feel like a drug dealer or something.

Every week on Sunday she basically hypes herself up about how this will be the week to turn everything around, but then she never changes anything. And if I remind her of what she said and try to curb her eating choices I'm ""not being helpful"". I'm honestly getting really sick of all this and feel close to snapping. To top everything off, my job was partially funded by federal grant money, so as of two weeks ago I'm unemployed and looking for work. I can't handle everything that I'm being asked to do and the stress is killing me to the point I frequently fantasize about running away, just booking a plane ticket and leaving her to deal with things for a weekend. I would never actually do that, but it makes me feel like a terrible husband and father to even have those thoughts. I feel like I'm living in a loop of broken promises and plans every week and I don't know how to get it to stick. Obviously I will be heavily considering the health insurance plan for wherever I look into working next, as glp-1s have been the only thing to really help so far.

How can I show her how much I'm hurting without looking shallow or selfish? How can I get one of her diet attempts to stick while we wait for another opportunity to get on drugs? For the foreseeable future I'm going to have to keep doing extra, because she can't physically help right now with a lot of things, but I need a plan and an end in sight or I'm gonna go nuts.",2902,0.95,2902,0,3063.0,161.0,736,1742150814.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jcsizd/my_wife_34f_is_spiraling_and_i_36m_am_tired_of/,False,True
1jqshdt,relationship_advice,I (24F) blacked out and slept with a C-suite executive (51M) at work and I have no idea how to proceed. I’ve never done anything like this,"UPDATE: Hotel said they can not give me CCTV without a subpoena 

Please don’t just tell me I fucked up by drinking. I know I did. Don’t beat a dead horse. I usually don’t drink at work and everyone else does and this time I think it was a combination of a bit of peer pressure and the fact that I’m going through a lot in my personal life. I will never drink at work again. I’m an idiot, I get it. 

EDIT: I am nearly certain I was not drugged but I’ll get a test. I drank a lot…. I just don’t know how to interact with him moving forward any advice on that would be appreciated 

I work in a bit of a boys club environment where everyone goes out after big meetings and gets trashed. I’m the youngest by a long shot and was hired because I wrote an influential paper that got a lot of traction. Everyone else is married or divorced. I have NEVER slept with a coworker, and this is the first “one night stand” I’ve had in 4-5 years. I’m not this person. 

I haven’t spoken much or spent much time around this guy, but he’s a c suite executive at my work. We went out and I don’t even remember talking much to him. I talked to another friend of mine. The next day I asked my coworker (48M, friendly) how it was and said the last thing I remember is sitting and talking with you and he said yeah it was obvious you got too drunk and you were kinda quiet and ready to go home. We all went back to the hotel and you sort of disappeared after that. 

I have NO RECOLLECTION of coming back to the hotel, NO RECOLLECTION of talking to this guy at the bars- only before trying to get to know him a bit. I don’t know if I initiated it, but that would be out of character. He’s got a wife and kids. I was wearing a shirt that is difficult to unbutton sober, but I woke up in my own bed with it off. It seems like based on text records that this occurred maybe 3am or so. 

The next day c suite executive calls me and says I left something in his room. He says be sure that I don’t text him about this call him tell him how good it was or anything because he can’t ruin his relationship with his wife. He said this all has to be kept a secret. He said he will discreetly give me back my item the next time we see eachother later this month. 

WHAT THE HELL DO I DO???? Part of me wants to ask him what happened. I’m dying to know- I can’t stop thinking about it. How did I get to his room? How did I get back to mine? Who initiated? Did I fall asleep? Was I active or did I just lay there? Did he finish? Where? I have so many questions…. 

I understand that this could be assault, but I don’t really want to move forward with HR etc because what if I initiated it? I don’t want to ruin his life and I don’t want to ruin my reputation. I don’t want anyone else to know. What if he hates me after this and seeks to ruin me or doesn’t see me as worth anything professionally? 

I think it will be easy to keep this quiet and sweep it under the rug, but I don’t know how to interact with him. Is it a bad idea to ask him what happened and all those other questions? I am mostly just embarrassed and sad that I don’t know what happened but I don’t feel violated. If anything, taken advantage of due to the fact that he’s over twice my age, has more $ and power than I ever will, and clearly wasn’t as drunk as I was. But it doesn’t feel like this was some evil thing he did on purpose. 

I know I wouldn’t have made that choice sober, but there’s no evidence of violence or force so it’s impossible to say what happened. Legally in my country I know this is assault/illegal. I was trying to get to know him a bit at the meeting way before the drinking- since we have never spoken and he is influential in our industry so maybe he mistook it as flirting. 

I just don’t know how to minimize the impact of this event on my life. I don’t know how to interact with him moving forward, I don’t know if I should pretend it never happened or ask for more info from him or tell him I was upset by this….

1hlgsyz,relationship_advice,"I, 35M am planning to tell my wife (37f) that I want a divorce at our next couples therapy session. Have I wasted a decade of our lives?","We have been married for 4 years and have been together for almost a decade. She has a lot of stress from her job and trauma from her family and past relationships but she is happy  with our marriage and I'm miserable.

For context, it took me two years of asking for her to agree to go to couples counseling in the first place and we've been in therapy, together and alone, for almost two more years. She knows I'm miserable, she knows I'm depressed, but she has put in so little effort to make any changes that I'm just done. I'm sad all the time and she knows that, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.

Our therapist knows about my plan. When I told her she said that she was a little surprised that I had held on so long with nothing changing or improving. Obviously she didn't tell me about their individual sessions but she did say that nothing in any of our sessions, couples or individual, led her to believe that I was making unreasonable requests or ignoring what she wanted.

Our love languages are different and I know that, but mine never get addressed. I crave physical touch (not just intimacy) and want her to say kind things about me, the way I do with her all the time. Her languages, quality time and gift giving, have taken precedent and I honestly love buying her things she wants. I have the money and I love seeing her face when she gets something she's had her eye on.

With regards to intimacy, I do everything. Literally everything in bed to get both of us off but I get touched so infrequently that I feel there must be something wrong with me.

I just... I know this is going to crush her but I can't do this any more. I don't even know what I'm looking for here. To vent? To get some assurance that I'm not a horrible person? I feel like I'm ruining her life and  throwing away a decade of our lives. She also doesn't have the same support net that I do, her family lives in Dallas (and her mom and dad have never been very warm or comforting) which is also making me feel worse about this decision.",2870,0.96,2870,0,2995.0,125.0,541,1735057083.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hlgsyz/i_35m_am_planning_to_tell_my_wife_37f_that_i_want/,False,True
1hso2op,relationship_advice,"I (28F) found out my boyfriend (29M) is planning a surprise proposal for me, and I think it is now cancelled after he met with my father. How do I address this without revealing I already sort of knew?","So, over the past two months my boyfriend was acting weird and a little sneaky. Around 1 month after, I accidentally found out that my boyfriend had contacted my two best friends to help plan a proposal and already bought a ring. I also found out that he took my mom out for lunch to discuss this with her. My sister also slipped a little and made it more obvious. I knew it was supposed to happen this February but did not know the date.

I already know that I did too much detective work and should not have found this out, and this is completely my fault. So last week my friend randomly texts me that she saw my boyfriend at a coffee shop, and he did not recognize her, and she was saying it as a joke, but she casually mentioned that he was with my dad (she does not know the dynamic of the relationship and that they had not met before). I have always mentioned that I would love to have my parents blessing before a proposal etc, and I know many don't agree but it is still common in the South and especially in my family and this is also my personal preference.

The same day, I called my boyfriend just for a chat and he sounded a little off, so I asked if he's okay and how his is day going but did not reveal that I knew he met my dad. He said that ""It could be better"" and said work was a little overwhelming and he needs to work harder to get into a better position at work as his job is not very stable etc, and he said that would make it easier if at some point this year, I introduce myself to your dad it would be better etc. Again, he did not know I already knew. He also said that if he was a dad he would want his daughter to be stable and with someone worthy etc.

I did not know what to say but 1 am heartbroken. Does this mean the meeting didn't go well? I guessed he did not get my father's blessing, and now I don't know how to feel. 1. I was excited for something that is most likely not going to happen soon anymore (which is my fault). 2. I do not like that this happened, and I cannot discuss it with him or make him feel better. What is the best way to address this?

CONTEXT: I come from a well-off family, very educated etc. My boyfriend comes from a poor family, but he is kind, caring, hardworking, reliable and so so loving.

TO ADDRESS THE COMMENTS TALKING ABOUT ME NOT INTRODUCING THEM: My boyfriend has met my mother and all my siblings, they have known him for the past two years and love him. My father knew about him, I have talked about him and my father does not live with us. It was never a secret relationship.

UPDATE: First of all, I want to say thank you to all those who commented to help out or to provide advice/constructive criticism. It is very easy to make assumptions about people's lives, so thank you for not doing that. After reading through your comments I decided to address this issue with my boyfriend as it would be best for our relationship moving forward. I was very honest and told him that I was very suspicious, and people slipped so I knew that he was planning something and meeting with my family. I thanked him for that and for all the thought and effort he put, and I made it clear I do not know exactly what he planned but I appreciate it. I also told him that after our conversation about my father, I was worried about him and what he believed he needed to be for this to work. Apparently, I was overthinking it. So here is what I found out:

1. My boyfriend said that I made it clear that I would like my father's blessing and not necessarily permission.
2. My father did not say no, and did not say yes. The conversation steered away from me and more into the financial aspects of life, and responsibility, implying that he has a lot of work to do and a lot of things to achieve to be able to lead a stable life. My boyfriend took that as constructive criticism and did not wait for him to say yes about the proposal. As someone mentioned in the comments he said, these are all things we can work on overtime, together.
3. My boyfriend did see my friend at the coffee shop, and already had a feeling I knew but did not think I would overthink it this much. He said he did not mind because the surprise is more about how he will be proposing and not that he will be. At this point I think he was more excited than I am.

Now, what I learned from this is that I need to work on my decision-making skills and communication skills. I decided to overthink things, and to worry about minor things in comparison to how important my relationship is to me. I think what I will do for now is continue supporting my boyfriend and reminding him that he is capable. As for my father, I will have a conversation with him once I get the chance. I think it would be healthy to discuss this with him and set some expectations and boundaries.

Update: We are engaged. We are happy. All is good. What I learned: I need to stop overthinking. I need to set boundaries even with family.

1ikzhbo,relationship_advice,How do I (31f) handle my husbands (36m) Super Bowl party,"

My (31f) husband (36m) and I are supposed to be having a Super Bowl party tomorrow. We have been in a fight for weeks, and he invited people while we were fighting. I have no idea how many he invited (or the guest list). Most of “our friends” all stem from his friend group. I only invited 1 friend and her husband. 

I’ve asked him if he coordinated for people to bring shareables/contributions. Doesn’t answer. I ask him how many and who is coming. Doesn’t answer. I ask him what time people are coming. Doesn’t answer. 

He’s not the kind of person that plays host well, that always falls on me. He doesn’t think about making sure people are fed and have drinks, etc. it’s the night before and we have nothing in our fridge to suggest we have food to heat up or make. No beverages to get us through a party. 

How do I handle this situation? On one hand I’m tempted to let this party be a disaster but on the other hand I’ll be embarrassed if it is. 

Update: I had the courage to ask one of his best buddies if my husband told anyone to bring contributions and he said no. 

2nd update additional info - his friends all have wives that I am friends with. Half of them have kids. I don’t know who’s coming but I can’t bank on it just being a “guys party.” 


UPDATE: First, thank you everyone for the support and advice. I truly did not think I’d have the tiniest fraction of a response as I did. It was a lot to take in. And the comments/conversation started taking an even deeper turn I wasn’t prepared to address. I know my update will be disappointing for a lot of people but here it is. 

Yesterday morning, my husband spoke zero words to me until his buddy (the one I had the courage to text the day before) called him late in the morning to ask what was going on/the plan. I think he partially did it cuz even “the guys” don’t like going into such a party with no game plan and also I think he could read between the lines of my text/desperation the day prior and was trying to light a fire under my husbands ass. After that all of a sudden my husband was motivated to do stuff and trying to confirm heads counts 🥴 ultimately only his 1 buddy and his wife showed up. And then my 2 friends. For reference last year when I organized the Super Bowl party we had 30+ people attend. So that’s what I was initially expecting. Can’t say for sure what caused such a huge difference in turnout but likely all our friends could tell there was zero planning and didn’t want to partake in an important event so unorganized. Knowing half the “party” was now my friends, I decided to step in. We went to the store together and grabbed necessities. He acted like all was normal the whole rest of the day. Flash forward to today, he isn’t giving me the silent treatment anymore but it’s certainly tense, not enjoyable conversation. No I didn’t get any thank you, jokes. 

I can understand why everyone wanted me to leave for the party, maybe I’m a push over but when you are in these situations where standing up for yourself is ridiculed as being “vindictive” you start walking on eggshells more and doing what you can to prevent arguments. Also disclaimer, we are Eagles fans…so for my sake I did not want to preemptively put a damper on my evening in case there would be a positive outcome to the game. Again thank you everyone, and I am sorry my update isn’t “juicer.” 

Update 2/19 &amp; mass inquiry: first of all I have scheduled regular meetings with a therapist (individual cuz husband won’t do couples therapy). My first session is next week to try to work through this. But I have a mass inquiry for anyone following this post. Everyone keeps telling me my husband doesn’t even like me or doesn’t love me, fair I can understand that and even think that myself. What I have a hard time understanding is why marry me, but us a house, push to have children if this is the case? I’m not doubting everyone’s opinions I genuinely want to understand why someone would go through all that.

1msxwse,relationship_advice,My (32F) husband (36M) staged an intervention after I told him I wanted a divorce,"I (32F) have been married to my husband (36M) for 6 years. It's my first serious relationship. I love him, he's funny, charming and intelligent and we share a lot, but he has always been a little hot headed.

Some context first: a few months ago, a situation at work went badly and I fell into the burnout. I’m autistic, and the burnout has made my executive dysfunction much worse. I’ve been on sick leave ever since.

I have very little energy. Even basic things leave me exhausted. I sleep a lot, socialize very little, skip meals. I know it's bad but I am doing my best.

My husband has been very frustrated that I’m not respecting his needs. We don't haev sex, I don’t cook every day, and the house isn’t as tidy as he’d like.

Multiple times, I didn't take care of things while he was at work so he yelled at me. others, I made him ignore me for hours. I tried to explain that I was struggling too much and he replied that I was using my situation and exaggerating my symptoms for attention.

I tried to push myself to meet his needs and keep up with the house, but every time I quickly got too tired and had to stop. I tried to tell him but said he didn't want to hear it because he has enough on his plate.

I never know if I am going to make him angry. I have been crying almost every day and I don't know if it's the burnout or if it's because I can't be there for him. I felt like it would be better for both of us to take a break. He refused and said thdt as his wife, it was my legal duty to be there in sickness and in health.

Two weeks ago, I finally told him I wanted a divorce. He had a meltdown and he yelled for hours, saying I was just confused because of my mental health. he apologized later and said I shouldn't act irrational like that. I hesitated for a few days and I told him I still wanted to leave, amd he had another meltdwn.

Yesterday, I woke up and went downstairs to find my husband, his parents, and my parents, all waiting for me.

They said they were extremely worried, that they never get news except from my husband. He reported to them he was scared for me because I was isolating and harming myself.

They told me it was okay to need help. That I needed stability. They said they were all there for me no matter what. I cried the entire time. I felt cornered, humiliated, and defensive. I felt like that was not normal. But now I don’t know what to think.

After they left he said he contacted my GP and psychologist to let them know how bad it is, and booked an appointment with a psychiatrist on my behalf. He said they all care about me and want to help me be myself again.

Part of me still wants to leave, but another part of me wonders if they’re right. I still love him. And I’m definitely not at my most stable right now, I am in the fog. to be honest I feel really selfish and guilty about all of this. I am completely overwhelmed.

Could  you guys give me an outside perspective on this?

Thanks a lot.

  
EDIT: thanks everyone, so many replies, I am grateful. I can't answer everyone right now but I can give a few thoughts and infos:

* I see my GP every two weeks. I was on Cipralex but we had to stop becaus of side effects, now we are trying mirtazapine. I had already seen a therapist before a few years ago and my husband called her and my GP  yesterday to tell them I needed help before bookng the appointment with the psychiatrist he found. I'll go to the appointments and give them my perspective.
* I have an ok relationship with my parents, they see me as fragile and don't always understand the autism. I think I will try to talk with tehm about what was going on and ask if I can stay with them temporarily. and get better before deciding on the divorce.

I'll rest for now, this is a lot to take in. Thanks everyone.",2799,0.95,2799,0,2955.0,156.0,849,1755453817.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1msxwse/my_32f_husband_36m_staged_an_intervention_after_i/,False,True
1ippftj,relationship_advice,"Update to my (45M) situation regarding finding my wife’s (44F) troll account  laughing at a murdered child, how do I proceed?","
Hi everyone,
I want to thank all those that reached out to me and checked in me over the last days. I really appreciated it. I couldn’t air this stuff out to friends and family before getting to the bottom of it so your support and advice is really appreciated. I’m sorry if some of what I say doesn’t make sense as I’m on the bottle right now and pretty emotional right now. 

original post is no longer available so here’s a short summary of it 

TLDR; I found my wife’s (married 8 yrs)  troll account on Reddit, long story short she was trolling and laughing at a dead kid. Comments involve  this kids weight and other horrible shit. Judging by her comment history, she has been at it for a long time,, and seems to be heavily involved in some niche true crime communities 

Update -
I screenshotted everything I could find. When she came home from work I sat her  down and gave my phone to her and asked her to scroll through the screenshots. I told myself that I’ll give her exactly 30 minutes to explain this without interjection from myself. I did this  to first gage her thought process on whyshe would say and do these things, but also to see if she would defend the screenshots. 

It didn’t go well. She spent 10 mins trying to find online videos for proof of her theory. She said I was uneducated and that had a narrow view on true crime and have been sucked into mainstream propaganda and that this murdered family had a lot going on that the public doesn’t know. completely batshit insane points of course but there we go. Not only is the love of my life a troll, she’s also a full blown conspiracy theorist. 
For the sake of our marriage and our boys. I tried to reason with her but she doubled down. I begged her to delete reddit and to seek help for these delusions. I even reported her account in hopes Reddit will ban. 

That was some days ago, as of now I’ve shed many tears and have drunk myself to an obliteration since, We have gone round and round in circles over this. Despite my post been taken down she found my previous post and is refusing civil dialogue with me.I made a point that what she wrote about that child and mother is way worse then me turning to reddit, but she doesn’t see it that way. The only single time she’s reached out in a civil manner was via email and she sent me some documents on the murder to change my mind. We usually can talk things out, we have been close to a separation before, but that was over demographic stuff (she wanted to move states and I didn’t). I don’t know if we can fix such a fundamental difference in morality. 

I’ve gone to a friends for a few days. They have been supportive, and also shocked at what’s gone down, but they know my wife well and are sympathetic to the situation. They have hooked me up with an online community that offers support for those dealing with conspiracy theories which I’m going to join soon. Our extended family has some external drama going on and I think that has something to do with my wife acting like this. Thankfully my wife and I are on one agreement, to protect the kids from this. Despite all this she is a good mother and wants what’s best for our sons. The kids know something has gone down but not details. 

I was in two minds of providing an update, largely because it clearly hurt my wife, and this update will probably fuel the fire even more. But fuck it, it makes no difference, there’s no coming back from this even with her acknowledging the harm and damage she is caused. I hope she reads every reddit comment on how insane all of this is. I hope it gives a lesson to anyone out there,   please   check in on what your partner is into for content. 

I know a lot of the discussion in my previous post was surrounding true crime. I’m not going to get into it, lbut out of respect for the murdered victims and tol, please.  don’t mention any communities you think are connected to my wife. Don’t let it ruin your day like it did my marriage. Thanks reddit.

1opza4g,relationship_advice,I F32 want to break up with my boyfriend M54 for a younger guy.,"For the sake of protecting both our identities, I’ll refer to my boyfriend as John (not his real name).  

John and I met at work. He was my office manager for several years. About three years ago, I went through a really rough breakup with my ex, and my mental state was very poor. John could see how upset I was at work, even though I did my best to leave it at home. I didn’t really want to be the latest office gossip, so when he started offering his office for me to work in private, I was super grateful. Sometimes he would also be there, but he was often needed elsewhere, so I wasn’t too concerned about the other type of gossip forming.  

Over time, John and I grew a close bond, and after a few months we started going out for drinks and food. I guess you could say we began dating. The age thing was always in the back of my mind, but those first few months were really good, so I didn’t think too much of it. He was kind, funny, caring, and just seemed like a really great guy.  

After several months of dating, John made the decision to transfer offices to avoid any conflict of interest or potential problems with the company. Not long after, we moved in together.  

That’s when the problems started to reveal themselves. At first, it was small, stupid things like he’d insist I stop watching my favourite TV shows because they were “childish and stupid.” I would laugh and say he didn’t get it because he’s old, and we’d make a joke of it. The thing is, though, he wasn’t joking. This became a constant thing, and it began to weigh on me until I decided to just stop watching.  

Next up was my clothing choices. He accused me of dressing like I was in my 20s, like I was wanting to attract a young guy. So I started dressing older and more “appropriately.”  

He started making me feel bad about my friends, accusing them of being childish and boring. He would go out of his way to ask them questions about philosophy and politics and then berate them for not knowing the answers. My friends confessed they didn’t like being around him because he made them feel belittled, which is exactly how he often makes me feel. I hardly see them anymore, but I don’t blame them for wanting to distance themselves.  

I used to have a lot of independence in my life,  hobbies, friends, and fun. Now it seems all I ever really do is what John wants to do, most of which are things I find absolutely mind-numbingly dull.  

Whenever I push back and try to do what I want, he’ll shut me down, making me feel tiny and stupid for suggesting it, often using his age as a way to say, “I know better than you.”  

And that’s been my life for the past couple of years up until recently. Enter Mark (again, not his real name), the new guy at work who’s incredibly fun to be around. He has amazing energy, charisma, and bundles of charm. He and I get on like a house on fire. We share a lot of the same hobbies, he’s only a couple of years older than me, and he makes me laugh in ways I haven’t laughed since I was a kid..  the kind of goofy, uncontrollable laughter that makes your sides hurt. I find myself thinking about Mark a lot. I look forward to going to work to hang out with him. I get butterflies in my belly when I’m around him, and I feel a genuine warmth when I’m with him.  

To be clear, nothing romantic has happened between Mark and me, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want it to.  

John was there for me when I really needed someone, maybe I'm the problem for not strongly advocating for myself? I've always been a people pleaser. Ergh. I can’t even tell what’s real anymore. If I'm being selfish, or childish, or getting swept up in the fantasy of it all. 

I could really use some advice here. 


Edit: ** Thank you for all your advice. I realise now that my problems with codependency and the fear of being alone pushes me into these unhealthy situations. I will be ending my relationship with John, but Mark and I will remain nothing more than colleagues and friends for the foreseeable. I need to learn how to be comfortable being on my own and rediscover myself before I consider entering any new relationship. **",2769,0.92,2769,0,3033.0,264.0,449,1762436643.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1opza4g/i_f32_want_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_m54_for/,False,True
1ise31d,relationship_advice,Update: My (25f) parents have chased away every boyfriend I have ever had. How do I prevent this from ruining my relationship with my current bf (28m)?,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1ioawyj/my\_25f\_parents\_have\_chased\_away\_every\_boyfriend\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ioawyj/my_25f_parents_have_chased_away_every_boyfriend_i/)

I meant to make this update a lot sooner, but since my last post a lot has happened. I truly appreciate all the comments I received calling me out for hiding my parents being insane from my bf and encouraging me to be honest with him. My bf is pretty involved now, so I guess I should give him a (fake) name. I will call him Ethan.

I sat Ethan down and told him about my parents and how they ran off my previous boyfriends, before showing him my original post as many recommended. Fortunately, he did not seem to care that I hadn't told him, but he did agree with many commenters that my parents were more than just insane- they were outright abusive. Although he understood how I felt, he still said he would like to meet them, both to see it for himself, but also because he felt there was an underlying reason for their behavior. My parents have dinner for the family every Sunday, which I have been attending on the weeks that I'm not hanging out with Ethan that day, so we agreed that he would come to the next one.

When Sunday came and we arrived at my parent's house, my anxiety was through the roof. Ethan had agreed to leave with me the moment things started to get out of hand, but with my parents that could have easily been as soon we walked through the front door. My parents were surprisingly very nice, though. My dad actually seemed excited to see Ethan, and my mom fawned over her daughter bringing home such a handsome, confident looking man. I couldn't understand what was happening. Ethan even shot me a look a couple times, as if to silently ask if I he was missing something, because my parents were actually lovely. I want to provide a play by play of the entire night, but the post would just be too long. The point is, my parents had done a complete 180 from their previous behavior, and it made me look and feel crazy for trying to warn Ethan about them ahead of time.

During dinner, my mom said she was so happy to see her daughter had finally found someone who wasn't judgmental and was willing to give me a chance because of the person I am today, because the past doesn't matter. My heart dropped- what was she talking about? Ethan said he does not know about anything in my past that may be cause of concern, and my parents exchanged a concerned look, as if it was rehearsed. My dad asked him why he thinks my previous relationships failed, and he said that he was under the impression they got scared away after meeting my parents. My mother looked at me with disappointment on her face and said ""OP... is that really what you told him?"" I was at a loss for words, but Ethan was not.

He said that it's pretty clear they are trying to plant seeds of doubt in him about our relationship, but he is not interested, as he knows me well enough to know my character and that even if there was something serious in my past, parents who loved and supported me or even just wanted grandchildren would keep it a secret to avoid ruining my relationship. My dad said he already has two grandchildren, and motioned towards my sister, (who did not have her kids with her that evening). Ethan said my dad must have been very supportive of my sister for her to be able to start a family while he tries to run off any guy I bring home, and my dad's response was very casual, but extremely shocking. He said ""Of course, she's actually mine.""

Everyone was quiet for a few moments, until Ethan spoke up and said that now all of the abuse they've only put me through is starting to make sense. My mom said he's spouting nonsense, and that I have not been abused in any way. She then looked at me and admitted her marriage had a ""rocky start"", but both her and my father have moved past that. I was too busy replaying my entire life in my head to say anything. The previous boyfriends, the lack of support for my social outings growing up, the volleyball games I had to have a friend drive me to because my ""parents"" were always too busy, the rage I was always at risk of facing if I ever spoke my mind... all while my sister got the opposite. I started to cry, the hardest I ever have.

Ethan immediately announced that we are leaving. My dad demanded we stay where we are so we can clear things up, but Ethan ignored him as he pulled me out of my chair and led me away. My mom screamed at me not to leave, and that this guy was trying to isolate me from my family. I yelled back that if anyone had been trying to isolate me, it was her, for my whole life.

As we drove back to Ethan's place, my mom sent me several text messages cussing me out, saying one mistake doesn't change the fact that my dad loved, supported, and raised me, and that he would always be my real father. Ethan said he's not my dad, he's an abusive, controlling asshole who was taking his insecurities out on me. I ended up blocking both of my parents' numbers because they were saying some truly awful things to me, both about myself and Ethan. Ethan said he was expecting them to be crazy, but this was far worse than he could have anticipated. He said I need to go into therapy immediately, and that he will pay for anything my insurance doesn't cover. My parents showed up at my apartment twice yesterday to demand I come out and speak to them, but I've been staying at Ethan's all weekend and will likely be here all week.

I'm not sure if this is the update y'all wanted. I had countless people enraged at me for being spineless and not standing up to my parents, and while I had planned on doing so... that's not what happened. I don't know what is going to happen with my parents, or where I go from here... but now that the holiday is over I can spend some time looking for a good therapist.

1ira9ds,relationship_advice,Heart was drawn inside Fiance’s (27M) car window and I (25F) questioned him about it,"Fiancé went out with his friends the other night and didn’t get home till 4 in the morning. I was upset but he apologized and we moved forward. Today, he takes me out to dinner and while in his car I notice there’s a heart drawn on the inside of his front windshield. I ask him who’s been in his car! At first he says no one and that he thought I drew that in the car .. I’m 7 months pregnant and wouldn’t lean forward to reach his front windshield to draw a f-ing heart.. then he proceeds to say oh him and his friend drove these 2 girls to their car after they left the bar and the girl must’ve drawn the heart, but all he did was take them to their car…. 
Does this not sound like BS? Why are women in your car? And if you were simply dropping them off, why is your homeboy in the back with the other girl? I had to get space from him so that I don’t spazz out . Advice anyone! 

EDIT: Thanks for everyone’s input. I know everyone is saying to leave and that he cheated.. but honestly, how do I make a decision like that when we live together, baby’s room is here, I’m due in less than 3 months, baby shower is in 2 weeks.. and I have no family here 😭 I’m in Atlanta, my family is in New York City. I don’t have hardcore proof that he cheated.. lied yes! And I’ve told him that I know he is lying and giving me a half truth but he’s insisting that nothing occurred and that he should’ve just been upfront but he didn’t even think about them being in his car when I initially asked.. which is still bullshit to me. He doesn’t go out often so him having a night out with his friends was ok with me, but staying out till 4 was the issue. I just don’t know how to move forward..

I’m out to myself and some close friends, but definitely not to my parents. They’ve been on my case about getting married, and despite my constant dodging, they finally set up a meeting without really asking me. I knew resisting too hard would just raise suspicion, so I went along with it, hoping to find a way out later.

The whole experience was… surreal. The girl was actually really sweet. I think she sensed my discomfort because she kept the conversation light and even joked about how weird the whole arranged marriage process is. I couldn’t help but wonder if she was also being pressured into this.

Meanwhile, our parents were busy discussing horoscopes, family backgrounds, and future plans—completely oblivious to the fact that I had zero interest in this marriage, or any marriage with a woman for that matter.

1ljsjt7,relationship_advice,My husband (32M) left me (32F) after almost 15 years together and wants me to forget and let him come home. What are my next steps to stop that?,"My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years, but together for almost 15. He is my only long real boyfriend I have had in my adult life, and we have 2 children together.

We have had a rocky relationship from the beginning if I’m being honest, but the last 3 years have, for the most part, been pretty great. The turning point for our relationship, I feel, was after he got black out drunk at his friends wedding and spent the entire 1.5 drive home (that I drove him and his friend home from as I was sober) screaming at me and saying nasty things.

Since then things had been pretty good. I have been working on myself, have lost weight, putting more effort into myself and my appearance, and have been making new friends. About 5 months ago he woke up one day and told me he wasn’t happy with his life or me and wanted to leave. He then decided he was wrong and didn’t want to leave.

Not to drag it on to much, but a highlight real of the last 5 months is he has: • Left me 4-5 times and comes back every time saying his sorry. • Been unhappy when I have gone for dinner or to see girl friends. • Got blackout drunk again, and behaved horrendously towards me (I can’t really talk about it on the thread) • The same night as above there was some severe drama with his family. I am also being made to be the villain for telling them this behaviour is disgusting, especially since our 2 children were asleep in bed when everything was happening. • Called me every name under the sun; often in front of our children. • Accused me multiple times of having affairs, with absolutely no suspicions.

I didn’t realise a few of the things can’t be discussed here. 

His excuses are that he doesn’t feel loved enough by me and I’m not affectionate enough. But it’s hard to feel affectionate to someone who is treating you like shit.

I am getting very little family support and being made to feel guilty for breaking our family up if I don’t let him just come back home. But he is never going to change. I guess I’m just looking for some validation and support that I’m making the right decision because I keep being told I’m wrong.

What are my next steps to stay strong in my decision to not take him back, and try and establish a healthy co-parenting relationship for our children?",2740,0.97,2740,0,2827.0,87.0,420,1750813731.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ljsjt7/my_husband_32m_left_me_32f_after_almost_15_years/,False,True
1jqd2vf,relationship_advice,Update: My mum (60f) wants me to donate my egg (30f). How to save our relationship?,"Hi Guys, here is the update to my crazy donor situation.

First of all, thanks a lot for your ideas. One of the commenters suggested that I write it down and I did. That was brilliant: i am really struggling to communicate my thoughts when I am nervous and speaking. I gathered all of your points/suggestions and sent this message:

&gt;""Hi, mom. I talked to my doctor and reviewed/researched the topic of the donation. I will not be doing that (I do not qualify for this anyways). I also find it quite inconsiderate to ask me for that after my experience last year. I as well very disappointed that you did not give a second thought on how it will influence me, my mental health and the dynamic of the relationships in our family.

&gt;Regarding your pregnancy, it is fully your decision but i would like your to consider the following points:

&gt;\-&gt; I am worried how it will affect your health (pregnancy is complicated and dangerous experience given your condition. Even the best doctors wont be able to help in certain situations)

&gt;\-&gt; \[little bro's name\] is still way too young and still needs you a lot. It is irresponsible towards him

&gt;\-&gt; pregnancy in 60s has high chances of abnormality. It is irresponsible towards this hypothetical child

&gt;\-&gt; even if it all works out, I am afraid you wont be able to provide necessary care to this child esp in his teens/young adulthood

&gt;\-&gt; you will have to do childcare alone (we both know your hb won't help) and you just started to do the self-care you needed. Additional stress and work is not what you need at this stage in your life - you should be enjoying your retirement.

&gt;I really hope you will look into this before you decide to proceed.""

I was left on read for some time (tbh I kind of thought it is NC time again).

Then she answered. SHE APOLOGISED (!) and she SAID I WAS RIGHT (!!) and that she didnt want to offend me. The only thing she claimed I am wrong about: she will stay very active in her 80s and that it is more a psychological barrier people have (sure, mum 😒, not physical at all).

I answered ""sure, I hope you stay active until your 100s"". And that was it.

I am still shocked that it went so smoothly. I know it doesn't sound very exciting for you but in my eyes that this is giant: my mum never apologizes. I guess she actually did not want it as well (or maybe stroke after last round of ivf was scary enough? idk).

1jbxq7h,relationship_advice,UPDATE: My (30F) husband (32M) took a trip to his hometown to clear his head. How do I handle this?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/dI3fPUB4AP

Things took a major turn and now I’m considering filing for divorce in a few months. 

When my husband returned from his hometown, we had a big fight. He saw nothing wrong with leaving for a few days to spend time with family and friends. I told him it wasn’t leaving that was the issue, it was the abruptness and manor in which he left! Turns out, his parents are the ones who encouraged him to leave. 

I called his parents to get a better understanding of why they thought that was a good idea especially since I thought we were close. My MIL calls me often but went radio silent while husband was gone. So, when I finally talked to my MIL she says I shouldn’t be so controlling and he is allowed to have his own life. She went on to ask why I didn’t send our 3 month old with him and i scoffed. Why would I send my baby with my angry, irrational husband?? Basically the parents think I’m too controlling and their son needs to still have fun and live his life (I never said he couldn’t!).

After that whole ordeal, I remembered how guarded he suddenly became over his phone a while back, so I checked it. I found text messages between my MIL and husband talking about me like I was nothing. Every little thing I did, he would report back to his mom making me look like a monster. I also found out he’s been recording me! Turning the baby monitor on me to watch me and baby at night, recording arguments and disagreements too. I feel so violated. He’s been sending them to his mother. 

I confronted him about the texts and recordings and it got heated. He ended up pulling out his phone and recording me again in the middle of the argument. I snapped and started wailing and screaming! I’m so embarrassed and scared because I’ve never in my life experienced that type of mental break. The worst part was he recorded ALL of it. I hate him for that. 

I packed up me and baby and left to my family members house . 

TLDR: Husband left to go to his hometown, abruptly after a disagreement regarding responsibilities. Found out in-laws told him to leave me and baby to “clear his head”. Checked his phone and phone recordings of arguments and me taking care of the baby. Confronted husband and he recorded me again in the middle of the argument. I Left to go to family’s house. 

Thank you to everyone for the advice on the original post. I actually listened and will start moving in a different direction. 

UPDATE: Hey everyone! Thank you so much for the encouragement and advice! 

Here’s the update: I met with my attorney and she is not concerned in the least bit about the video of me having a meltdown. I live in a two party state and did not consent to be filmed in my home, so she said the video most likely would not be allowed as an exhibit and even if it was, she will handle it. 

I told her everything from the emotional abuse, lack of help for the baby, him leaving us twice to go out of state and the constant marijuana smoking. Lawyer feels like I have nothing to worry about as far as custody goes but made sure I was informed on his rights as well. Right now I’m getting my financial affairs in order to pay her retainer, so it will take a little time. 

Relationship wise, husband calmed down a bit he was so sweet for a few days then went back to trying to argue. I basically just listen to him and leave the room, I refuse to engage. I’m disappointed that he won’t actually work with me on a solution, instead he wants to just go back to the way things were. Things will never be the same! 

As far as the video footage goes, he allowed me to “delete” everything from his phone and cloud storage. However, days later I discovered he sent the video to his email as evidence. Of course, I wiped everything but there’s no telling if he sent it to friends or family. I asked him if he’s sure the footage has been deleted from EVERYWHERE and he assures me it has been but I know he’s lying. He is also starting to delete text message threads from his mom, so that adds to my distrust. 

To the people that say there are two sides to this story, of course there is! However, you will never hear his side, so what’s the point in even saying that. Just know that I’m holding myself accountable on my actions, I got WAY too emotional and shouldn’t have reacted the way I did when he recorded me. I have zero reason (in my opinion) to come here and lie, I need real help from people who can understand the situation I’m in. I came here for help on my side, so I appreciate the people who offered help and didn’t judge me. I was fearful he would try to take my child but I’m confident that won’t be an issue. 

For now, I’m just keeping the peace until I can get my lawyer money up. I’m still hopeful he will start helping more and stop being so secretive but we’ll see. The truth is we’re having regular postpartum arguments that have been escalated by him going to his mother for council and recording me. I have always tolerated his overbearing mother for the sake of keeping the peace, but when I finally stood up for myself and put boundaries in place, it feels like she went for the jugular during the most vulnerable time in my life, it’s awful! I’ve gone full no contact with her. She’s always able to see her grandbaby but i don’t need to engage with her. My husband shouldn’t have allowed her to be so involved but he did, now things are significantly worse. 

Again, thank you so much to the people who offered hope and kind words! ",2731,0.97,2731,0,2818.0,87.0,322,1742052848.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jbxq7h/update_my_30f_husband_32m_took_a_trip_to_his/,False,True
1n98aur,relationship_advice,My(20f) boyfriend (23m) sided with another girl(23f)over me and made me feel humiliated,"
Last night, I was out to dinner with my boyfriend and a female friend(she’s dating his best friend). While we were eating, she casually told me I should stop eating at night and lose some weight. What hurt more was my boyfriend agreeing with her, saying, “She’s right, it’s for your own good.” I didn’t say anything, but I felt completely humiliated.

Then the topic of doing a mukbang came up. My friend said she talked to my boyfriend earlier and he said no, that I couldn’t do it because I’m getting fat and would end up like a popular overweight streamer. They both laughed. I stayed silent again, I felt embarrassed like he wasn’t taking my stand.

To add to this, earlier that day my boyfriend had used her perfume (a pocket one) after smoking. I casually asked about the scent on his wrist and he denied it at first, then admitted it was hers.

It’s not the first time he’s made comments comparing me to her. He once said I don’t have a “body or height” like hers when I wanted to join them for work at an event.

They refer to each other as ""brother and sister,"" but he listens to her more than me, makes decisions with her, and talks to her in ways he never does with me. When I try to share how I feel, he says I’m overreacting or trying to control him.

1mquaf1,relationship_advice,My (40M) wife (40F) wants to disown her daughter (19F) for dating a women.,"My(40M) wife Laura (40F) have been together for 10 years married for 7. My relationship with Laura has always been great. She had a lot of pain from her ex who emotionally abused her but she was always the kindest person I knew. I fell for her pretty quickly and knew almost right away I wanted to marry her. Laura has a daughter Riley(19F) from her previous relationship, I didn’t meet Riley until a year into our relationship and she did not warm up to me right away, she has a complicated relationship with her dad who has been in and out of her life and resented her mom dating at all. I tried to be understanding, didn’t try to fill a father role in her life and gave her space. Things were especially hard for a few years after they moved in with me about a year into our relationship. Riley acted out a lot, she broke anything I’d give her, was getting in trouble at school a lot, and constantly told us both that she hated us and wanted to live with her dad. Her dad would not take her and barely even paid any child support though, Riley still blamed Laura and I though and this caused some issues between us but I loved Laura a lot though so I put up with Riley’s outbursts for her and we made things work. Eventually when Riley was 14 her dad got remarried and basically cut her off completely which devastated her, Laura and I did our best to support her, we got her into therapy and took a trip to cheer her up and after a while Riley started to improve, her grades went up and she stopped getting in trouble as much at school. I tried to be consistent, I went to her soccer games, helped her with homework, and over time we developed a better relationship. Things have been great since then and the three of us have become a family, I wouldn’t change a thing about our dynamic.

The thing is last week Riley came to us and confessed that she was bi and she wanted us to meet her girlfriend. I have no issue with her being bi, told her that we were proud of her and were sure that we would love her girlfriend, I started making plans to have a dinner with all of us so she could meet the family. My wife though was just quiet the whole time and staring at her daughter. My wife comes from a really religious household so maybe I should have known but she had always seemed fine with LGBTQ+ people, I guess she is one of those people who is fine with gay people existing as long as its not one of her family. She just told Riley to get out. 

The room got quiet, Riley and I looked at each other and I saw Riley was on the verge of tears. Her mom started yelling her, she called her some really awful things and told her that she didn’t want to look at her, she said that unless she went to a religious conversion camp that Riley had to get out of the house and she wasn’t welcome here. At this point I finally jumped in, I told Laura to stop, that we were not going to kick Riley out for being who she is and my wife started going off on me now. She told me that I was betraying her, choosing a sinner (I don’t want to write what she actually said) over her and that unless we got Riley fixed she wasn’t family anymore. I told Riley to go to her room and that Laura and I had to talk. I tried to talk Laura down but she wasn’t hearing it, she is adamant that she wants her daughter out of the house, not only that but she wants to cut Riley off completely, take back the car we gave her, stop paying for her classes and therapy. She actually blames the therapist too, and me for wanting to get her into therapy in the first place. I tried to tell her that would leave her own daughter vulnerable but she doesn’t care. She actually hopes that when Riley hits rock bottom she will come back and then we can pay for her to go to a religious conversion camp. I’m strongly opposed to these kinds of camps, and I told Laura as much. We didn’t get anywhere in our conversation and went to bed without resolving anything. I got some reading material for Laura that I thought could help but she refuses to look at it, she isn’t budging on this and wants to kick out her only daughter. I don’t think I can support this, I’m not even sure if I can look at my wife the same way. She was always so loving, but seeing how hateful she can be to her own daughter disgusts me. How can I help Laura accept her daughter? And failing that, how do I help Riley? I’m worried about her, she has been extremely depressed and crying since last night. 

Edit: thank you all for your comments. They made me realize what matters here. I don’t think I care about the marriage anymore I just want to help my step daughter. Can I legally force my wife to leave the house? It’s a premarital asset in my name. Any suggestions on how to have a talk with Riley and what to say so she knows I will support her no matter what would be great. Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do to cheer her up? Should I be trying to force some kind of reconciliation between her and her mother or would that just cause more damage right now? Literally anything you can think of that would make her feel better would be amazing. Also just any parenting advice for a 19 year old girl, I think I’m about to become a single father unless my wife does a complete 180 but I don’t have a lot of hope there

Quick update: My wife went to go stay with her parents for now, she still isn’t budging and thinks I’m betraying her because I’m siding with Riley. I don’t know if our marriage can ever recover but I made my choice and I don’t regret it.

Had a talk with Riley to let her know that I will support her no matter what and she is always welcome in my home. Like some said she started blaming herself for the marriage issues but I let her know I couldn’t turn a blind eye to my wife’s views on this regardless, and I’d rather know and get divorced than live in ignorance. We are having a movie marathon tonight and ordering some pizza to cheer her up, her girlfriend is coming over dinner Sunday and I’m looking forward to meeting her. Riley is having a rough time, there’s been a lot of tears but she let me know how much it means to her that I’ve always been there for her. I don’t think she will want to see her mother for a while if ever which surprised me.",2725,0.97,2725,0,2812.0,87.0,642,1755254999.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mquaf1/my_40m_wife_40f_wants_to_disown_her_daughter_19f/,False,True
1i1aj8a,relationship_advice,"I, 45F have recently discovered my husband 40M may potentially be cheating on me. I need help deciphering the evidence I have discovered.","I have been married to my husband for over 15 years and just recently, I have uncovered some potential evidence suggesting that he may be involved with infidelity.

On a date night, my husband decided to take me to a restaurant that he usually visits, however, it is the first time he's taken me. After the dinner, I decide to make small talk with the waitress. She ends up mistaking me as a friend of my husband's. I correct her and say that I am his wife. She looks startled and glances at my husband questioning him, saying 'your wife doesn't usually look like this.' I am beyond shocked because it could only mean one thing - that she's seen him bring another woman into the restaurant, and that they've been intimate enough to suggest that they are in a relationship.

I get angry at him on the way home and he keeps insisting: 'If I was cheating on you I would never bring you to the same restaurant that I've brought my mistresses to.' I needed reassurance and instead, he gets frustrated at me when he should be helping me with this misunderstanding (hopefully it is one).

Am I being delusional about this situation?

Some background information: my husband and I have not had sex for over a year, which I find unusual. I have never turned him down, therefore I suspect he must be receiving sexual pleasure elsewhere.

I never thought my husband was the kind of man to partake in infidelity. He has always been kind and honest to me, however, I am finding more and more evidence to suggest that he may be cheating on me and I'm wondering if I'm being delusional here.

1jzexs6,relationship_advice,I 33M feel like i’m losing my mind from the things my wife F33 does and thinks nothing of,"today i took our daughter F6 to the park down the street, she plays often with two young boys whose parents we are fimiliar with, today i sat and had a conversation with the boys mother as they played which i have done in the past. 

my daughter then got on the circular swing with the one boy and asked me to come push them, before i could get my dog to come with me my daughter yelled “ stop talking to your girlfriend and come push me” i told her “ that’s (boys names) mother don’t be weird” 

we come home and my wife gets home from work, i tell her what our daughter did and how awkward it was. she starts taking shots immediately “ oh you have a girlfriend around the corner “ “ maybe that’s why you go to the park”. due to past similar events this already angers me greatly.

 i go to shower, my daughter tells my wife that i was sitting there holding hands with the mother and looked like we were in love. totally untrue but she’s 6 years old.

 I get out of the shower to her on the bed waiting to question me. She says “ can i ask you a question “ i say yes. she asks if i was holding the mothers hand i say no that is ridiculous how can you think that’s even a possibility. we just talked for all of 5 minutes. 

she doesn’t back down, she carry’s on with more and says she believes my daughter. i told her to go to the mothers house and talk to her then. like wtf 

i hate this, it feels like such an insult and just shows me our whole marriage is bullshit and she thinks nothing of me. she’s so insecure and always accusing me of things and i just feel like i am going to explode and i can’t take it anymore.

can anyone relate or offer advice on this ?  

UPDATE: 

okay so a lot of feedback here, i’ll try to touch on some of the points for clarity. 

- initially i did tell my wife that nothing happened it was the continuation that angered me 

-my wife has what i would call aggressive insecurity, we have been together 13 yrs and she has been like this the whole time. I HAVE NOT CHEATED. I have 0 relationships with females in my life. I am in construction and told my wife about a situation at work involving one of the site
superintendents who happens to be a woman and she questioned me immediately asking if i like her and is she pretty etc. that’s an example of her typical behaviour. i have been dealing with this for years and i have no mental bandwidth, patience or empathy left to offer her for this behaviour.

- my daughter has never said something like this before, and i refuse to blame her. was it wrong yes and i talked to her about it. Many people are aggressively saying “ of course she believes your daughter “ which is okay, but to continue to believe her after i tell her it’s entirely untrue is not okay. 

- i have not seen the mother of the boys in at least a month, i had not been to the park in a few weeks. this is not a common occurrence, and i have never planned a park visit to be social with anyone i go there so my daughter can play and be outside. Sometimes the boys father is there instead who i also have a friendly relationship consisting of small talk every once in a while.   

- Am i wrong to feel like this constant doubt of my character and essentially accusations of stupidity are something i shouldn’t have to deal with? Like if i was a cheater why would i do it 100’ from my house and in front of my child",2713,0.95,2713,0,2864.0,151.0,275,1744678144.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jzexs6/i_33m_feel_like_im_losing_my_mind_from_the_things/,False,True
1kwetwp,relationship_advice,"My [27f] boyfriend [31m] is now sleeping outside in a tent, what other options can we explore?","I moved in with my bf about 7 months ago. We slept together 3-4 nights a week prior to that. No issues. The past two months he says I keep him up with the sound of my breathing and the very rare snoring when I’m sick and congested. Sometimes I take a shower go to the bathroom or plug in my phone too late and it wakes him. We have slept apart for the past month or so. I hate it but respect his need for better rest. I sleep in the bedroom and he was sleeping on the floor of the living room on a twin mattress. I feel horrible about this and offer for me to sleep in the living room or at the very least for us to trade on and off but he says he prefers it in there. 

Today he went to buy a tent for the backyard because it’s “too loud” inside even in separate rooms. I feel like this is an extreme reaction. He’s never wanted to establish a common bedtime even though I’ve asked many times. He won’t try white noise or earplugs or melatonin for his sleeplessness. We have a second bedroom but the bathroom connects them so setting up a bed in there doesn’t really address bathroom noise problem. 

His parents gifted him the house and neither of us pay rent. He isn’t asking me to leave and is “happy” sleeping in the tent but I feel so guilty like I’ve pushed him out of his home even though I never wanted him to go outside. I don’t feel morally right staying here with that arrangement plus is kinda creepy in here alone. It’s an old house and the two back doors don’t lock and there are no blinds as he’s not a fan of them. There was someone walking around in the back on the deck where the bedroom is looking in one night when he was away and I feel safer with him inside. But more than that I feel bad knowing I’m in a bed and he’s in a tent. 

I’ve tried to think of alternative solutions but he doesn’t like any that I’ve posed. I ask to compromise and find something we can both agree on but he says he needs the tent. Honestly I can’t stay living here if that’s the new normal. It just feels wrong. He says that’s fine we don’t have to live and be together then. 

Does anyone have ideas or can make any sense of this? I love him and want to find a solution but this can’t be the only option. 

For reference he has been hospitalized 10x times for cannabis induced schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and is easily irritated by snoring as he had psych ward roomies who snored a lot. He’s off cannabis now and mostly stable but still sensitive and probably traumatized by the hospitalizations.


TLDR: boyfriend I moved in with is sensitive to noise when sleeping and resorted to sleeping in a tent outside without considering other options first. He won’t budge on the tent and I feel weird staying in his house with him outside.  

Thanks 💔

EDIT: thank you everyone for your thoughtful replies! I didn’t not expect this overwhelming response. I am reading every reply, there is just a lot so sorry if I can’t respond right away. 

For ref I don’t snore every night. He has told me this and I shared a bed with my best friend for three nights recently and she said I never snored. Same with my sister who I have done the same. I don’t snore if I change positions which I was doing when he and I slept together. Thanks for the thoughts on sleep apnea but pretty sure I don’t have it. I just snore if my nose is stuffed in the winter when sick. Very infrequent. It’s more of my breathing that bothers him. 

Probably wasn’t the best mention the mental health at the end. I understand that makes it seem like an afterthought. I’m totally not ignoring it but yes maybe didn’t consider it to be the central issue since he’s doing pretty well these days. For context he is not in meds, refuses to take them so his family and doctors stopped pushing the issue. They see him being off cannabis as the main solution and he got to sobriety before me moving in. If I were ever to bring it up meds he gets furious. He feels the meds they gave him in the hospital have had very bad long term effects on him, which I understand. From what he tells me Invega can be rough and as he is a classical musician, it dulls his playing ability. He had weekly therapy for most of the time since the last hospitalization but she paused him because she “went on a retreat” which was apparently a month long but it been two plus months and he hasn’t returned and when I ask about it he gets irate. My mom supposed the therapist quit on him but he said she didn’t and she’s just out of town but also he “doesn’t need therapy anyway”. Obviously I think there is something fishy there. 

His indifference to breaking it off definitely speaks volumes about his wanting to be in the relationship and as much as I love him, I agree with you all, it is not sustainable. I’m now looking for a place in the city I moved from, it just takes time as there is a lot of competition for rentals. That being said, if you have personal experience, advice or wisdom that may be relevant in my leaving and passing the baton back to him parents, let me know. He definitely needs help but refuses it and it seems like I’m no longer helping by being here (that’s the reason I originally moved here, to support him in coming out of the hospital). 

Much love and many thanks to you all. Sometimes it’s hard to see things clearly when you’re close to them. I appreciate everyone who has responded.

1hx5h7m,relationship_advice,My (29M) boyfriend wants me (28F) to do house wife duties when we both work full time. How do I explain why this isn’t fair?,"We are not engaged yet and no kids, he makes triple what I make in income so he decided he would pay the total rent and I would cover utilities/groceries. We both work full time, he sometimes works some overtime but I still work 40 hours a week. 

He thinks because he pays all of rent that I have to do all the cleaning in the house including picking up his messes because “it’s your job as a woman to be proud of a clean house”. 

So when I get home from work or have a day off he expects me to do all the cleaning where when he comes home he can sit and watch tv. I can’t afford to go 50/50 on rent with my current income and he doesn’t want to do income based bills. 

But I really don’t think it’s fair even if he pays the rent because I feel we both deserve rest time and free time and I’m not a maid. But when I try to bring it up he says “then we can just go 50/50”. I’d have to find a second job to afford that.

So she opened more cards that haven’t hit her report and maxed them to the total tune of $60k. When she first told me she lied and originally claimed 30k and later came clean it was actually 60k.

She told me she can “feel the resentment” and can’t take it.  So she has packed some things and moved in with her grandma. I never yelled at her, but I did tell her I was disgusted and disappointed and that I can’t believe she did this to her two dogs and soon to be born son.

1lc1sr6,relationship_advice,UPDATE: How can I (F24) deal with the fact my boyfriend (M26) dreads getting married to me?,"Hey, I made a post about a week or so ago explaining that my boyfriend was suddenly acting really weird and angry about the idea of a wedding. It took a bit of time for him to think about it but he sat me down the same night that I made the initial post and read me a letter he had been working on for about a week. He explained it was the second draft and not super polished but when he started reading it, I felt the blood drain from my face. It was over 2,000 words about how I’m depressed and here’s all of the ways it affected him. 

He acknowledged it was the worst depressive episode he’s ever seen me in and instead of trying to get me help, he compared my negativity to his ex girlfriend. He said so many hurtful things and later admitted that he never considered how the letter would affect me. 

I asked for a copy of the letter to go over in my own time and as I read it on my own I realized that there was no saving the relationship. I will never stay with someone that would spend a significant amount of time writing something so hurtful and then saying it to my face. The idea of having children with someone who doesn’t understand how damaging and hurtful their words are is a dealbreaker. 

The crazy thing is, this man also has depression and I’ve helped him through numerous depressive episodes without raising an eyebrow. I’ve been there when he couldn’t get out of bed for days, I was there when he couldn’t feed himself, and I supported him the best I could and in return I get a shitty ass letter telling me how I’m not good enough because my depression makes him feel yucky. 

We’ve been living together for years and signed a year long lease about 2 months ago. The only way to break said lease is to pay 50% of the remaining 10 months. I’m not rolling in money so that’s not an option. They also don’t allow for lease takeovers and subletting is only allowed with special permission but they are taking their sweet time getting back to us. 

Our current plan is for him to move in with his parents and pay rent so that we don’t have to be around each other constantly. It’s not a messy breakup but things are still raw and it’s hard not to slip back into the routine. It’s hard going through a breakup when you still sleep right next to them every night.

1ksetks,relationship_advice,I (29F) can't get over the fact that my boyfriend (31M) comforted his ex-wife (28F) while I was going through the aftermath of an abortion,"A while ago, I had an abortion. It was physically and emotionally draining, and I really needed support — especially from my boyfriend.

At the same time, his ex-wife (yes, ex-wife) was threatening to take her own life, and he ended up putting all his focus on her. He was constantly on the phone with her, checking in, reassuring her. I understand that a suicide threat is serious and I don’t want to sound cold — I genuinely get that it was a tough situation.

But I felt completely abandoned. I was going through one of the most difficult things I’ve ever experienced, and he wasn’t there for me emotionally. I felt invisible. He seemed to forget I was grieving too — and instead, he gave all his emotional bandwidth to someone from his past.

I’ve tried to bring it up with him since, but I can’t shake the feeling that I was put second in a moment when I needed to be first.

I don’t know how to move forward. Part of me wants to forgive him, but another part of me is still deeply hurt and resentful. Has anyone been through something similar? How did you deal with it?

CLARIFICATION/UPDATE: He doesn’t have any kids. Yes, it was our baby, and we both made the decision to go through with the abortion for personal reasons (which I won’t get into here). I don’t think he told his ex directly, but he did tell his friend —who, to be honest, isn’t exactly my biggest fan. She’s actually told him she does not like me, so it’s possible she’s the one who said something. (That’s a whole other story.)

UPDATE:
I just want to thank everyone here for giving me a third person pov into the situation and I appreciate all the responses! They were incredibly helpful. 
After giving it some thought, I decided to reach out to him about the issue. We talked about it and he acknowledged how much he hurt me and genuinely apologised, saying he understands where I'm coming from and assured me that he's completely cut her out of his life. He hopes we can move forward from this. I’m willing to try, especially since I can see his sincerity.

1ih4h53,relationship_advice,My (30M) wife (32F) tested positive for Chlamydia,"We've been married for roughly 10 years at this point. Things haven't been great the past few years but we are both actively working on making our relationship better. She springs on me today that she just got word from her Dr that she tested positive for BV and, more significantly to me, Chlamydia. Cue the ""do you have anything you need to tell me?"". I, genuinely, have never touched another person during our relationship. She says the only two ways she would've gotten it is if I was unfaithful (no), or that she borrowed her friends sex toy back in December.

I have not been tested yet, however after searching online I do have symptoms in-line with Chlamydia. I've been sick lately so I was just chalking it up to that, but I guess not. She said the Dr said a BV swab can show a false positive for Chlamydia so she is getting retested in a few days, but after connecting the dots I would be very surprised if it was a false positive.

I desperately want to believe that this is a mistake or because of the sharing of sex toys (very strange to me, but I'm not female so idk). I wish I was more confident, but things have been hit or miss for the past few years as we are working out issues. She has, in the past few months, become increasingly attached to her phone. Posting numerous stories on snapchat per day, messaging people on snapchat, etc. At this point I fear I'm just over analyzing, but I'm not sure where to go/what to do from here. Obviously I'm hoping for a false positive, but given my symptoms I don't have much hope there. Is it possible to get it from sharing sex toys? Is that a thing people do?

UPDATE:  
Sorry for not updating or responding, this is a throwaway account obvs and its a bit of a pain for me to go back and forth.

To answer some questions:

\-This isn't AI (wtf?)

\-She accused me, asking if I had anything to tell her. She seemed very angry, then suddenly switched to very sorry, then slightly annoyed-ish and has remained that way so far. I have not made any accusations or reciprocated the question.

\-Yes, I have an appointment to get myself tested tomorrow, so we will see how that goes.

\-No, we have not been in contact with any koalas

\-Her friend is a female. She at first said ""It was either you or (female friend)"". I was unhappy with that, as she's joked about girl/girl before and I did tell her I considered that cheating. She shortly afterwards clarified that she had ""been drinking and borrowed one of her sex toys."" I haven't asked for further details yet.

\-We have always had a great sex life, we have children/cars/house/etc together. It would be extremely difficult to untangle our lives, not to mention very financially impactful. I guess I was/am clinging onto the hope that this is somehow not what it very obviously seems to be.

\-It has been years since I've been tested, never felt the need to as I'd never been unfaithful, nor had I had any glaringly obvious symptoms.

UPDATE 1.5-ish:

Not sure how many times I can update a single post within the rules but I'll keep going until I get stopped or have something significant enough for another post.  
First off, I got tested first thing this morning. According to the lab, it will take 2-3 days to get the results back. Second, another big red flag to me in afterthought, is why, assuming the false positive was a possibility, would she not immediately schedule a retest instead of waiting days for her next appointment. Third, I've seen some comments about dormancy. We've been together for 10 years, that seems like an exceptionally long time for BOTH of us to be asymptomatic. Additionally, we have children together. To my understanding, she would've been tested during each pregnancy. It was never mentioned or brought up and I was at 99% of the appointments. This leads me to the conclusion that she contracted it sometime after she had our last child. The two scenarios left are that she cheated with another man, and wholly lied about the sex toy incident, OR there is more to the sex toy incident than what is being told. I am refraining from any questioning or accusations until my test results come back. It will be easy enough to verify if her friend gave it to her, as there's a relationship on that end that would be ruined if that were the case.

I appreciate all the comments, some helpful some not, but all have made me think very critically about this situation and what the true ramifications are.",2671,0.96,2671,0,2787.0,116.0,1419,1738628128.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ih4h53/my_30m_wife_32f_tested_positive_for_chlamydia/,False,True
1obxtax,relationship_advice,I (27M) am probably going to die soon. I don't know how to tell my wife (28F) of 7 years that I don't want treatment.,"I don't use reddit like at all so forgive me if I don't have all the mannerisms down.
I (27M) went to the doctor for leg pain. I thought it was just a knee or hip problem. Got told I got bone cancer and would be dead in 3-6 months without treatment. They said with chemo I might be able to last another year, but odds were slim. Another option was surgery, which could add five years, but they'd be taking a huge chunk of my hip bone and it would severely hamper my mobility. It's more common in younger folkss but apparently I'm just lucky. Yay for me. Don't quote me on this I'm just a dude who half listened to his doctor summarize this all.
Look. The truth is I'm not terribly upset. Maybe it just hasn't set in yet idk. Iv been sitting on this for about 2 weeks and keeping it to myself. Iv never really enjoyed...life. which sounds terrible I know. Im not suicidal, but if I were in a plane crash iv always felt like my first thought would be ""finally it's over!"" Let's be honest, living is hard, and it kinda sucks. Im not suicidal or nothing, but Iv never wanted to live forever.
That said, my wife (28F) has a plethora of mental health issues. I love her more than anything in the world. I would die for her in an instant, more importantly iv been willing to live for her. She's struggled with suicidal thoughts with depression and anxiety. She's one of the strongest people I know but has to deal with some of the worst demons I've ever seen. Iv tried my best to help her, and we've made it work for 7 years. 7 years where she has been the highlight of my existence, and I like to think she thinks the same of me.
When I got this news, the first feeling I had (after the numbness had faded) was relief. Obviously there's some fear of the unknown, but mostly relief. But I don't know how to tell my wife. She only just got out of a major depressive rut, and I'm afraid this could tip her back into that rut. On top of that, she would probably tell me to pursue treatment. To fight till the end. I love her, but I honestly don't think that would do anything.
If I go through surgery, I last 5 years maybe. 5 years where my mobility will be extremely limited. Im almost certainly going to lose my job from it (physical labor) and with it my health insurance. I'm sure there are legal protections but how far would those extend? I literally wouldn't be able to return to work ever, best case. If I lose my jobs health insurance, my wife doesn't get her meds and we go back to the depressive spiralling. On top of all that, I'm not sure I could stand to be that large of a burden on my wife. She has plenty of problems, but if I became a cripple she would have to not only care for herself (which she already has problems doing) but care for me. All while there's a ticking clock over our heads. Im sure if I asked her, she'd say ""of course I'd care for you! I love you!"" But that's easy to say. I. Reality, bitterness and resentment would build up. I couldn't support her the way she'd need, I couldn't contribute. I don't think I could bare to watch my wife slowly begin to resent my existence. That scares me far more than dieing.
Chemo I last maybe another miserable year of slowly withering away. Not very ideal, and with all the same problems
So, my question is, how do I tell her? I understand I'm being selfish for wanting to just...leave, but her receiving my life insurance without mountains of medical debt is by far the most appealing option here. I don't want to  hurt her, and I can't bare to be a burden. So how do I express my reasons in a way that makes...sense? Idk. This is probably a mistake going to reddit but eh, nothing to lose.

TLDR: I got cancer, I'm dieing. With treatment, I last 5 years of serverely limited mobility and my wife will have to care for me. My wife already suffers enough and I don't want to see her begin to resent me. I'd honestly rather just die, get it over with. How do I tell her?

Edit: to be clear y'all im going to tell her. It would be far worse if I just dropped dead and it's a shock. I just don't know how to tell her

Its been a wild few days, but I for one hate an unsatisfying ending to any piece of hot gos i come across, so i figure the least I could do was give an update on whats happening, where im standing, and clarify any points of confusion that Im seeing.

To clarify, the plan was always to tell her. I only wanted to find the best way to inform my wife of my decision in a way that a) made it clear she wasnt to blame, and that this was my choice b) gave her enough room to state her opinion on the matter, and to have her felt heard. and c) to try and prevent a complete mental collaspe in these last few months.

another point of clarification is regarding my health. I'll try to clear that up here. I have malignant osteosarcoma, high grade stage locally advanced. It began in the right side of my pelvis and has crossed the midline into the left side. It has invaded both sides of the sacrum, but has not reached any major blood vessels or organs. the sacrum, as i understand it, is the flat, triangular bone that connects the spine to both sides of the pelvis. The tumor being malignant means that it is expanding, and is eating into the foundation that lets me stand and sit upright. This has resulted in pain in my upper right leg. This is happening because the tumor is pressing on nerves that run from my spine through my pelvis and into my leg. This has resulted in a burning, throbbing feeling.

Iv seen alot of confusion on why I dont pursue the surgery. The way its been explained to me is that surgery cannot remove the cancer completely, as it is on both sides of sacrum. its simply to late for that. The operation would mean removing most of the pelvic bone, including the areas that connect my spine to my legs. This would result in me not being able to walk, as the thing proping my spine up on my waist is gone.  I wouldnt be able to sit up straight without support. the pelvis is what gives you balance and structure in your sitting position, and (again) its gone. What would happen is i would up tilting and falling onto one side if I attempted to sit. I would need a specialized wheelchair designed for spinal and pelvic support to remain upright and transfer safely. I would need assistance laying in bed properly, going to the bathroom, and dressing. this would be my reality for at most 5 years.

the other thing to bare in mind about the surgery is that it is not a curative measure. it would be a life prolonging type deal, meant to remove the bulk of the tumor to slow the spread, relieve pain on the nerves, and avoid complications like fractures, infections etc.

Another point some have made it about prothesis, hip replacments, and prothetics. Iv asked my doctor about this, and theyve told me there simply wouldnt be enough left of my pelvis to do this. A hip replacment relys on anchoring itself into a healthy bone, there just isnt enough left to do this.
currently, I am pursueing options to reduce the pain, and try to make the next few months livable. doctors have perscribed for the worst of it, and we are investigating something called pallative radiation therapy, which i think is a kinda mini chemo, meant to shrink the tumor for some relief. we're also considering nerve blocking agents, where they deaden the nerves and numb the pain. The doctors have recommended I use a cane for now, to keep pressure off my right side.

Alright. the big update. My wife. The day after my post, I spoke to her that morning after I had made us a big breakfast of her favorite things. her knowing me, she refused to eat anything until i explained why. We had a long conversation, and we both called in for work. she was understandably upset, angry, hurt, sad, grief stricken, bereft, mopey, and all the other synonyms you can put on here. At one point she had become nauseous and we played the ""hold my hair out of my face"" game over the toilet. As i explained my reasoning, and how i wanted to proceed, she was understandably angry. She said almost everything I thought she would, that she was willing to take care of me, that i shouldnt leave her alone, that we would find new ways of living. I ended up giving her my paperwork and we went over it in more detail than I had previously read. Tbh I was kinda avoiding it, I knew the basics of what was in there, but it was suprisingly difficult to go over it in detail. I had written down many of the suggestions on what kind of solutions there were for living from this reddit page, but one by one they looked more and more dire. We had a couples counseling session that afternoon (part of the reason I had told her then) and we had sent word a few hours ahead of what was going on. our therapist helped me and my wife state our mind sets more clearly, and we were able to make some good progress in the meantime. Our therapist gave us the number for a grief specialist for us to get in contact with before we left.

One thing that was VERY suprising for me was that night, my wife told me she wanted me to get her pregnant. I objected bc wtf. but when pretty girl takes her clothes off your brain kinda just goes ""awooga"".

I had an Oncologist appointment this morning (i had this timed out yall). I brought my wife with me, and she ended up taking the lead in that particular arena. She had done some research on possible treatments (some of which yall suggested) and had a shit ton of questions for the doctor. we spent maybe a good hour there as we went through all the options, and she explained what was happening to my hip. The doctor was very knowledgable and patient with us. My wife ended up getting angry a bit, but the doctor was polite and understanding. We ended up spending another half hour in the parking lot of the hospital as she had a full meltdown while heading out to the car. That...was difficult to be a part of.

Our plan for today is that shes going to lay down for a bit, gather herself for awhile and then we're going to tell our parents. Shes close to both of her parents and I am...less so. Im closer to my siblings (I'm the oldest of 6). We're going to tell her parents first, which will let them be able to watch my wife for awhile before I go and break the news to my own family on my own.
thanks again for all the good wishes and I hope this can help clear up some of the confususion.

TLDR medical clarifications. Told my wife and she is understanably upset. went to our therapist who helped us see each others POV. we also saw an oncologist and my wife got the opportunity to drill the doctor for details. my wife is still looking for a solution that doesnt sacrifice quality of life, but shes hitting a wall. next step is to break it to our respective families. She has already gotten 2 major breakdowns, which is about what was expected.

1l0vqie,relationship_advice,I (28F) freaked out about my bf’s (30m) fetish/request and broke up with him. He wants to explain even if we don’t get back together. Is there any good explanations for what he wanted?,"I thought we were doing really well. We hadn’t hit any huge milestones but we were staying at each other’s places a lot with lots of good sex and we were talking about getting a place together. We also mixed well with each other’s friends and had similar interests and life goals. 

I felt relaxed in his presence which is not something that comes easy for me, and while laying in bed he  did the face he does when he wants to try something new or do something that is is for his pleasure more than mine, basically the face that says “I feel guilty for even thinking this so I want you to ask me what I’m thinking so it’s like you brought it up.” Nothing too extreme had ever came up before and I always thought the whole act was kinda cute, it reminded me of the youthful nerves of my first sexual relationship. So I asked what was on his mind.

After the usual “no pressure” and “I’m just wondering what you think” and all that we got to the actual idea: He wanted me to have sex with his friend while he watched. 

I freaked out and I don’t usually do that, I’m able to have calm conversations with tense topics but this felt very different. It was like a visceral reaction that I could barely even control, feelings and words became so blended that I’m not sure where my thoughts ended and what I actually said out loud. I do know how it made me feel: like everything I thought we had was a lie and that he thought I was his whore and that his relationship with his friends was so much important than our relationship or my dignity that he could just toss me to them like it was nothing and worse he could get off on watching that. 

There was also all the other stuff that would come with it: did he already discuss this with them? Had he done this before to other girls? Was I hanging out with these boys while they were thinking they were gonna fuck me? Also what about after, like we hang out with these people, and I was just supposed to treat them like just my boyfriend’s friends after letting them see me naked and having sex with them? 

I’m not a prude or religious or whatever but I am not the kind of person that can do that and I would feel so uncomfortable and degraded having a causal friendship with someone who I did that with knowing they had seen all of me and even done stuff with me. Seeing me naked is a big deal to me, having sex is a big deal to me. That trust has to be earned and now I not only felt like he wanted me to ignore my own boundaries but that I hadn’t really known the real him when the him that I knew made me feel loved and safe. 

Like if he had said a stranger and this was some sort of cucking thing and I’d never have to see them again, I would have still said no but I wouldn’t have reacted like this. If he had said another boy or girl in bed with us that was a stranger we’d never have to see again, I still would’ve said no, but I wouldn’t have reacted like this. It’s the friends part that makes me feel so gross and objectified, and makes me question everything.

Anyway at some point in my stream of consciousness attack I told him we were done and left his place not even grabbing my stuff.

He’s been texting me trying to get the chance to explain and saying that even if we don’t get back together he wants me to understand what he was “actually asking” and what his feelings for me are/were. 

I basically feel like I know everything I need to, but it was a LTR that I was invested in, and if he had fucked up in another way, even cheated or stole from me I’d at least let him explain himself while still breaking up with him.

Is there anything that can make this not as bad as it sounded?

1levqsg,relationship_advice,I (44F) became disabled 3.5 years ago and my husband (45M) sighs when I ask for help with basic tasks.,"My husband and I have been together for 20 years, married 10. 

I became disabled about 3.5 years and despite losing most mobility in my legs, coupled with some significant pain flares, where it’s hard to move, I still keep up with a lot of tasks. I also am the primary caretaker for my daughter. I dress her, bathe her, feed her, take her to and from school, do homework, etc. I do the shopping, organize family events, do our finances, schedule doc appointments, etc. As far as housework, I still do majority laundry, dishes, meal for hubby, my daughter and myself. I still keep everything tidy and neat in all rooms, I clean the kitchen, windows, clean the bathrooms (even if it’s on my hands and knees) but I just can’t vacuum any longer. Now, my husband has always cut the grass, does the pool, hot tub, garbage etc and works a full time job so i understand he’s busy too. 

I am a type A and prior to becoming disabled, I did everything and never had to ask for help from anyone, I just did it all. I never asked my husband to vacuum or help with laundry and simple task like when he’s home from work, like if he could retrieve a few things for me so I can save some physical steps. For example, I ask, “can you get our daughter a snack”, “can you throw the laundry in the dryer”( it’s hard for me to bend some days) or “can you fill my water or get my pills”, etc. Mind you, 80% of days he comes home to a meal waiting for him and we don’t bother him until he’s showered and finished with his dinner or he’s even more grumpy. When I ask him these ‘favors’, I am a lot of times met with eye rolls, heavy sighs or sarcastic remarks like ‘great’ or ‘I am so happy to do that for you’. I talked to him over and over to nauseam how this hurts my heart very much. It’s already hard enough that I have the drive but not the physical stamina to accomplish the millions of tasks set forth. He said at least 2 dozen times that he’ll do better but it’s 3.5 years. It makes me so distant from him. I also lost so much respect for him that it’s hard for me to see him as a parter. I know he works hard and has stressors but I wanted a teammate. I feel cheated. He says who cares what his response  is just as long as he does what I ask.
What are your thoughts on this? I’m lost on what to do next… TIA for the read! ",2636,0.97,2636,0,2720.0,84.0,279,1750288831.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1levqsg/i_44f_became_disabled_35_years_ago_and_my_husband/,False,True
1mv6jce,relationship_advice,I M23 told my wife F29 that her childhood friend tried to have sex with me while she was drunk. I got kicked out and now her friend is asking me to go see her???,"Yes I ended up telling my wife what happened and I listened to you guys and woke her up to tell her. I told her every single detail and she sort of doubted that nothing happened between us so in her mind she thinks I fucked her friend, but I didn’t.

My wife has full access to my phone and my location 24/7 and we have the cloud family setup so I have nothing to hide. Ya’ll were right. She said I should have told her when it happened and I reassured her a dozen times nothing happened, but she said she needed time on her own and she called up her friend and gave her hell too. She asked me to leave the house for a couple days and last night I slept in the car hoping she would tell me to come back.

Nope. Her friend texted me and asked to talk so she called me on the phone. I argued with her about why she would do something like that. She apologized and she told me she just kind of caught feelings fir me because she saw how well I treat my wife and she wants what I have with my wife . She knows I got kicked out and she keeps calling me and telling me I could stay at her place while my wife cools down

I’m not so sure on her intentions though. What can I do moving forward now that I am sleeping in the csr and my eife is doubting me??


Edit: my marriage is pretty much over.. my wife is going to divorce me. I did go an talk to her friend and she told me the truth and it hurt me deep down in my soul. My wife is in love with another man who is more established and is older and makes a lot more money than anyone in my age bracket.

Her friend first told me that my wife was basically emotionally cheating snd I didn’t believe her until she showed me some semi old texts between her and my wife. She mentioned her being satisfied with me as a provider, but I wasn’t enough for her and I was too immature. I confronted my wife and she broke it to me that she is going to let things go with way me.

Her friend offered me to stay at her place in the spare room while we sort things out with our lawyer and the custody of our baby. You guys can bash me all you want over me staying here for now, but I am honestly done and lost what I cared about most.

1klc213,relationship_advice,"My husband (m40) dropped a bombshell on me (f39) this morning, how do I process this?","We have been married for 15 years, together for 19. My husband is and always has been very introverted, not the easiest friend maker, the few he has are lifers (people he's known for longer than we've been together). 

I am his second serious partner in his whole life (apologies, some back story is a bit necessary), and our esrly relationship was a very slow and steady time of learning each other before taking big steps (first kiss was months after dating began, sex was months after that, moving in was years, marriage was more years). No complaints on the slow build, it was a wonderful time getting to know him significantly deeper than just the physical (and no he wasn't seeing anyone else or anything like that, it's not his lifestyle). We are nearly 2 decades later, and I have seen him go from a nearly 10 year long career due to managerial differences (covid related issues with in the workplace, this was a place he saw him self retiring from) to two different jobs in less than 3 years and still not seeming happy. I feel like home life is tiresome for him, a lot of the ""how was your day"" conversations are bland, and end with ""I'm just not feeling it"" or something close to exasperation from the conversation. It's becoming very obvious he's not happy. 

This morning he dropped his bombshell in me of ""weird though I had yesterday. You know how we drove by *insert name of well know strip joint* on the way to you mothers day time. I thought to my self, I think I'd like to go there, you know."" 

The reason this is more monumental for him is: no, he has never been, never had an inclination to go, no desire, no want. He truly has not shown interest in this, ever. None of his friends are into it, none of his coworkers. He really hates being a focus of attention in any capacity, he really doesnt like being touched by most people.

I feel like little by little he is starting a weird mid life crisis, not happy with job, he's on his phone almost constantly from the time he gets home to just before bed. New car. Motorcycle. He showed me a music video to a new band the other day and the woman in it was a well know alt porn star he immediately recognized, that was fun to hear. Porn seems to be nightly for him as well. Our sex like has diminished to weekend quickies mostly (not gonna lie feels like he faking it a lot, just to get it over with).

I know marriages hit a wall of boredom occasionally...I really don't know how to process this. It feels worse when I feel like my very presence seems to annoy him. I would say he puts on a happy face, but somewhere in there he's trying to figure out how to move on, but also is, I don't know, scared? If he goes and that choice doesn't work, will this still be waiting for him? If he goes, all the time spent  holding this life is wasted, and how does he compensate for that? Can he start something and hide it and hope he can double life it? 

This strip joint thing has me over thinking...but I know him well enough that he might find something he likes and try it out, slowly over time, and then he's left: my absolute worst nightmare.

Ok guys,

So I've been married for 5 years now,

Everything has been pretty good considering

, my wife is beautiful, funny and awesome

I'm a fully qualified plumber, earn pretty good money, and save kinda well.

My wife works a retail job.

My job was never an issue and never mentioned negatively, until very recently when she met up with her old best friend from highschool and uni somewhat recently.

For context, my wife is (and she will back this up haha) VERY attractive, and I'm kinda ""punching""

A already knew Her and her friend were very popular when they were younger, always been a joke she wouldn't have talked to me when we were at school if we had met because I was more of a regular guy I guess. (These things are relevant)

Her friend married a guy who now owns some engineering firm/business, and is obviously very well off (similar age to me)

The friend, doesn't work, stays home, goes to the beach ect during the day, and her husband has a nice car, a wakeboarding boat, a investment property and other luxuries


My wife met with her friend about 3-4 weeks ago for the first time in a couple years  and the second my wife came back, she kept saying how her friend was doing so well, how lucky she is to not have to work ect.

This was the end of it, until about a week after, when they caught up for drinks this time, and I picked my wife up and she was a bit drunk.

In the car she asked ""did you study at school""

""How come you never started a business""


And just a couple insulting questions I felt kinda bad about, I ignored them, but during the drive, She continued to mention how her friend doesn't have to work, and how her friend was going on about how she didn't ever expect my girlfriend to have to work a normal job ect.


Well, this past week, my wife has continued to prod and ask questions about why I'm not higher up at my job, if I don't try at work,, if I'm settling career wise ect.

She admitted to me she wishes she didn't have to work and it's ""not her dream"" to be working a job every day.

I feel really shit about myself, and have been looking online for jobs that pay higher our of curiosity, (not much does that I could even remotely qualify for)


I told her I'm sorry, and that I'm trying my best, and she has been a bit dismissive of it

Where do I go from here? How do I tell my wife it's not possible for her to be a stay at home wife?

1nvhj8k,relationship_advice,"My dad 50M didn’t come to see me 22F when I was dying, how can I forgive him?","I 22F was hospitalized on Saturday due to an infection that went ignored by doctors. I didn’t realize how sick I was until my mom 50F, who I was supposed to have been seeing for lunch on Saturday, insisted that I needed to see a doctor and took me to the ER where it turned out that I was septic. If she hadn’t done that, in all likelihood I would be dead right now.

My dad 50M is currently on a business trip and was informed by my mom of how bad my bloodwork looked the second I was taken in. He just texted me as said “I’m sorry you’re feeling so sick”. At that point, I didn’t realize how sick I was, because I think the nurses didn’t want to tell me anything that would panic me more because I was already freaking out (I haven’t ever been hospitalized before this so I had just been crying since the moment I was admitted) but I was still hurt that he wasn’t even calling. I told him I wished he was there, but he said he was just really busy with work.

I kept getting worse. They decided I needed surgery, had to transfer me to a different hospital via ambulance, and started having to give me a lot of pain meds and I was attached to an antibiotic drip for days. My dad called me for about 30 minutes on the second day I was there before I was admitted to surgery, but didn’t say much other than he hoped it went well.

Once I was out of surgery and stable, one of my nurses sat down and talked through everything with me and that’s when things sunk in how close I had been to dying. Obviously now I am okay but I think even just realizing that I had a near-death experience after the fact is gonna fuck me up for a while. 

What really upset me is that my dad wasn’t there. My mom told him I was septic and he didn’t immediately tell his boss he needed to be on a flight. He stayed on his stupid business trip, and I could have died without having seen my dad for weeks. And frankly I don’t even think it should have mattered if I was fully septic. I’m his only daughter, and I was hospitalized and in the most pain I’ve ever been in in my life and all I wanted was a hug from my dad and he wasn’t there.

I got discharged from the hospital but I will be staying with my mom for about a week so she can help me recover because my body is wrecked (I can hardly stand for five minutes without feeling out of breath). I texted my dad last night that him not even attempting to be there, or even getting here after the surgery to comfort me, literally anything, really hurt and that him doing that has broken some of the trust I had for him. He just said “I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings”. It’s like he really doesn’t get how bad he fucked up. I don’t know how I’m supposed to move on. I don’t even want to talk to him. I love my dad so much and he’s never let me down like this, but this is the worst possible thing he could have let me down on. I don’t know what to do.

For context, we’re high school sweethearts married for 6 years. We have a child (3M). We’ve been through a lot together. I love her deeply.

Our marriage is in a rough patch. Our quality time as a couple is struggling. We’re in counseling.

We’re working on making time for each other and reaffirming our bond. That’s our current focus in counseling, and we’re assigned intimacy exercises.

Part of these exercises is for us to make a consistent, conscious effort for each other.

We had a staycation to celebrate our anniversary while our son spent the weekend at his grandparents.

The trip was largely nice, and we got to better focus on each other, but it took a turn.

The night of our anniversary we were cuddling, and it turned into more. My wife initiated. She was really into it and expressive, and then out of nowhere she moaned another man’s name who’s in our friend group.

We stopped immediately. There was no mistaking what she said. She looked stunned before recovering and treating it like a texting typo or something.

When I questioned why she’d say another guy’s name, let alone one of our friends, she swore it meant nothing and that she was just consumed with what I was doing to her.

I couldn’t buy it. I don’t believe it meant nothing. Not the passionate way she said it. I believe she was fantasizing about him while being with me.

She insisted it wasn’t like that and was only a slip of the tongue. I asked why his name in particular. First she didn’t know, then said maybe because she was replying to his texts earlier in the group chat.

When I pushed back, she got defensive. She said I was making something out of nothing and how it didn’t need to ruin our anniversary.

I told her nothing she was saying was reaching me, and I needed some time. She tried kissing me and initiating again like nothing happened, but I turned her down. The incident put a damper on the rest of the trip.

We haven’t been intimate since, and any steps we’ve made forward with our exercises have taken a significant leap back.

We’re in a cycle of awkward silence even in front of our son or her ignoring the elephant in the room.

She’s being extra affectionate now, but I can’t shake what happened. I never thought twice about their friendship, but now I’m seeing past interactions differently.

I love my wife. She and our son mean the world to me. I’ve been committed to working on our marriage, but I’m at a loss here.

I feel my wife isn’t being honest and is attempting to rug sweep by pouring on affection. I’m left reconsidering everything.

I don’t know how to navigate forward. I need outside perspectives.

Sometimes more. But his hours got cut at work. He’s been looking for a new job or second one, but hasn’t had much luck. I know he has been looking and putting in effort. That’s not an issue. 

But I sat down with him and said that we really need to talk about this, because I had to go to work today (Monday). I sat down and told him I get he is having a hard time with his hours being cut and trying navigate the job market. But I have a good job and I need to get there. And I can’t afford to uber a car while I heal. We need to find a solution. 

He kept talking in circles with the same reasons I mentioned in the last post. I don’t know exactly what I said, but it was something along the lines of “that is not good enough for me. I don’t accept those reasons and I don’t think they’re true. What is the actual reason? We are married and partners, why am I left hanging like this?” 

He finally told me the truth. Since his hours got cut, he hasn’t been maintaining his car. He had savings and maintained his car when he worked more, but when his hours got cut, he started using his savings to pay his part of the bills. And when it ran low, he finally let me readjust our spending. I pushed for it from the start, but he refused. 

But when his savings ran low, his car started having problems and he couldn’t afford to fix it. He needs new tires. He needs new brakes. The AC stopped working. And he also is well overdue for an oil change. He used to keep up with this stuff, but hasn’t because he is low on money. 

He was ashamed and didn’t want me to use his car or ride in it because he didn’t want me to know how bad it was. He was embarrassed so he never brought it up. So he has been driving an unsafe car and didn’t want me to drive it. 

After a very long talk, we came to a solution. I will buy him used tires. They need to be done, but can wait a week as we look and get this set up. Yesterday we replaced the brake pads and do an oil change. I couldn’t physically help, but I read him steps and look at things when he wasn’t sure. His dad also helped over FaceTime. Between our brains, we figured it out. We decided not to mess with the AC because that’s a comfort thing and not necessary, especially during this time of year. 

So in all, he was having a private struggle I wasn’t aware of. I usually don’t go in his car, so I never noticed. And this morning, he drove me to and from work. And either he will drive me or I will drive myself, with his permission. Depends on the day. 

I knew he was struggling with the lack of income and I have been pushing and pushing for him to let me do more. But he held out due to pride. And his car suffered. And honestly, I think I might do the same thing. I still feel a bit betrayed and the trust has eroded a bit. But at the same time, I also feel like I got closer to him. It’s a weird feeling I can’t fully explain. But in the end, I can get to work with his help.

1kusk5z,relationship_advice,My (F50) best friend is dying. My fiancé (M52) has waited to pick a fight that may end our relationship right before I see her for the last time.,"I can’t make sense of this, and I don’t know what to do or think.

I am beginning to believe that my fiancé is a covert narcissist, or has some severe narcissistic traits. My thoughts are all over the place, please bear with me.

This past week, he has been very moody and difficult. I asked him multiple times if he was OK, and was told he was fine. I am about to make a very difficult trip to visit my best friend who is dying of cancer. This will be the last time I see her; it has been heartbreaking and he knows that this trip will be incredibly hard. I leave in 2 days. This weekend right before I go, my daughter and I went away overnight. It was meant to be later, but because I have to make the emergency trip overseas to be with my best friend, It had to be rescheduled. I mention this only to give background, over timing.

The night before I left with my daughter, he picked a fight over some very trivial things. He was insistent that the storage locker in our building should suddenly be reorganised, and he was furious that it didn’t seem to matter. He ignored me the rest of the evening and came to bed late. I didn’t say anything to him, I admit I was hurt and upset and just wanted to sleep.

Friday morning he sent me a very long text with a list of grievances- very petty things. The storage locker, how angry he was that we left our shoes by the door, that I never vacuum, on and on. The last text he sent said basically, all of these things made him feel like he was going to stop loving me. All day at work I could barely focus, I really couldn’t believe it.

I replied that none of this made sense- and that I thought it was coming from him feeling overwhelmed that I was leaving to be with my friend, and that if he felt that way, a better way to feel connected and supported would be to ask for help and a hug, instead of all of this. And that no, reorganising a storage locker is not an immediate concern when I need to pack and prepare for my flight to be with my best friend for our very last time together. 

He ignored me all day today while my stomach was in knots. I feel like he deliberately chose to ruin the weekend away with my daughter by doing this, causing such upset over something that could wait. The storage locker has literally sat untouched a full year since we moved in. I tried to call him and he was still angry, he said he’d give me 5 minutes to speak, I tried to stand up for myself when he started in on me and my daughter, he hung up on me. An hour later he sent me another text, the first line was in all caps saying for me to “read this carefully”- I knew it was going to be another long, likely mean text, I left it unread all day. I don’t want to read it. I can’t take any more stress or sadness. My daughter doesn’t deserve to have her happy time ruined like this and neither do I.

I now have to face him when I return home tomorrow and I know it’s going to be more fighting. I feel sad, and so alone. I am in for a very hard week trying to keep it together for my friend, making some last memories together at home/hospital. I also know while this is happening, I will now have no support. He knows how much she means to me, how hard it will be and I don’t understand any of this, why he is being this way. I feel like something awful has been revealed, I don’t recognise the man who is meant to love me. How do I to get through this alone? How do I handle the fight I am expecting tomorrow?",2605,0.98,2605,0,2659.0,54.0,289,1748141881.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kusk5z/my_f50_best_friend_is_dying_my_fiancé_m52_has/,False,True

I would never cheat and am trying my best to distance myself from my coworker but it is really hard to do in an office so small and I worry people can tell that I’m acting weird around him.

1n0gvpx,relationship_advice,My (28F) BF (30M) secretly invited his parents to move into our house without telling me.,"Throwaway because BF and friends use Reddit.


So I’ve been with BF for 4 years, living together for almost 2. We bought a house together last year. We had a lot of talks beforehand about boundaries, financial planning, and how important it was for both of us to feel like this was our space.


Last week, BF casually mentioned that his parents “might stay with us for a while.” I assumed he meant a week or two, maybe up to a month. Fine. They live out of state and I know they’ve been struggling financially, so I didn’t think too much of it.


Well, I found out yesterday (from MIL, not even from BF) that the plan isn’t just a visit. BF apparently told them they could move in with us indefinitely. As in they’ve already sold their place and are arriving next weekend with a moving truck.


I was stunned. I confronted BF immediately, and he acted like it wasn’t a big deal. He said, “they’re my parents, of course they have a place here.” When I told him that a permanent arrangement was never discussed and that I didn’t consent to it, he got defensive. He said I was being “cold and ungrateful” and accused me of hating his family.1


For context: I don’t hate his parents. MIL and FIL are fine in small doses, but they’re very traditional and openly critical of me for not being “wife material” (we’re not married, and I have no plans to quit my career). MIL has made comments about how she’d love to help “raise the kids” (we don't want children right now). FIL is the kind of guy who thinks women belong in the kitchen. So the idea of them living with us full-time is…challenging.


I feel completely betrayed. BF made a massive, life altering decision without my input, one that directly impacts our home. He keeps brushing it off like I’m overreacting. I don’t even know how to come back from this.


How should we deal with this?


TL;DR: BF promised his parents they could move into our house without telling me. I feel betrayed and completely overwhelmed.


EDIT: Thanks everyone for the support and advice! It really helped me feel less crazy about this. I’ve already been in contact with my lawyer, and while it’ll take some time, it looks like this should end well for me in the long run.

Since a lot of people asked for an update, I’ll post one once everything is officially sorted out.

1io643b,relationship_advice,"My (68F) mother was given away for adoption. Now her (69M, 72M, 65F) bio-siblings are asking her to care for her (96F) bio-mother.","I (35F) grew up in the U.S., born and raised in Austin, Texas. My father (70M) is Canadian, and my mother (68F) is Greek. Every summer, we vacationed in Greece with my maternal grandparents.

When I was 25, my parents retired and moved permanently to Greece after my mother inherited a house and a significant amount of money from her mother when she passed away. That’s when things took a strange turn.

During the last few months of my grandmother’s life, my mom went to Greece to care for her, as she was no longer able to take care of herself. In her final days, my grandmother revealed a shocking secret: my mom was adopted. She wasn’t the biological child of the parents who raised her. Instead, she was the daughter of my grandmother’s cousin. Apparently, in Greece, decades ago, it was common for struggling families with many children to give a baby to a relative who couldn’t have kids.

My mother was devastated. She grieved the fact that she never knew her real family and that no one ever told her. After my grandmother passed, she decided to move to Greece to reconnect with the biological family she never met. She traveled to the region where her biological mother lived and met her for the first time, along with two older brothers and a younger sister.

Her oldest brother was especially emotional because he vaguely remembered the day they gave my mother away as a baby. But from the start, my mom was hurt that none of them had ever tried to find her. Their excuse was that she had moved to the U.S., and it was difficult to track her down, while her biological mother said she had made a pact with her cousin (my adoptive grandmother) never to reveal the truth. The entire village had been told that my mom had died as a baby, so no one ever questioned it.

For the past ten years, my parents have lived in Greece, and my mom has built a close relationship with her siblings. However, her relationship with her biological mother has remained distant and formal. She never got over the fact that this woman kept all her other children but gave her away—likely because she was a girl. At the time, boys were valued more because they worked the fields and contributed to the family's income, whereas girls were seen as a burden.

Two years ago, I was able to move to Greece as well, since the parents who raised my mom left her a sizable inheritance. It allowed us to live comfortably, and honestly, I preferred the lifestyle here. We live in a beautiful place near the capital, and life is peaceful.

Now, here’s the issue. My mom’s biological mother is now 96 years old and in very poor health. Her biological father passed away decades ago due to political circumstances. Her two older brothers (her sister lives abroad) have been taking care of their mother, but they are exhausted. Their wives are complaining, tensions are rising, and at a recent family gathering, they told my mom that she should also help take care of their mother because it’s ""unfair"" that they are doing it alone.

My father was furious when he heard this and told my mother to cut them off entirely. My mom refuses to take care of this woman—she doesn’t love her, doesn’t feel any emotional connection to her, and can’t forgive her for abandoning her. My mom is not close to this woman's and of course she has no legal claim to any inheritance from this family.

However, she has truly enjoyed her relationship with her siblings and their children and doesn’t want to lose that. She’s feeling pressured, though, and she’s deeply upset by their demands.

When I found out, I was livid. How dare these people ask this of my mother, knowing full well that she was abandoned and that no one even attempted to find her? I feel like they’re manipulating her, and she’s unable to see how unfair this is.

I’m getting married in a month to my fiancé (who is Greek and fully supportive of me), and I am seriously considering uninviting all of them from the wedding. I want to send a clear message that we don’t want contact with them anymore. However, my mother is hesitant—she doesn’t want to escalate things, even though she’s hurting.

I feel like she’s not as attached to these people as she thinks. She’s mourning the idea of the family she never had rather than truly loving these people. And I hate seeing her being taken advantage of.

I always idealized Greece and the strong bonds of family, but now I see that’s not always the case. I’m so disappointed by all of this.

What would you do in this situation? Would you cut them off? Would you disinvite them from the wedding? How can I help my mother navigate this?

(This is a throwaway account because I’m very active on Reddit and don’t want people to know my personal business).


Edit: I forgot to mention something I think is important. My mom suggested they find a senior care facility to put her biological mother in. She even offered to pay a quarter of the price. My biological uncles were ""offended"" because they said it was disrespectful to their mother to put her in a nursing home. (Another Greek thing). Although they are generally financially comfortable, a quarter for a good structure can mean 400-500€/person per month.Which, by Greek standards, is enough. I think their idea of ""help"" is taking her biological mother home for a few months.

1j85nol,relationship_advice,Is it worth possibly putting honey in my bathroom towel so my (29F) husband (30M) learns to get his own and stop using mine?,"My husband (30M) and I (29F) have been married for 8 years. He has little quirks that drive me nuts, but I love him dearly. However, one of these quirks is starting to really irritate me: he **always** uses the used towel I've hung up to dry and use during my next shower. Not only does he use it, but after he's done, he lays it flat on the floor (so he ""doesn't slip"") and doesn't hang it back up.

After numerous times getting out of the shower only to find no towel on the rack, I finally (and kindly) asked him to stop using my towel. He got super defensive. I told him I was getting tired of having to trot through the carpet and into the hallway, naked and cold, to grab a towel after my shower. He told me I was being unreasonable and that the answer to my concern is for me to ""check that my towel is there"" before I shower.

That totally pissed me off. I thought he'd see the **fair** solution to be that he should check for his own towel and go one for himself, but instead, he just thinks I'm ""nagging"" and getting upset over nothing. It honestly just seems childish. And thanks to my overdeveloped sense of justice, I'm debating resorting to the level of his immaturity to teach him a lesson.

My solution is to prank my husband. He hates being sticky. I planned on putting honey all in the inside of ""my"" towel and hanging it up to hide the stickiness from him. When he goes to dry himself off, he'd instantly get sticky. However, this could obviously backfire and make me look like I am overreacting.

So, what do we think? Fight fire with fire, or just start getting a new towel every shower? (I don't think he's going to stop using mine).

We share our locations and sometimes, my location doesn’t update on his end (and vice versa) and it looks like it’s “off”. He’s responded to this happening very unfavorably in the past and would jump to conclusions and think I’m out doing something malicious. 

We’ve talked at length about this and I’ve communicated how his reaction when that happens is not acceptable and he needs to assume best intent. Things in this area have been good, or so I thought. 

After work today, I stopped by the grocery store to pick up a few snacks. I was planning on just running in and out because I wanted to get home, so I kept my phone in my purse instead of directly in my hand. As I’m going through the aisles, I hear a voice say, “Hey”, and to my surprise, it’s my fiancée. I was completely taken aback because I just was not expecting to see him but I was happy to see him nonetheless. 

I quickly realized that this was not a random meeting. I could tell he was upset and he asked me why I wasn’t answering his calls. I had no idea he had been calling as my phone was in my purse and I must have not heard it ring in the busy store. When I took out my phone to show him that it was in my bag and that was the reason I missed his calls, I saw that he had called AND FaceTimed me 10 TIMES.

He said that my location was “off”, which I quickly showed him on my phone that it wasn’t (also, that made no sense because how else would he have known that I was at the store?).

He proceeded to silently follow me around the store as I finished getting my groceries and check out. We awkwardly left separately in our two cars. He sees absolutely nothing wrong with what he did and feels it was justified because he thought something was going on due to the location being “off” and me missing his calls.

I’m furious and feel like he had no right to act this way. It’s completely unhealthy, controlling, and I don’t deserve it.

Has anyone experienced behavior like this with a partner? Was it something you were able to work through, if so? If not, how did you gain the courage to move on?

1i0qups,relationship_advice,My Dad's (M50) Wife Makes Me (F26) Pretend I'm Not His Daughter,"So, this is a bit of a complicated story, but I’ll keep it as straightforward as possible. I (F26) was around 4-5 when my parents divorced. I grew up with my mom, stepdad, and younger siblings, while my dad (M50) moved to another country, remarried, and we eventually lost contact. Without going into too much detail (it’s a 3-5 business day explanation), it was largely due to his new relationship.

Fast forward to recently, I moved to the same country to live with my partner, and I decided to reach out to my dad. We reconnected...but under humiliating conditions. My dad’s wife demands that I’m introduced as a “family friend” to their kids, who don’t know I’m their sister. As you can imagine, visiting is always awkward. I can’t call him “dad” or talk much about myself or my family because my stepmom dislikes hearing about it.

This New Year’s, my partner and I were invited over to their house for lunch. It was going okay (aside from my stepmom’s mom ignoring my partner the whole time) until one of their kids loudly announced, “Everyone here is family except OP and her partner.” I felt so embarrassed and excluded, especially knowing that everyone at the table was already aware of my real identity but was told not to acknowledge it.

To make it worse, my stepmom chimed in with, “Well, what about the dogs?” and my sibling replied, “Yeah, but I meant only we have this last name.” That stung, especially since I’m the OG born with their last name.

This reminded me of a previous gathering where everyone knew me as my father's daughter, but I now realize everyone there likely knew the “secret sibling” situation and had been told not to acknowledge it. Thinking back, it makes me feel delayed embarrassment, like I was the only one not in on this unspoken rule.

It’s left me feeling deeply hurt. I love the kids, and they really enjoy seeing me. They’re always asking when I’ll visit again. My stepmom insists I visit more to “keep the kids happy,” and I’m questioning why I should keep sacrificing my dignity for their comfort. 

I’m debating whether to confront my dad about how excluded I feel or to cut ties altogether. I don’t want to lose all contact with the kids, but I also want to stand up for myself, as this situation has opened up my unhealed abandonment issues.

The silver lining here is how supportive my partner has been through all this. Luckily, he is my family here!

We are very happy and very in love. Last month I had court with my ex husband for child support for our daughter. No big deal, things went smoothly. We didn't and never have had lawyers.

I have not cheated on my fiance, we've lived together and are happy. He is on the verge of leaving, and the marriage is definitely called off.

1ngd17d,relationship_advice,My husband’s (27M) friend bought “better” concert tickets after I (24F) already bought them as a birthday gift,"I (24F) bought my husband (27M) a concert ticket for his birthday and a second one so he could take a friend. We have been together for 6 years and married for 3. We do not have a lot of extra money right now, so $70 per ticket was a big deal for me. I used money from my small business to make it happen because I wanted him to have a special birthday.

Today he called me and said his friend bought better tickets that are closer to the stage, and that is what they will be using instead. The part that really stung is that they used the tickets I bought just to get into the venue, which means I could not even resell them or use them myself if I wanted to.

I am glad he is excited and will have a better view, but it honestly feels like my gift did not matter. I put thought, effort, and money into it, and it ended up feeling like it was tossed aside. This is not the first time I have felt like he does not think about how his actions might affect me, and I am tired of feeling dismissed.

My question: Does anyone else see why this situation might be hurtful? How do you decide if your feelings are valid in situations like this?

UPDATE: His friend bought the tickets without telling him. My husband apologized to me. I also just wanted to clarify that the main reason I was so upset was not because he moved to different seats. It was because of how my husband communicated with me regarding the “better” seats. The way he said it was extremely condescending and purposeful.

My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/QZDvNXi9OI

A lot of the comments advised me to break up but I couldn't just do that. I wanted to at least try and talk it out, foolishly hoping that suddenly we would find common ground and fix everything.

A few days after the fight, he finally called me to set up a meeting to discuse everything. Between the fight and the set up meeting, I've been looking for some solution myself. Per advice on here and from my irl friends, I tried looking for some outside support and I researched some ""well-rated but cheap"" therapists around the area. 

When we finally met, he was the one who really wanted to speak first. He told me that he appreciated that I gave him a few days of space to think things through. Then, he said that he hates to do it to me but he needs to give me an ultimatum. If I want to stay with him, I need to find a job and cut financial support from my family by the end of this month. I could see that no ""but"" in the world could sway him to change that choice for him.

I didn't even have a chance to mention the help I've been researching, kind of freezing for a moment instead. It might sound silly but I've never experienced love dissappear as quickly as it did in that moment. I didn't even know that's possible. His words broke whatever charm he had and made me see that ultimatum for what it truly was - his attempt at managing my life to match whatever idea he had in his mind. All the comments from here flooded my mind as I realised that all of you were correct (sorry for even doubting you all!).

I broke things off immediately. I wish I could say that I told him something smart or cheeky but I literally just said that I'm done and left, tearing up the whole way back home. He called and messaged me a lot since then, saying that maybe we can discuss things, that it doesn't have to be an ultimatum but a goal for the future etc. but I don't think there's a way of fixing things.

I'd be lying if I said that I don't have any love left for him. It was my first serious relationship that I thought might genuinely last but now it turned into my first serious break up. Things are a bit difficult now as I grief the idea of my first love, but I know that I'll get better, sooner or later.

Your advices in the last post were pretty helpful and gave me lots to think about so I'd like to ask you for one more advice. If you were me, what would you tell mutual friends in a situation like this? I'm already getting asked by our friends about what exactly happened but I'm worried that if I tell them the truth, this whole drama will continue/people will be talking about it and I won't be able to emotionally rest from this situation. I'm tempted to just tell them it was a mutual break up or something just to be done with it all and leave it in the past.",2549,0.98,2549,0,2602.0,53.0,203,1762807851.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1otplbc/update_i_23f_told_my_boyfriend_25m_that_i_wont/,False,True
1lggo1b,relationship_advice,My (27M) wife (29F) has given up on our child (10F). I'm not sure how to reconcile. How do I move past this?,"My (27M) family's broken, and I'm trying to reassemble the pieces. I need advice. For context, my wife (29F) and I are childhood sweethearts married now for around 5 years. I know we became parents and got married pretty young, but we've made it work.

My wife's a small business owner. She turned a passion into a career. I'm really happy for her. When she started, I promised her that since my work hours were flexible, I'd hold things down at home so she could focus on building her business.

We were a team until we weren't. My wife's an extreme workaholic, and it's come between our family. We're not in a good place. Our daughter's (10F) caregiving is solely on me.

The time my wife and daughter spend together is made up mostly of short replies or silence. Our daughter isn't disrespectful. She's a good kid. She's just not as comfortable with her mom.

My wife and I have had a lot of talks about the state of our family. With the business well off the ground and her not needing to personally oversee everything as often, we're working on reconnecting. It's been an uphill battle.

Recently, we had a bad fight. She told me she's given up on trying with our daughter. She said she's not good at it, and she's just going to stay in her lane.

I told her she couldn't decide to clock out on our daughter during rocky stints. She said she's emotionally exhausted from repeatedly striking out. She feels she can't do anything right in our daughter's eyes.

She said I have it easy, that our daughter prefers me, and even made sure her whole class knew it. The class jab was about a school assignment. Our daughter had to interview someone she admired, and she asked me. My wife was hurt. She still feels a way about it.

She accused me of not understanding. She comes home to a child she carried not respecting her. That our daughter's an expert critic when it comes to her. She went into a huge rant. The way she talked about her rubbed me the wrong way.

I told her most of her complaints weren't our daughter's creation. She asked me what that meant, and I laid it out that she hasn't gone out of her way to connect with our daughter. She shut me down. She went into how she busts her ass for our family, and the least I could do is show up for her.

All I do is show up for her, including holding down responsibilities that we're supposed to share. We aren't childless. It's no longer those me and her against the world days. I need to show up for our daughter too.

She just kept saying she has a lot on her plate and how I'm supposed to be her peace. I refuted the only peace that ever seemed to matter these days was hers.

She said our daughter and I are two of a kind and began sarcastically apologizing for her sacrifices, and if the business is what's driving us apart, then she'll renounce it. She'd make do. I asked if we could skip her martyr routine and actually talk.

The fight only escalated. I called the fight a complete waste of time, but she interpreted that as me calling her a waste of time. It was the worst fight we had in a while. Our daughter was at her grandparents, so she didn't hear anything.

We're at an impasse. Things are still tense. Idk how to clear the air or how to reach her about our daughter. She can't dismiss her like some disgruntled customer at work. In a lot of ways, I feel like a single parent.

I don't believe she's being honest with herself about our issues. She's a distant figure who has a habit of talking at our daughter instead of to her. There are a lot of broken promises. Nothing ever mended.

She doesn't try engaging. Our daughter loves anime, but my wife doesn't hold back on overly criticizing it in front of her. Our daughter got into K-pop, but to my wife it's just bothersome noise around the house or in the car.

Our daughter has stage fright. Yet she joined a school play because she knows her mom loves theatre. My wife promised her she'd come. She didn't. The worst part was seeing our daughter realize she wasn't. My wife never apologized. She gave her, ""Work was busy. I promise next time"" speech.

She offered to bring our daughter with her on Take Your Child to Work Day. I thought it'd be good for them and a chance for our daughter to see more of what her mom does. But our daughter called me upset and wanted me to pick her up. She said her mom had immediately left her with a subordinate and went awol.

When my wife checked in on her, they fought. She told our daughter that a bratty attitude won't be tolerated in her workplace. She and I had it out later. She apologized to our daughter and blamed blowing up on work frustration. She offered to bring her back another day, but our daughter refused.

My wife always felt she was bad at articulating her feelings. She feels she comes off aggressive. That's partly why she leaves our daughter's caretaking to me. But this fight has me questioning the nature of our relationship.

I don't doubt she loves our daughter. I saw it firsthand during the pregnancy, and in our private conversations, she couldn't stop gushing about her. I felt her love in the little things. Idk something changed over overtime.

My wife isn't close with her parents. She usually has me talk with them on her behalf. She has a mindset that parents/kids don't have to be close. She believes since she turned out fine, so will our daughter.

I'm failing to help their relationship and our own. We barely have quality time. Intimacy is shot. When we're out together, we aren't really together because in public, she's hyperaware and has her business persona on.

Idk what else to do. I'm at a loss. I'm not trying to bash my wife. I just want everyone to be ok. I'm in a fight for my family right now.

How do I mend my wife's and daughter's relationship while also repairing my marriage?

1mf9zu2,relationship_advice,"Update: I (27M) discovered my wife's (30F) family was behind my vicious cyberbullying attack. My wife knew, but she hid it for years. How do I move past this?","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/P4f2MpEjIq

Thank you to everyone who reached out. I (27M) wasn't able to reply to everyone, but it was appreciated. It solidified my wake-up call and helped me see I wasn't overthinking. I wanted to give an update.

Earlier this week, my wife (30F) and I were able to regroup and hash stuff out. I was glad I took the space I did because even though this situation is still hurtful and feels like a massive betrayal, I was in a better position to talk.

My wife thought I was calling it quits, but I told her we were at a crossroads and needed to talk things out. She apologized for what her family did and her role in it. She said she never intended to hurt me. She had convinced herself she was protecting me from more pain. She realizes now she was largely protecting herself.

She admitted she was afraid of telling me the truth because she thought it wouldn't just end the wedding but that I'd end the relationship. She lost other relationships and friendships over her family. She didn't want to lose me too.

Over the years, she wanted to tell me but kept talking herself out of it, and then the cover-up kept getting bigger, and she didn't know how to confess. I told her I didn't agree with her choices, and I wished she had more trust in me and our relationship. I meant it too. I wouldn't have just ditched her.

She asked where do we go from here and promised no matter the outcome, there wouldn't be any more secrets between us. I told her I wanted to work on our marriage, but things needed to change. We couldn't survive with her family looming, and I didn't want our son exposed to them.

She asked what I needed of her. I was never big on ultimatums, and I don't really consider this as one, but I was adamant that any path of us moving forward together would mean radical boundaries with her family.

She was honest that the thought of making this big of a move against her family was scary but said if it's between them and us/our son (2M), then she chooses us.

Her agreement was major for me because I really didn't know where she'd land if she had to choose. I never wanted to put her in that position, but after everything her family did, I feel there was no other way.

The reason I have hope that my wife is being for real is because she sent a text to their group chat stating to stop blowing up my phone and that the no access to our son until further notice is a joint decision she fully supports. I didn't expect that of her. She did it on her own.

Of course, they didn't like it. Now she's labeled as ""disrespectful and ungrateful,"" and how the black sheep eldest sister (35F) and I are poisoning her against them. It was also said, ""What kind of man takes a woman away from her family over a spat?""

This isn't a ""spat,"" nor do I have anything to prove about manhood. They led a whole campaign designed to ruin my life. Their actions are chilling to me. These are the same people who looked me in the eye with a straight face while everything was going on. This is about protecting my family.

My wife has gone low contact. Her family has this mindset that significant others or friends come and go, and it's ""family"" who is the constant and where loyalty should be.

They can't seem to compute that my wife, our son, and I are the core family. They're extended family, and they don't have a claim over our son. Being involved with him is a privilege, not a right.

Idk what their exact issue is with me. They only really tolerated me because of our son. When I first met them, one of my wife's siblings (28F) said they thought my wife was settling for me ""because of age"" and that she could do better.

They're a very tight-knit group, and if one doesn't take to you, then you're not getting far with the rest. It felt like once their minds were made up, there was nothing I could do. I've long since stopped trying to make sense of any of their reasonings. It's a rabbit hole.

Our plan is to move to a new area to create a healthier distance, cement boundaries, and have a fresh start. I brought up therapy too. It's something we've been discussing. We'll be officially starting that soon.

I think moving away will be beneficial for us. It's something my eldest SIL had advised us on. During the wedding planning, she was encouraging my wife to move and create our own space away from their family's isolating circle.

I know my wife is more than just her family. I've seen it firsthand. She shines so bright when away from their influence. That's what I meant when I said she was the most loving, unselfish, and decent person I've ever met.

If I'm being honest, idk how things will turn out. I'm still hurt, I still feel betrayed, and my wife's facing her own challenges with low contact, but I want to be hopeful. I don't want to close the door. I'm hoping we can heal together.

Thank you again to everyone for the support. I found not everything is as isolating as with the majority of my in-laws. It means more than you know.

TL;DR Update to: My marriage is in a bad spot. Idk how to trust my wife again. I was the target of some relentless and vicious cyberbullying for months. It impacted my life and my mental health. I put it behind me until my wife confessed that her family was the culprit. She showed me proof in their group chat. I knew I wasn't their favorite person, but I never realized they hated me. My wife swears she didn't initially know and that she made them stop. But she still hid it for years. She begged me to understand and said that she was trying to make things right for us and our son. I asked for space to clear my head. She hasn't exactly respected that request. I'm really trying to move past it, but I feel so betrayed by her. Idk if I'm being unfair. I want to make our marriage work, but I'm questioning everything.

1kemh2v,relationship_advice,Saw my husband’s (M27) disgusting text about a female coworker and idk how to feel about it (F25) how would you feel if your husband said he’d eat it about a coworker?,"So last night I had gone through my husband’s phone, not out of looking for something to be mad at but just out of purely being nosy. As I’m looking at his text between him and his friend he works with, they keep bringing up this one coworker, his friend talked about how many guys have slept with her and my husband responded with “wish it was me” then his friend had sent a meme that he related to her and my husband had said “ he’d still smash” mind you were newly married and this made me extremely uncomfortable. Not even said just angry because regardless if the conversation was just “guy talk” I don’t think it’s right for my husband to be saying those things about a coworker not only just her but another coworker as well saying he’d still eat it if she smelt funny. 
Its kinda funny too because he had a dream a couple nights ago about me going through his phone and accusing him of cheating, maybe he’s psychic. I’m just lost feeling wrong that I went through his phone but also him saying those things. 

** sorry for the spelling mistakes in the replies, I’m just incredibly angry and annoyed so those feelings are just taking over. I’m just beyond disgusted and disappointed because it has me looking at him very differently at this moment especially because we’ve been married for a month now. 

*** Update: my update is getting lost in the comments but we talked about it, he said he can’t trust me since I looked through his phone which is valid. He said that I started an issue over nothing because he was “trolling” with his friend.  even though it wasn’t about him finding another person attractive, It was the words used verbatim that he wishes he could’ve fucked a girl and that he’d still eat a girl out if she smelt funny. That is what made me uncomfortable and upset, I know we as people can find others attractive and that is fine because we’re human. 
I do feel wrong for snooping and finding what I didn’t want to find, but I’m glad because it’s allowed me to create a boundary of what I want to handle. 
For those asking if I’d be comfortable with him going through my phone, my answer to that is I completely would be fine with it because I’m open and honest about what I say and do. Not only that, I don’t say sexual things about co workers to my friends. 
There’s a difference in saying these things about a celebrity, random person, etc, but this was a co worker he said these things about. That’s what I’m uncomfortable with. 
I still feel valid in how I feel I will say just because there were far more disturbing things said by him and his friend that I don’t necessarily want to post. I am planning on doing something to figure this out 

AGAIN! This isn’t about him finding her attractive, it is about saying he’d fuck her 4 times in that text thread.

This has turned into such a long post lmao! But UPDATE!! Mentioned divorce once we started talking about it again and he started saying he feels like there’s a leash on him due to me not wanting him to say those “jokes”, once I mentioned divorce he’s been blowing me up saying he’ll be a good husband and stop saying those things, saying that he was wrong for those things. , calling my mom up, and calling his mom up but I’m not budging, because why make those jokes in the first place, I don’t think he believed how serious I was about being upset til he started saying he feels like he’s on a leash.

1i2ne64,relationship_advice,"My (18F) pregnant sister (26F) thinks I was insensitive after I didn't accommodate her chair preferences. Can I get advice, please?","Throwaway because I don't want this linked back to my main.

It was my grandma's birthday last Sunday and my parents hosted it at our house since it's the biggest and can accommodate all of our extended. I have 2 older siblings, my sister (26) and my brother (29) but they're both out of the house now, both of them married, my brother has a little boy who is 2 and my sister is 7 months pregnant.

Dad and I got up early at like 5am to help mom with all the setting up and the food prep because there was going to be around 20 people coming over plus kids. We removed the fancy dining room chairs and placed them up in my bedroom because mom was worried about the kids getting stuff on them (happened before and was a mf to clean) and we replaced them with the regular chairs we have for events like this one but we did leave out two of the fancy ones downstairs for my grandpa and grandma since they're both elderly and they would be more comfortable for them.

No one batted an eye at this when they came over but my sister had a frown on her face but didn't comment (By the way, it wasn't the first time the set up was like this and no one has a problem with it.)

Anyway, by the time my parents and I sat down to eat with everybody at 2pm, we were dead on our feet and I just wanted a nap. After the lunch and clearing up the tables, everyone was scattered around the house, a lot of them were watching the kids outside and I was helping my grandma to the bathroom. When we came back, my sister was sitting in grandma's chair and we she saw us she got up with a huff and commented that we should have kept all the fancy chairs downstairs. I told her why we didn't, but she just rolled her eyes.

After a bit I was helping my mom bring out dessert and my sister was sitting on a regular chair and she sighed loudly and asked me to go upstairs and get her one of the fancy ones. I just looked at her and ignored her because by that point I had a headache, I was bone tired and was ready for the whole day to be over. She got up and followed me and told me again and I told her again that it was mom's decision, take it up with her. She didn't want to. My brother who was also helping at that point also told her to drop it because he could see my annoyance. She did NOT like that and told him to stay out of it.

After the cake was cut and pieces were making rounds I sat down to eat my piece only to have her take it away and ask me AGAIN, holding it hostage as if I were a kid. I suppressed the urge to smash it in her face and told her that they're in my room, have her husband go get her one and to leave me the fuck alone. If it gets dirtied by the kids then it's on her to explain to mom. She perked up at that but asked ME to go get it since he was eating cake. I was done. I got up, kissed my grandma and grandpa on their cheeks, excused myself from everyone and went up to my room and locked my door.

My BIL tried going up after like 15 minutes to get the chair but I turned a deaf ear to his knocking. The next day I got a text asking why I tattled to mom when all she wanted was to be comfortable and I was being insensitive at our grandma's bday. Funny thing is that I didn't tell mom because she had enough on her plate. It was my brother, and my mom had apparently had a talk with her because of it. Even though it happened days ago, I'm still annoyed but I also feel a little guilty and think that I overreacted a bit.

1nwfa0j,relationship_advice,Update: My (22f) birth control was tampered with by my boyfriend (22m). I'm pregnant. I don't know what to do. ?,"I haven't proofread this (sorry) so please excuse any screwups 

So much has happened since I last posted here, as I'm sure you can imagine. Long story short, ex's family is a MESS. Getting in touch with legal professionals and talking to police has been so overwhelming, but I am lucky enough to be working with some absolute angels. I can't get into the weeds of all that in this post. It doesn't really look great, but it's hard to say what'll happen since everything is so fresh. Courts move at a snail's pace, but if I'm ever in a position to give an update I will. 

Now for everything else I guess. 

Ex confessed to messing with my birth control. I have a close childhood friend who my ex took to early in our relationship. Looking back, ex definitely had a little bit of a thing for her. I think everyone who knows her kinda does (myself included). She is compassionate, amaidable, gorgeous, the whole package. Anyone who knows her well knows she is not to be fucked with. Point is, he trusted her a lot. A few hours after I made my post, she and I got together and schemed. We very gently prodded him over text. He barely bent before he broke. We deliberately made the text messages sound super nonjudgmental, like she was on his side. She threw me under the bus a little bit and implied she felt closer to him than to me to really sell the act. I can't go into detail about how the conversation went down (legal shit), but I do have the screenshots and I will definitely be posting them if I can once all of this is over and done with (if I remember to, that is).

I don't think ex would've ever spilled his guts if she hadn't been in the picture. Friend has been by my side pretty much ever since. I mentioned at the end of my original post that I've been staying with my parents, and they have been gracious enough to help me until I'm back on my feet no matter how long it takes.

I quit my dead end job (I've been meaning to anyway), and I've been doing school online. Friend brought her mini work-from-home set up and we've both just been sharing a bed in my childhood room most nights. Also we sorta kissed. Only once. It was nice. I had a big fat crush on her for like the entirety of high school. Idk what else to say about that. I won't bore you guys with the details since I know it's not what you're here for lol. I don't wanna tell my friends about it yet, so you guys get to hear first. I'm not dying to get into something serious at the moment, but I won't complain if it ends up going somewhere. 

I think some part of me has known for a while that my last relationship was comphet. Leaving felt like such a monumental task. In some messed up way, this has been a blessing. I was thrust into a situation where the only reasonable option was to drop him like hot shit, which was kinda long overdue.

Parents are also way chiller than I thought they'd be. I mentioned in my last post that they're kinda religious, but they chilled out a lot after I moved out. Faith is still a big part of their lives, but they're less into following the book to a T, and more into making the worId a better place. My dad got really into virtue ethics and I think it's been good for him. I had a conversation with my mom about everything, and she has been nothing but supportive.

We had a girls day with her, my aunt, my friend, and my sister a couple of days before my appointment. Being surrounded by love made everything easier. Appointment went well, no complications, and everyone made sure I was taken care of while I recovered physically and emotionally. I can't even begin to tell you all how grateful I am. I feel like everything has gone as well as it possibly could've in the wake of an absolute shit storm.

As for ex's family, holy shit. This isn't the first time this happened. Ex's cousin did almost the exact same thing, but his gf (now wife) kept the kid and married the shitbag. I've been talking to her, but I don't want to air out all of her trauma and dirty laundry on the internet. Lots going on for her. If she gives me permission to talk about it here, I might update once the dust settles.

I don't have much else to say, except to thank you all SO INCREDIBLY MUCH for giving me the kick in the ass I needed. I've received so much kindness from this community, both in comments in DMs. There were so many comments I didn't get the chance to read, but everything I saw was so sweet. Not a single unkind word. I hope you all continue to be such gems. I hope the goodness you've imparted onto my life comes back around.

1klusgt,relationship_advice,He [41M] wants me [30F]  to get my tubes tied because we said one and done but things changed after his affair. How do I explain that?,"We have a son who just turned three. For most of his baby years, I was in survival mode. I agreed we’d be one and done when I was pregnant, he didn’t want to be an old dad and I struggled a lot with the pregnancy. He also grew up as an only child. 

Then when our son was about six months old, my husband confessed he’d had an affair that lasted almost 5 months. He said he was sorry and that he was struggling a lot and found being a dad  claustrophobic. He was very remorseful and had confessed on his own accord. 

What followed was a year I can barely remember. We had a trial separation, did couples therapy and individual therapy. 

The entire experience robbed me off the newborn stage. I remember planning our son’s first birthday party with one tab open for balloon garlands and the other researching divorce lawyers. We had a nanny for our son and at times it felt like she was the second parent. 

And now my sister just had a baby a year ago. A little girl. Our son is obsessed. He talks about her all the time. He begs to facetime her. We visit every couple of months, even though she’s three states away, and every time we leave, he cries and asks when we’ll see the baby again and if we will have his own baby sister.

I think he’ll be a good older brother, I always wanted a daughter, I love our son and wouldn’t trade him for anything but I have been having doubts about whether one and done is for me. My difficult pregnancy is one of many things holding me back though.

I told my husband this and he’s adamant that we shouldn’t and said I should get my tubes tied because I previously agreed I should mostly after the trauma of pregnancy. 

I’m not saying a baby would fix anything but we can afford to. With our son we had a nanny that I still keep in touch with so we would have help. I don’t want to have a second for all the wrong reasons but I do want to relive what I missed out on.

1ots3gn,relationship_advice,How can my husband 61M and I 60F help our son 32M move past his high school girlfriend?,"My husband and I are at our wits’ end with our son’s inability to get over his high school girlfriend. They broke up in 2011 (yes, you read that right! It has been that long since he even saw this girl!), after having dated for about two years.

At the time I did fully empathize with him. He had moved away for college while she stayed behind; they made efforts to see each other and talked frequently, but as I understand it, she began a relationship with someone else while she was still in one with my son. She at least had the decency to end things with my son in person, and did admit she was wrong in not having broken up with him before taking up with the new boyfriend. Nonetheless, my son was devastated by this, and we supported him as best we could, at the time.

I think he might have moved on in time, were it not for the fact that his ex-girlfriend then almost immediately married the young man; I believe he was in the military, hence the young marriage. This fact sent my son into a spiral which has continued in some form or another over the last fourteen years. Back then I thought the marriage was unlikely to last long, and that when it ended he’d feel some kind of vindication and drop it, but our son checks her social media frequently (though we have strongly advised him against this) and says they are still married and have children.

My son has had a few girlfriends in the last fourteen years, but none that have lasted long, and even during the times he has been attached he still continues to talk about how wronged he was. We see him very frequently, and while his ex is not our only topic of discussion, she does come up in some way almost every time we see him. We probably know more about her life now than we did while they were dating.

We have allowed him to vent, but did eventually set boundaries around abusive language; for a time he favored a few words to describe her (beginning with S and W mainly) that I don’t care for, and to his credit he has stopped that, but for all I know he’s only stopped saying them around us. In general we employ the tactic of “nod and agree, then change the subject”. It’s like he cannot resist an opportunity to bring her up.

This past weekend, things came to a head when our son made an offhand comment about his ex. My husband responded by shouting at our son to get over it already, that we were sick of hearing about a girl he dated more than a decade ago, and that he needed to stop all mention of her around us. I asked my husband to go in another room and take a breather, and when he did I suggested to my son that if he truly cannot move past this, that we help him seek some sort of therapy or other intervention. He responded by immediately leaving and has not responded to any of my texts or calls since.

I wish my husband had not shouted, but I am right there with him; this has gone on too long and we have enabled the behavior. I’ve even wondered if he’d still be bringing her up if we had put our foot down about this before. Any time we have pushed back in any way or challenged any assertion he made about his ex/their relationship, he has become very upset, so we defaulted to ‘just let him vent’. I do not think he has done any more than stalk her social media, but I feel this has long been unhealthy and may require an intervention of some kind. I’m hoping he comes around in the next few days, but am unsure how to broach the topic again without further upsetting him.",2515,0.98,2515,0,2567.0,52.0,445,1762813648.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ots3gn/how_can_my_husband_61m_and_i_60f_help_our_son_32m/,False,True

There have still been ups and downs in the last few months, but I was starting to feel uneasy again.

Yesterday marked the first anniversary of my dad’s passing, and during a video call with my wife, I told her I missed my family and my dad and that I was feeling depressed. Instead of support, she got angry—probably because she was having a stressful day with the kids.

I don't usually date men who are only separated, but we just clicked. One thing I've asked from the beginning is whether or not he wants to have more kids because I'm child free for medical reasons. He's always said he wasn't bothered either way.
The relationship with his children is very strained and they don't like going to see him.

Now the divorce is complete. I've warned him that the he'll spiral having had friends go through the same thing (which is usually why I don't date men in this period), but he was adamant he was going to be fine. 

He isn't, he's totally spiralling. I've suggested that he go back to therapy, but he doesn't want to. 
I've said not to just have these thoughts and feelings swirling around in his head and to talk if he needs to. 
He's started talking to me about his feelings and one of them is that he wants to have more kids. 
Now, he said this in a stream of consciousness in a voice note.

A few days ago, my husband started experiencing testicular pain and tested positive for chlamydia. I was so confused about the result until he finally confessed that he received oral sex from a masseuse two years ago during his bachelor party.
He said that was the only time it ever happened and that he’s felt guilty ever since—especially now, knowing it could affect me and the baby. That’s why he chose to confess.
I’m currently 3 months pregnant. Even if I test positive, it can be treated easily. But what hurts me the most is that I trusted him with all my heart. He has always been a loving and caring husband.
I really don’t want to leave him over one mistake, but the fact that he let it happen and then hid it from me for two years is killing me inside.

1opa0od,relationship_advice,I (34F) don’t know what to do after my husband (32M) kissed his “work wife”?,"My husband (32M) and I (34F) have been married for 6 years and we have a son. For the most part, we have the kind of marriage that I assume lots of people have. There are good times and less good times.

For the last 4 years or so, we have both just been really busy. We both have busy jobs, we have been renovating our house, and most of our time is spent parenting. It’s neither of our faults exactly, but we just never have time for each other. We haven’t gone on a real date in years and I can’t remember the last time we were intimate.

I think that’s part of why I was so heartbroken when my husband came home from work late one day recently and told me that he had kissed a woman he works with. He told me that they had both had a momentary lapse in judgement and that he was really sorry. He told me it was with this girl that I’ve met several times and I always called his work wife because they talk to each other so often.

It obviously fucking sucks in every way possible, and I yelled at him and he promised to distance himself from the woman and not talk to her. When it happened, I told him we were done and that I wouldn’t stay married to a cheater, but now I just don’t know. I hate him so much right now, but I also just can’t imagine going forward in my life without him.

Eventually, I’ll make my own decision, but I’d love to hear if you guys have any advice.

1kvltg1,relationship_advice,[Update] I 25F accidentally rejected my coworker/friend 29M and regret it,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/aXTF11ejEx

First of all thanks everyone for the great advice I really appreciate it. Well the most common advice I got was to go and be honest and plan a date for him. So I wanted to do that but in a more intimate setting so I was feeling bold and got his favorite (Wingstop) and went to his apartment and just knocked. I would pay to have footage of the look on his face cause he was so taken aback lol. 

Anyway I said do you mind if I come in? He was a bit hesitant but he said yes then we sat and I explained everything that I said in this post. How I just freaked out cause I was taken aback and also scared. Scared about anchoring myself to a place away from my family, scared to lose my only friend, scared that the idea of having me would end up being better than actually having me. I told him that after having time to process the idea I am very much into it and see all the ways we are great for each other. I told him how grateful I was for everything he has done for me. And that if I reacted negatively it had nothing to do with him and everything to do with me. 

So when I finished my speech he apologized (this man is too good for me). He was like okay I’m also sorry I didn’t mean to ice you out I was just disappointed and needed a little time and I would’ve eventually started speaking to you again like I would still rather be your friend than not. 

And that was a big relief cause I saw comments of people saying « well if he was just hanging out with you to get in your pants then he’s not your friend or he’s immature ect.. » well he proved that he’s not and that he’s great actually :) 

Another thing is people said well if you didn’t like him romantically at all then you should just leave him alone or you just miss the attention. I genuinely just didn’t even entertain the idea because the nature of our relationship was so platonic. In my brain I was just like well we’re just friends if he was interested he would’ve said so or shown it, flirted, or been more tactile. I just accepted that as the reality so him saying he actually did like me was a complete surprise.

Anyway so we have officially decided to give it ago. We had a pretty deep convo about where we see our lives going and it’s very much in alignment with each other. I’m super happy but still fearful I admit but I just keep telling myself that if I don’t try I’ll regret it. I still have a date that I’m planning involving all of his favorite things that I’m working on in my back pocket cause I still feel like I have some making up to do. Oh and we ended up kissing and it was great :) ",2496,0.97,2496,0,2576.0,80.0,86,1748234561.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kvltg1/update_i_25f_accidentally_rejected_my/,False,True
1hi307f,relationship_advice,"How can I, 31F, better support my gay husband, 31M, who doesn't want his family to abandon him?","My husband, 31M, and I, 31F, have been married for 6 years now. My childhood wasn’t exactly pleasant, there was a lot of violence, traumatic experiences and substance abuse. All those things left pretty deep scars, including a fear of any kind of physical intimacy or relationship. My husband on the other hand grew up in a very strict and conservative home and his parents have always demanded a lot from him. 

I was bullied a lot at school, and I didn’t really have friends until I met my husband at high school when we had to do a project together. He was a popular guy, and I kind of expected him to be a jerk, but he was actually very nice. 

We became friends and eventually he trusted me enough to tell me his biggest secret. He was gay. I didn’t have any kind of problem with that, but he told me that his parents and other family members would disown him if he ever told them the truth. They’d made it very clear how they felt about “those people” and his mother had even said once that she would be nothing but ashamed if any of her kids ever turned out to be “that kind of thing”. 

So, after receiving a lot of pressure from his parents, my husband asked if I could pretend to be his girlfriend and drop by a few times so they would get off his back. I agreed, but things kind of escalated from there. My husband loves his parents and siblings very much and despite their attitude, he doesn’t want to lose them. I’ve told him I didn’t have any interest in physical intimacy or relationships, so he asked if I could consider marrying him.

He’s my best friend and I love spending time with him, so after many long conversations I agreed. It actually wasn’t a bad solution, we live together, but we have separate bedrooms and he’s free to date whoever he wants. He’s not comfortable openly dating men, so it’s mostly during business trips. 

I feel bad for him for having to hide a part of himself from his family, but he’s made it clear he’s not going to tell them. I guess my question is, how can I better support him? We’re friends and he knows he can talk to me about anything, but I feel I’m not doing enough.",2496,0.95,2496,0,2635.0,139.0,232,1734642101.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hi307f/how_can_i_31f_better_support_my_gay_husband_31m/,False,True

1kfny5u,relationship_advice,How do I (24 F) come clean to my (25M) boyfriend of 2 years about a lie I’ve kept going since 8th Grade?,"I’m aware this is a terrible thing to do and I will live with the guilt of it my whole life and cannot apologize enough to those affected by this. When I was starting 8th grade I went into a completely new school district due to bullying at my old school. I still had one friend from my old school who I texted daily. We’ll call her Molly. Molly and I had this idea to see how long I could convince the students at this school that I was color blind (I am not) and we decided it would be easiest for me to pretend to see in just black and white (which I’m pretty certain is not a thing) so I wouldn’t get stumped if people “tested” me. 
Unfortunately for me I was quite convincing and nobody ever called me out if they doubted me. I went on to fall out of contact with Molly because she stabbed me in the back and was then worried everyone would hate me when I came clean alone without her to defend that we had come up with it together. At this point I had made a whole new friend group who believed me and the entire school that knew me also “knew” that I was colorblind.
Fast forward to meeting my now boyfriend, nothing special just lucky on a dating app. He was everything I was looking for and I couldn’t have been more happy and I still am. We have never fought in the two years we’ve been together apart from silly debates about SpongeBob plots and what kinds of food is better. I love him more than anything and I want to spend my life with him. However, I don’t believe I deserve to have that. When we started getting serious he met my best friend since high school. And in them meeting my color vision came up and rather than come clean to my best friend I decided to lie to my boyfriend and I feel terrible to this day. 
My issue is I don’t believe I can continue to go forward when there is this low hanging over the whole relationship for no reason. I feel I have done the equivalent to cheating on him by lying for our entire relationship. I know I have to come clean and I am going to and hope for the best I suppose I simply would like advice on how to best go about it. 
(His family also believes I am color blind)
 
Feel free to rip me a new one in the comments I deserve it for faking a disability and I take full responsibility and will not claim I was a child and didn’t understand. I knew I was wrong I regret it. 

Edit: those telling me to add to the lie are not helping (I know some are jokes) my issue isn’t I’m scared he’ll figure it out. I want him to know. I simply want a smart way of going about telling him. 



UPDATE: I spoke with my boyfriend last night while having pizza, I simply said what I typed above as many people suggested and after a lot of blank stares, silence and a simple “what” he started laughing. I was laughing nervously and I was still unsure if he was going to get up and leave my house but wanted to laugh at me first (dramatic I know but that’s me. He calmed me down (because he’s a saint) and told me I’m stupid, that was weird and he’s still slightly shocked but ultimately he didn’t care. We continued eating our pizza, watched the next Marvel movie in our lineup and had a completely relaxing night. I waited to update still unsure if he was staying with me after a nights rest on it but I’m happy to say it’s as if nothing has changed and I couldn’t be happier. 
I saw a few comments appalled that I was sorry for lying to my boyfriend but nobody else. I will admit my post did make it seem that way and maybe he was the catalyst to make me take the steps towards coming clean but I do deeply regret lying to my friends as well. On that note I told my best friend as well (over the phone because she lives hours away at college right now) and she also thought it was hilarious and shocking I managed to keep it up this long. She also said she wasn’t upset with me and it changed nothing between us apart from the relentless teasing I’m sure is coming my way. I haven’t told my boyfriend’s family yet as I want him and I to decide together how to go about it because he obviously knows them better than me although I have already come to love them as my own family. I may update later on when I do tell them all but I’m not sure. Thank you for all the advice even though some of it was hard to hear I accept that and will move on and be better going forward.

1o7t4cx,relationship_advice,My husband’s son (28M) confessed his shameful secret that my husband would want to know about. How do I (34F) respect my duty to my husband without ruining my relationship with his son?,"My husband (Daniel) is 60, didn’t know where to add that in the title. I know that’s a big age difference and Reddit is against that but I met Daniel when I was a grown woman in my 30s. On top of that, my husband looks better than most men my age, so.

So my husband and his son aren’t very close. Daniel wants to mend their relationship, but it’s difficult because there’s a sort of cultural clash between them. Daniel was raised in a culture where affection is shown through sacrifice and discipline while his son is American. So his son expects more emotional openness and outright affection than Daniel is really capable of. This has definitely lead to a lot of resentment and when I came along, that sadly made things worse. His son was really unhappy about it. His son just takes an issue with me, specifically. And he’s been taking that out on his dad. 

He usually ignores me and when he doesn’t ignore me, he can be nasty. Daniel has asked me to do my best to put up with it and somehow try to have a good relationship with him. I’ve tried and I think maybe that finally helped.

Daniel is visiting his mom and I was unable to go, I can’t take that much time off work right now. So I’ve been home alone except for the few days when his son decides to stay here. His son doesn’t have his own place, he usually stays with his mom but sometimes he’ll be here. 

I don’t really want to get into the details of what happened but the other day, he was here. And I sort of understood what was going on. But later that night he got drunk and we had a long conversation and at some point he basically confessed what he’s been doing. Let’s say he’s been gambling, even though that’s not it. He told me that he’s been gambling for many years, he’s spent a lot of money on it. He doesn’t feel like he can stop. He even sought therapy for it, and that didn’t help him. He feels like he can’t have a normal life because he has this constant urge to gamble.

The morning after that, he came up to me and literally started crying and asked me not to tell his dad anything. But I know Daniel, I know his values. I know he wouldn’t want his son to live like this. 

His son says Daniel wouldn’t do anything to help him, but I believe that’s because he perceives Daniel to be as cold and uncaring when he really isn’t. I don’t know what Daniel could do to help, but I know that he would want to know. 

I thought I’d try to convince his son that he needs to tell him what he’s been going through. But his son went back to his mom’s place, he isn’t here now. And I wonder if he’d avoid me even more now that I know all of this.

I feel like just telling Daniel might make his son go no contact, and ruin their relationship altogether. And if I don’t tell him, his son might like me, which would make Daniel happy. But it feels like I would be betraying my husband if I just sat on this.

We’ve been dating for about five months. He is 19M and I am 18F. A few days ago he asked me to come over to watch a movie I hadn’t seen him in person all week so I went. I wore a brown hoodie and sweats with a white tank underneath. At first everything seemed normal. Then he asked me where I’d been on Wednesday. I said I’d basically been home all day. He snapped, accused me of lying, and said he’d heard I was with another guy.

I told him I wasn’t with anyone I don’t even have guy friends but he kept yelling that I was lying and that his friend had seen me with someone. I stood up and told him if he didn’t believe me I would leave. Instead of letting me go, he grabbed my arm and demanded I answer. We argued for about fifteen minutes and I eventually pushed him lightly because I was frustrated and scared.

The next thing I remember is him grabbing my neck. Don’t forget this man is almost 6’0 and I’m 5’2 and he’s very athletic but still skinny. He wrapped his hand around my throat and slammed my head into the wall. I could not breathe. His grip was huge and he was so strong I couldn’t pull away. He was cursing at me as I felt myself fading I remember kicking and trying to fight, but he didn’t budge. He punched the wall right next to my head so hard it made a deafening noise and I screamed. He then threw me onto the bed and just sat there while I cried. I ran into the bathroom and bawled.

He came after me, apologized profusely, grabbed my face, begged me to forgive him, and kept trying to stop me from leaving. I left as soon as I could. As I walked out I realized the punch missed my face by inches it could have been so much worse. My neck has visible red marks where he had his hand around it.

I’m shaken and confused because he’s always been gentle before this felt like he became someone else. I don’t know whether to call the police, press charges, or go to the hospital. I’m worried about my safety and what the right next steps are. I’m terrified and confused. What’s the best way to protect myself and handle this situation moving forward?

1kqhjr0,relationship_advice,My (36F) husband (33M) found out his child never excited this weekend.,"Throwaway and names changed. 

In the most “what the fuck” moment of my life, my (36f) husband Eric (33M) found out his 12 year old son does not exist. At all. This isn’t a huge surprise, I’ll get into that, but it’s still shocking. 

I found this out over the weekend, Saturday afternoon, and have obviously been consoling and comforting my husband. I need to process this but also get advice on what the fuck to do, other than therapy because it is literally where my husband is while I post this. 

When Eric was in college he did a study abroad in Europe and there he met Katie. Katie claimed to be from a very well off family from south east Asia. My husband says he believe it is true because “she had the spending habits and flat to prove it”

after writing this out I feel like it’s better to put this in a timeline 

July 2012 - July 2013 Eric is living in Europe 

Early September 2013 - Eric receives a FB message from Katie informing that she is pregnant with his child and they have a conversation and she informs him she will be terminating the pregnancy. 

End of September 2013 Katie blocks my husband on every possibly form of communication he can get. At the time, he took this as she was upset about the situation and wanted 0 contact. He was frustrated she never followed up and told him about the termination or how it went, despite the fact he asked, but moved on with his life. 

March 2016 Katie unblocks eric and tells him that she’s sorry for disappearing and that her family, who is very traditional, learned of her pregnancy and ended up bringing her back to their home country. She sends photos of a child and tells Eric that she couldn’t go through with the termination and that they have a son. Katie tells Eric that she was seeing someone and that her boyfriend was raising the kid like his own. 
(I would like to say, it was a very huge shock for my husband, he was 23 and fresh out of college he’s told me numerous times he regrets what I’m about to say) 
Eric tells Katie he’s not interested in having a relationship with their son. He’s willing to send money/medical documents/family information but that he didn’t find the need to be apart of the kids life if there was a father figure there. Katie EXPLODES on him and blocks him again. 

November 2016 - Katie unblocks him again and apologizes for her actions. She says that if Eric ever wants to learn about their kid that she’ll be waiting and that their child is amazing. From November 2016 - July 2018 they have monthly check ins. They are not talking a lot but Eric knows about what is happening with his child and in Katie’s life. Katie had always said that the child knew Eric was his father and that her partner was not.

October 2017 - I meet Eric on a weekday. We had our first date the following Friday and it was full steam ahead. I learned about Katie and the kid pretty early on but we didn’t talk much about it. I asked him why he wasn’t involved and he said that he was either in college or right out of college and didn’t feel like it would be healthy for the child. Even though he was the child’s dad, it didn’t seem fair to explain to a young kid he was only going to be a dad through the phone. He didn’t have money to travel and see the kid, until 2017. (We live in America) He felt like Katie never seemed interested in having him personally involved in the child’s life, so he kept it like it was. When I learned she never asked for money but just simply wanted to know about medical history I didn’t find it THAT weird. Was it odd? Sure. But it didn’t feel like a scam or anything. 

July 2018 - Eric and I have a conversation about a time table. during this conversation I bring up the question of kids and what does his life with his actual kid he has look like. I brought up the fact that maybe it was time for him to meet said child. We decided we would plan a vacation to south east Asia, see a few countries and have one of those stops be meeting his child. 

a few days later, Katie had reached out to Eric about something and Eric told her we were wanting to come. She got all defense saying “I don’t know her” “you want to bring another woman around my child” “you can’t just pick when to be a parent” insult after insult and then communication was just over. Blocked on every platform. When I went to go message her, I found that I was blocked on everything. 

So from here until the next timeframe of when they talk, I’d just like to say my husband did try in many ways to get in touch with her. 

January 2019 Eric and I get engaged.
July 2019 - I get pregnant, I lost the baby but this was a very hard time for Eric. Obviously miscarriages are hard for every father but Eric told me that he felt like he was losing a kid all over again. Eric got very depressed and this is when he began therapy. 
Eric being upset, upset me and with that, the loss of a baby, and wedding planning, I finally confess to my parents all of this. (My parents knew about the kid but not ALL of it) My dad is a lawyer and is very well connected and two days later I am sitting down for a lunch meeting with my dad, and his two buddies one who is an immigration lawyer and one who is family law. They asked me a thousand questions and the immigration lawyer asks if we have a birth certificate. I say no, he’s asked if I’ve ever seen one, i said no, and he said “then how do you know the baby exists?” I think he said it as a half joke. But then he asked us why she had never asked for American citizenship for the child. I said I don’t think she cares. And he informed me that the country Katie is from, even affluent people from that country, would be looking to get access to that citizenship for their child. Especially because in the long run it would help for family sponsorships. (I do not know how true that is, that is just what I was told) 

I go to a therapy session with Eric and explain this to him and he basically tells me that he knows the baby is real and he doesn’t understand why Katie is acting like this. And I just decided to let it go. 

September 2019 - Eric and I get married. 

While on our honeymoon Katie unblocks us and says “well I guess we’re all a family now” and communication begins to start back up. For about 2 months conversation are going great. Eric actually TALKS to his child and Katie invites us to come meet the child finally but then Covid hits and we’re stuck in America. 

During this time it’s about the same as it always was, Katie checks in about once a month, but when we ask to talk to the child more, she says it’s too confusing/he doesn’t speak good English/time difference. 

I got pregnant April 2020 and we chose to not tell anyone outside of our parents and siblings. Didn’t post about it. Didn’t upload photos of the bump. Just chose to break the news with a picture of our son, born Jan 2021, and the caption “Survived the pandemic, now facing sleepless nights” 

I don’t know the exact time we posted it but if we posted it at like 10:15 am by 10:30 am we got a message from Katie saying how sick and twisted we were. Saying our caption proves how disgusting I am, making light of a pandemic that killed thousands of people, saying how awful i was for not telling her so she could prepare her son to become a big brother. 
And then she the personal attacks on me saying some fucked up crazy shit. 

I, newly postpartum/tired of the drama/pretty sure the story wasn’t adding up, WRONGLY (don’t come for me Reddit) asked my husband to block her for just a few days. Eric does and then a few days later when he thinks she’s calmed down he unblocks her. They try to have a conversation, it doesn’t end well, and Katie blocks my husband. 

We expected to have her unblock us at some point and we just waited but she never did. Eric tried many times to get in contact but nothing. 
We kept living our life, had our twins boy and girl, October 2023. We thought we’d hear from her around then but we didn’t. 

My husband spent a good chunk of time last year trying to find her/find the child. We DID end up going to south east Asia earlier this year to celebrate 5 years of marriage. We were there, with our kids, for 3 weeks and traveled all over. Eric tried multiple times to reach out and we hear nothing. 

Over this weekend, we get unblocked by Katie, and she starts off by apologizing and admitting she knows what she did was wrong. And the moment my husband read that out loud I knew where it was going. Sure enough she cops to the fact she has major mental health issues and lied about the whole thing. She was never pregnant. She enjoyed their time together during their study abroad and didn’t want to lose him and thought she could baby trap him. In her message she spoke about how when she told him about the baby, she thought he’d get on a flight back and be with her. When he made it “clear” he was “more focused on partying” than being a mom that’s when she blocked him the first time. She met someone else, we’ll call him J, and then when J broke up with Katie, that’s when Katie reached back out and said she had the baby. But she never did. She never was even pregnant. It was all a ruse. 

J, was always the man we THOUGHT she was with. Turns out they broke up years and years ago and she’s been lying to us about J. 

I don’t know what to do. 
This is such a HUGE lie/cover up. 
I am concerned for my safety. I spent this morning deactivating mine and Eric’s social media accounts. 
I feel as if she has been watching all of us for a long time and I don’t even know what to do. 

My husband doesn’t want our friends and family knowing just yet, which I am fine with but I don’t even know how to begin with that. 

If anyone has had a situation that matches this level of fucked up, obviously fake children in other countries is a niche problem, but this level of fucked up shit happens often. I need to know where to start. Where we go. What I do. What I can say. Any advice. 

TLDR : my husband met a crazy lady during his study abroad. She told him that she was pregnant and never was. For the last 12 years she’s popped in and out of his life talking about a child that never existed. This weekend she admitted it was all a lie.

1jl96r5,relationship_advice,"My (26F) bf (28M) hates that I have a permanent bracelet with my two best friends, but I don’t see the issue. Does anyone have any advice on the situation?","Update: we talked about it more today and I got more insight on why he doesn’t like it. He said it isn’t classy and is equivalent to having a tattoo in his pov. He said it cheapens an engagement ring since I already am wearing something that connects me to somebody else. He said it’s childish and immature and that if we were married he wouldn’t want me to wear that and my ring. It would have to be only my ring. (The bracelet was on the right hand fyi.) he said he would understand if I bought myself the bracelet, but he doesn’t get that it’s something two other people also have. He said he didn’t choose to date them, so why would I want to be like them. He sees the body as very sacred and really considers everything he puts on it and would want me to see it the same way. I honestly think he’s reaching. Not sure where we go from here but the implications about why he doesn’t like it feel bigger than what I was originally thinking. 

I got a permanent bracelet with my two high school best friends a couple of years ago when we all were in the same city. (We all live in different cities now as adults so we have reunion trips every year or so.) I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years now. My boyfriend made his dislike for the idea clear then, but I didn’t think too much of it since I was excited and thought the idea was cute. He hadn’t said much about it for a while, but I recently made a comment that it had stretched out too much to the point I could slip it out so I had to go get it resized. He said “or just take it off and never put it back on.” I thought he was joking but he proceeded to go off about how weird it was that I wear it and how I give my friends too much weight by doing that and that I never wear anything he gives me every day. I told him I do wear the things he gives me, but this is the only piece I have that I don’t ever take off because it’s “permanent” so I can shower with it and sleep with it without ruining it or losing it. I always lose jewelry so I tend to wear pieces I care about less frequently so they don’t get lost and cheaper/ pieces I don’t care about as much more in case I do lose them. I said if he got me something I could sleep and shower in, I would wear it every day. He said it only makes sense to have something on my body every day that is related to my family or him. He said if the roles were reversed, I would also hate it, but that’s really not true. I don’t think it’s that big of a deal, it’s not like a tattoo or something actually permanent. I took the bracelet off for now, but I do really like having it. Does anyone have advice on how to handle this situation? Is it weird to have this bracelet with my friends? I felt really sure that it isn’t weird and shouldn’t be an issue, but the more I think about it, the more I’m questioning it. Any insight is appreciated! 

Edit for context: the friends are girls! He doesn’t mind one of them, but he actively dislikes the other one because of some of her “lifestyle choices” (nothing detrimental, he just doesn’t agree or support, but that’s a whole different convo) 

Edit again: the lifestyle choice is that she likes to drink and go out to bars! Nothing about racism or sexuality! 

Another edit to add context: it’s a thin gold chain that usually sits right on my wrist. no charms or embellishments. ",2467,0.96,2467,0,2574.0,107.0,767,1743095805.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jl96r5/my_26f_bf_28m_hates_that_i_have_a_permanent/,False,True
1ksrxhk,relationship_advice,I (30F) lashed out at my (31M) boyfriend after he violated a boundary during sex. Was my reaction too excessive?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Overall, our relationship has been good. We both have a history of emotionally abusive relationships where we were the ones being abused. We’ve talked in depth about our past, our boundaries, and our desires to not repeat those same patterns again. Neither of us are perfect but we try our best to mitigate reactions that are rooted in past pain. We often talk of having children, but we’re not financially ready for one yet. He is the kind of guy that wants to have children and would make things work if we have a child sooner than expected. I am hesitant to have children too soon because I’m still in the process of healing from my past and learning to re-regulate my nervous system. He knows this. 

I’m not on birth control, so I asked him to use a condom every time we have sex. But he has a tendency to “get his dick wet,” first without it. And each time I remind him to put on the condom, I’m not taking any chances. 2 days ago while we were having sex, I asked him to put on the condom like I always do. But he kept going. I repeatedly mentioned the condom then he started lightly shushing me. I lay there in shock because he had never done this before. Eventually he pulls out and releases his load on my stomach. He knows I don’t like the pullout method without my consent. 

A lot of my triggers came to the surface as felt a boundary was crossed after he ignored me. A little later that morning I asked to talk about it, which he knew was coming. But I ended up lashing out on him- telling him how I felt violated, disrespected and taken advantage of. I reminded him of how he has done similar things in the past and how I’ve asked him not to do it anymore. I was so angry that I told him it was taking a lot for me to not hit him. I never touched him, just expressed everything I was feeling in that moment. He was quiet and didn’t respond, so I went to my computer to cool down.

When we finally had a real conversation, I was calmer and asked him why he did it. He said he wasn’t thinking and was just excited to have sex. After some more talking, he recognized what he did wrong and apologized to me. But then he flipped the conversation on me and said my reaction was hostile and exhibited signs of abuse because I said I wanted to hit him in that moment. Essentially saying my reaction was excessive. He didn’t like me speaking to him so angrily. It was the first time I had ever reacted that way and I felt I needed to defend myself, something I’ve always struggled with in the past. I’m not sorry for defending myself, but I can see how my reaction might’ve been too much from his perspective, considering his actions was with ill intent. We have decided not to have sex for a while.

I’m now questioning myself and our relationship. Was my reaction to excessive? 

[UPDATE]

Thank you all for the validation and encouragement. This has all been extremely painful to process and frankly I’ve been dissociating since I posted this. I never thought it would ever get this much attention. I don’t know any of you but you’re giving me the strength I need to get through this.

I want to leave but it will take some time. I’m not in the financial position to just leave. And I don’t have anyone that can take me in right now. To make matters more complicated his son (my boyfriend is divorced) will be visiting us for the summer. He’s a preteen and I’m hesitant to escalate things while a child is here. 

I’m planning to ask him to leave when his son goes back home. This apartment is the only place I can afford right now. If any of you have other suggestions please tell me. 

Regarding the birth control:

I took plan B the day he assaulted me. I was previously on an IUD. I had it removed because I experienced some kind of hormonal crash. It made me extremely emotional, anxious, and unable to do normal everyday things. Though he did his best to talk me into removing it many times before…the crash just happened to worked in is favor. I can confirm him “getting his dick wet,” was coerced overtime when we transitioned to condoms.

To those of you asking how I could anyone end up in this position, here is some backstory:

I’ve always been empathetic to a fault. I grew up within a family of narcissists and other undiagnosed personality disorders, domestic abuse, and a lineage of women who have been physically abused and/or raped. Part of my family exists because of rape. My father was not a part of my life and my mother’s depression made her emotionally absent. All I can remember is feeling like I was bad and there was something wrong with me. I never felt safe and I spent countless hours lying in bed at night fearing if someone I loved was going to die. I numbed myself a lot just to get through the day. And that was all before the age of 16. Doesn’t help that I barely had any close friends. My self, esteem and perception of others has always been fucked. 

I know I deserved better. But after all your comments, I realized I’ve never felt good enough for someone better…I thought I had to be “perfect,” for someone better. Whatever that means. I’ve only had 2 serious boyfriends (including the current one). I was with the first for 10 years. He destroyed any sense of self or confidence I managed to develop up until meeting him. Nothing I did or said ever felt up to his standards. It got so bad I stopped trusting myself completely. When that relationship ended, I met my current boyfriend.

1maf15t,relationship_advice,I (39M) read my wife’s (39F) text messages,"I (39M) read my wife (39F) of 10 year’s text messages with one of her co workers (M) and found this message that happened while they were both attending a work conference out of town.

This coworker is someone I have known and had over to our home for over 7 years. He is married. I have met his wife. We have gone out with them before and had them over to our home and been to theirs. In this time, I have never heard him speak like this to my wife, his wife, or me.

Text messages exactly verbatim: 
Male coworker: I really want you to enjoy yourself and soak up all the good energy-it truly lifts me to see your spirit shine. But if I'm being honest, l'd love to steal a little quiet, intimate time with you. I know it's beautiful the way you share your light with everyone, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to feel like the most important one in the room to you... because that's exactly what you are to me. Is that something you'd be willing to share with me?

Wife: I'm in the breakout meeting and then I'm not planning on attending shit else. So I'm down for whatever after this.

I confronted her about the message and asked her how long they had been having an affair. She acted confused and like she did not know what I was talking about. I had her open her phone and I showed her the message exchange.

She said that nothing happened, and that he just talks that way. I pressed further because the tone of that message is unlike any I’ve ever experienced or seen between people in a normal work relationship. She said that he wanted some time to discuss work problems in private. I told her that this doesn’t involve hotel rooms and this type of “intimate” time he is asking for. I asked her what his wife would say if I shared this message with her. She agreed it would not look good. I also noticed she deletes messages from him regularly. I asked why she did that. She said it’s because the way he talks would not look good so she deletes it in case I go through her phone, but she said nothing has ever happened. I’m talking hundreds of deleted texts. So that makes me feel even more uncomfortable.

She wants us to go to counseling because she says I have trust issues. One of my previous relationships ended with my partner cheating on me… While I agree I may have some deep seated trust issues due to my past, I think this is at a minimum blatant disrespect for me and our marriage if nothing sexual truly happened or worse, she has been cheating on me.

I would like opinions on this situation and advice. I’m happy to answer any questions that doesn’t involve any private info.",2443,0.97,2443,0,2521.0,78.0,1002,1753596764.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1maf15t/i_39m_read_my_wifes_39f_text_messages/,False,True
1hea481,relationship_advice,I (26F) found inappropriate photos of my friends on my (26M) phone in a hidden folder lastnight?,"My boyfriend and I are coming up on 5 years and we live together. First of all I’d like to preface by saying this is the EXACT reason why I broke up with my last boyfriend before my current boyfriend. I went through his phone one night and found a hidden folder of a bunch of my friends photos screenshotted and zoomed in on their chests/asses. Well lastnight I went to set an alarm on my boyfriends phone and my curiosity got the best of me and what do you know I found a hidden folder full of pictures of my friends in bathing suits as well as photos/videos of my friends from my iPad photo gallery of them shaking their asses and a series of inappropriate photos. There was even a photo of my sister on there. 

To say I’m heartbroken would be an understatement. He knew that my ex had done the exact same thing to me and I broke up with him on the spot over it. I am so disgusted, I can’t even look at my friends, I can’t look at my boyfriend it’s actually just flat out disturbing. What’s even more disturbing is that he was doing that while I was in the same apartment as him as a lot of the time stamps are between 1-5am. Most of these photos were saved just a couple weeks ago when we had a couple days of to celebrate his birthday. I actually feel sick to my stomach. How can people be so fucked up. Right before Christmas, I just got back from Christmas shopping for him and his family just yesterday. I actually cannot begin to wrap my head around the fact that this has now happened twice to me. Why is life so hard sometimes, this is one of these moments where I really wish I could just go into a coma until this pain stops. Why do men do this? I can’t even imagine ever looking at his friends in a sexual connotation. It’s just so wrong.

1orgfix,relationship_advice,"My (32F) fiancé (37M) is a homicide detective, and I’m starting to feel like he treats me more like a suspect than a partner.","My fiance and I have been together for almost 4 years. He’s a homicide detective. My friends immediately started side eying me. They said don’t date a cop, it’s not worth it, they’re all abusive, etc. None of them have ever actually dated a cop, so I found their opinions more annoying than anything else. I just felt like they were basing their judgment off a stereotype. My mom said similar things, but she dated a cop who was former military with PTSD like 49 years ago and based everything off that

Lately though, a few things have started to bother me. I don’t know if it’s just that these incidents seem to be more frequent or if I was just willfully blind to it before. I’m just bothered by these things now.

He records our arguments. I’ve known about that for a while. He told me it was “to make sure we remember things correctly and communicate better,” and I believed him at first. I didn’t like it and I thought it was petty and stupid. I asked him if he saved the recordings and he said he deletes them once the argument was resolved. I’ve since found a folder on his computer labeled with dates and times and they’re recordings of arguments or other conversations we’ve had going back over a year!

He notices tiny changes in my behavior and asks questions in a way that feels more like an interrogation than concern. I also recently discovered he’s done background checks on some of my friends and co-workers. 

Sometimes his phone buzzes and he steps out for hours without explanation, but he just says he’s “handling work stuff” whenever I ask. He makes cryptic comments like, “You know I only trust what I can verify,” or “I like to know everything that might matter” when it comes to things between us…not strictly talking about work, then he laughs it off, but the words stick. It’s hard to tell when he’s joking and when he’s serious.

I love him, but it’s like sometimes I feel like he’s treating me like I’m some sort of suspect. He doesn’t seem to trust anyone, including me! Every little disagreement feels like it could be “evidence.” Recently he’s made some comments related to having kids, about having a tracker on them at all times and never letting them spend the night at friend’s houses (this came after I told him that people at work were saying their kids don’t have sleepovers like we used to have). He said he’ll never let his kids spend the night at somebody else’s house and that he’ll do background checks on every parent of our kids’ friends and teachers. I feel like these sort of comments are becoming more frequent and it’s just escalating. 

How do I handle this with him? How do I discuss this in a way that won’t just turn into a dumb argument that he inevitably records for no good reason? I honestly don’t know how to bring this up to him. I’ve considered telling him he needs therapy because he cannot continue to live life so suspicious and paranoid about everything and everyone. I’m pretty sure he’ll refuse that.

1or8o7f,relationship_advice,My 25F husband’s 26M best friend 26M ghosted him while saying final goodbyes as Hurricane Melissa neared while we were in Jamaica. Now he’s grieving. What can I do for him?,"It was a disaster. We went for our honeymoon and to visit family. We couldn’t get a flight out soon enough or transportation and had to stay through the storm. It’s haunted me every night since. I can’t stop thinking about how it felt to watch the news tell us we need to get our affairs in order, or how it felt to hear the roof ripping away in chunks and the trees get undressed and tossed aside in the wind as it beat against our doors. We were so so fortunate to survive.

As it got closer, we called our friends to say our goodbyes. (Added - no it wasn’t a ridiculous call. We called them to say we love them and we will lose connection soon. It was goodbye to us. We did* arrange for our mother to have all of our belongings and donate them after we pass. We just wanted to hear the voices of our friends again). While my friends, who are by extension his friends too - they love him, all answered and did their best to help us and were optimistic and loving to both of us, his friends were not so much. 

His best friend in particular took the opportunity to tell my husband it was his fault (it was my fault we were there) and to get real and check the weather next time. Added: he didn’t answer the call, this was over text. 

We knew the season. We knew the risk. IT WAS NOT CAT 5 HURRICANE RISK. There’s no need for rewriting history. Storms so powerful aren’t so usual this late, but we bought travel insurance. We tried to leave. Everything that could go wrong did and we were so lucky to survive. We left with a phone full of new contacts and a suitcase with nothing but our cheap souvenirs the clothes we were going to wear to the airport. Everything else went rightfully to the staff who stayed to take care of us.

I won’t and don’t feel like we should defend our choice to go. It gave us the chance to help a lot of people and to be seriously humbled. However, since that night, my husband continues to grieve his friendship. I can’t imagine how he feels, but I do know that he cries late into the night. He’s stopped playing games like he used to because he played with them. 

I just want to help him, but I don’t want to get in the way. Any husbands, boyfriends, cleverer partners of any arrangement have any advice? I lost my friends when we dated because I changed my lifestyle completely and don’t regret it. That was my choice and it still stung. I can’t imagine how this feels remotely. He’s my best friend and he’s an amazing amazing man. He deserves the whole stinking world. What do you think you’d do? What would you like done for you?


Update - we are playing resident evil 5 now over a bowl of his favourite soup. I want to thank all of you for your replies, and any comments that come, I am preemptively grateful. Please don’t waste time talking about the hurricane, what wasn’t the point, though it seems to be evidence that there are many people like my husband’s friend roaming the internet. Good luck to you. How horribly awful it is to have to default on disgust and anger. 

Thank you ALL, and I mean all, for your comments. I’m going to continue to watch for any other advice as it comes. I’m grateful for it all, even if I kind of suck sometimes. I apologize for that. Don’t hesitate to call it out. I could use some humbling. If you’d like the timeline on our attempt to flee Melissa, there is a small thread about it. Please do read it so that it is fully obvious how defenseless many tourists were during the storm. With all my gratitude, goodnight. 

Update Again - what the heck? I’m really so sorry for causing any uproar. A lot of people are in my DMs on instagram because I was an idiot with a similar username telling us we should have died. 1. THERE WAS NO WARNING BEFORE WE LEFT. 2. We tried to leave and prioritized other couples with advanced needs like wheelchairs or limited mobility who we helped leave before the hurricane struck. 3. We WERE privileged to be at our resort. We went to visit our family in Clarendon. We offered our room and whatever we had because we didn’t have much because we PLANNED TO SPEND OUR DAYS WITH FAMILY THERE IN JAMAICA. Anyone who spurs this on should be absolutely ashamed. 


The very day after, the roads were gone and we couldn’t do anything. We stayed to provide medical and provisional aid, and helped other families reconnect. My family is from Jamaica. Respectfully, SHOVE OFF. People telling me I’m a criminal for using our honeymoon to visit my  family? YOU STINK. I HOPE otherwise but KNOW you aren’t doing anything to help the people of the Caribbean. GO AWAY. You stink and you are awful. I changed my handles. YOU ARE MEAN PEOPLE. I hope you’re embarrassed. You should be. You’ve proven how freaking ugly and untrustworthy people can be. LEAVE ME ALONE. 

Everyone else - thank you. Constructive criticism is so valuable. I have so much to do better and have a huge learning opportunity in so many ways. I can’t wait to play with some of you. I know DMs are not typical here, but we are HAPPILY collecting friends on steam. Thank you so so much.

Since then he has tried maybe 2 or 3 odd jobs. None of them very well paying or lasting more than a couple weeks. He has contributed less than.. maybe 2000 to our family this year. 

We have two 2 year-olds together. I've made about all the sacrifices I could to keep us afloat. Went into CC debt. Worked two jobs at times. I make about 53k a year and work extra odd shifts for OT. But yeah, I gave up having an apartment this past summer because of debt accumulating.

Recently, my parents offered to watch the kids more full time so I don't have to pay for daycare, which would allow me to afford to support the 3 of us somewhat decently and get an apartment. 

I told him that if he can't get a job, like anything I'll even take 10/hrs just something to help me, that he can't come with us. I can't support him too. He has no disabilities that would prevent him from working. 

I know it is a tough market. I know that. But we are coming up on a year and I just can't stomach him being at our apartment doing nothing, while our kids are taken care of so we can work. In any way possible. 

So if he can't do this, is it fair for me to say he can't come with us? 

Edit: About why I was paying for daycare - 

To clarify - i had my kids in a 2 day educational program. It was hard to afford but I was doing this for their benefit. They are smart and deserved hands on and the social aspect. My mom has offered to take this over for us until I am more financially secure. So not daycare, more like a school curriculum

I switched from a WFH position earlier this year for more pay. Up until that point i was the kids primary care, and working, and finishing a degree... it has been a crazy year of transition. I'm just tired and confused and I just want stability for myself and my children.

I've grappled a lot for what is best for my kids. I'm new to the whole school/daycare thing, trying to do the best by the kids.

He is a good dad. He loves them. He is failing me as an equal partner though. ",2411,0.94,2411,0,2575.0,164.0,294,1761332095.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1of65y0/is_it_fair_or_me_27f_to_tell_my_husband_34m_that/,False,True
1lt6ifx,relationship_advice,I (F30) want to apologize to the woman (F36) whose husband (M40) I slept with,"When I was 19, I worked a part time job while in college. I was working with my manager one night and it was really slow. We went the last 3 hours before closing just talking. I didn’t take any of it as flirting, I knew he was married, and he was 10 years older, I didn’t think anything of it. 

Shortly after this, he texted me while I was in class. It was normal conversation until he said “you’re so adorable”. I didn’t shut him down, and we continued texting the whole night. 

Things from there escalated pretty quickly. We talked all the time. He would call me, he’d come see me at work, and eventually we even started hanging out. 

One day after walking me to my car after a closing shift, he kissed me. We text each other every night, very late into the night. That night, he asked me to come to his place as soon as she left work around 7am. So I would go to his house, then go to class. This became almost an every day thing. 

He knew I was very inexperienced (I had only been with my ex boyfriend). He said he had no issues going slow and started me his girlfriend.  However, he made a “rules”, no pants when we’d be snuggling. Which quickly turned into us sleeping together. This went on for about 6 months. We said I love you, everything. He became almost controlling, where he’d be mad if I was “too friendly” with other guys. 

His wife found out about him calling me and he had to stop calling me cell. He would always call me at the store when I was working, and would come by frequently. We stopped hanging out. 

He ended up leaving the store but would still call. They gradually slowed down, I never asked for an explanation, I was confused because he said all these things to me that were obviously not true. 

Then he called the store and was unhappy I was with a new guy. He said he didn’t want to see me in love with someone else, and blocked me on social media. 

We haven’t talked in almost 10 years. I am married to the guy he was angry about. We have a baby. 

I’ve sat on this a very long time and feel awful about it all. I want to apologize to his wife. I know it doesnt change anything but I know I’ve caused her pain. 

Is this something worth doing?

Edit: I hear you all loud and clear - I will not be reaching out!

Edit 2: y’all come up with some crazy scenarios. People grow and change in 10 years. Yes, I know what I was doing was wrong, but was being told things from this man. I have known and sat on it being wrong for years. Trust me, I am very happy. My husband knows and supports whatever I decide to do. Yall writing some of these things, are truly insane.

1mn398m,relationship_advice,Fiancé (34m) is allergic to cats but proposed to me (33F) knowing I have 4 cats and is now saying he had hoped I’d rehome them. What do we do now that we are facing living together?,"So, as the title states. Looking for some help here. My fiancé proposed in April of this year after about 1 year together. During this time we have lived in separate homes.

I have lived in a rental for the past 8 years and he recently bought a fixer upper home. I have had 4 cats for the past 13 years. I didn’t necessarily willingly choose to have four cats, but long story short, I ended up with a mom and her three kittens and have raised them for the last 13 years, and anyone that knows me knows my cats have become my trusted companions. 

Over the past year and half together my fiancé will stay at my house. He has never had a bad reaction with the exception of one time we were sitting on the floor doing a craft and he got watery and itchy eyes. 

So anyway, onto now. We had decided after the engagement to fix up his home and live there since he owns the home. I have been helping remodel the house. I was very anxious about leaving my safe space at first but fiancé kept telling me to think of the positive things such as my cats get to lay in the bay window etc etc etc. 

So now during renovations he had an electrician come and the electrician left drywall dust in his wake that my fiancé had a bad reaction to. My fiancé then started saying that he was unsure he could live with cats and this whole situation has now completely spiraled. I said I was comfortable making accommodations such as a cat free bedroom, air purifiers, frequent vacuuming (it will be hardwood floors and he has a roomba). But he is still nervous and unsure. He told me he spoke to someone before proposing and this someone told him that I should choose him over the cats and that it hurts that I am not. 

I am just sort of baffled at all of this. He knew I had the cats, he proposed, suggested moving in, etc etc. I can’t help but feel like the rug is being pulled out from under me. I don’t know what to do at this point. I am certainly willing to take his health into consideration- does this mean living separately? (That would be unfortunate but perhaps doable), getting a separate living space such as a cat house for the back of his house for them?) I don’t know, but I’m just looking to see what other people think. Am I being inconsiderate for not agreeing to rehome them?

1o0yswm,relationship_advice,"My (18F) boyfriend(24M) is upset I denied intimacy because he was crusty, how do I remedy ?","I just moved out of my disgusting childhood home. Mold, trash, bugs, smells. All of it. In my new home I am keeping it as clean as possible, and avoiding polyester because the texture disgusts me and was all I ever knew as a child. 

I worked my butt off to afford silk sheets and high quality bedding. I take really good care of my cleanliness and I am probably paranoid at this point. 

Tonight I invited my boyfriend to hangout, cuddle, and watch a movie. I told him I was gonna take a shower and wear comfy PJs, and I was excited to rest! 
My boyfriend is not necessarily gross, but today when he arrived I was just a bit uncomfortable. He was wearing dirty jeans and his hair was so greasy it looked like he had used gel. He works in an office and isn’t active whatsoever so I didn’t really understand what was up. He apologized for looking a mess and said he was excited to see me.

I just couldn’t handle it, his shirt was scratchy, and he had JEANS on. So I brought him into the living room and put on a movie. He immediately started getting physical and kept pulling me into long kisses. I didn’t entertain making out because I knew it would turn into sex, and then we’d end up going to my bed.

Finally after awhile he asked why I wasn’t interested in him at all, and I told him exactly what I am telling you all now. 
He got upset, moped around for a bit, and left.

Now I just feel like a neat freak asshole. How can I remedy the situation?

1ll06vh,relationship_advice,UPDATE: I (38M) found out my wife (36F) cheated in the beginning of our relationship,"[If anyone wants to see the original post, it's here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lja8vb/i_38m_found_out_my_wife_36f_cheated_in_the/)

&gt;TL;DR: I found out my wife cheated in the beginning of our relationship because she was not sure if things with me were going to work out with me. I overheard her saying this to her sister. Said she regretted it, after seeing a future with me, and nothing of the kind happened again. Should just try and forget what I heard?

I received a lot of good feedback on my other post. As usual, there's the *""DIVORCE NOW""* crew on Reddit, but among those, I was actually surprised to see good suggestions.

Anyway, after I made the post, I talked to my therapist. She helped me put things in perspective, and made me really think on what and how I value my relationship with my wife. She made me realize that I really needed to have this conversation with my wife, but not about the cheating itself, but about how she hid it from me.

Last night, I decided to speak with my wife. I waited until we were both chilling, and called her to our bedroom, saying I needed to talk.

She tensed up and went with me, asked me what was wrong. We both sat on our bed, and I had to hold myself together not to break down in front of her.

I said I heard when she spoke to her sister about the time she cheated when we started our relationship (yes, when we started being exclusive). I said I was hurt, a lot, but even more due to the fact that she hid it from me. I asked her why she did it, and why she never told me anything.

She broke down crying in front of me. She said it was true, it happened right after we became exclusive.

She said that us being friends at the time, and even having a *friends with benefits* phase made her fall in love with me pretty fast. At the time, she had some friends that kept encouraging her to stay away from me, because she was getting too much attached, and too fast, and she needed to wait and *have more fun* before going all in into another relationship.

When I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said she REALLY wanted to be together with me, so she said yes. But her being a (her words) *naive idiot* at the time, she let herself get influenced by those friends, and in one of those night outs, she got drunk and ended ~~hooking up~~ making out with the guy that work with her in the lab.

She said it was just a ~~hookup~~ make out and nothing sexual happened, and she swore she exaggerated the story to her sister, but they did not have sex. She said she regretted it immediately, and left the party for her home and cried all night.

I said it was irrelevant if they had sex or not, it was the fact that she kept this hidden from me that hurts the most.

She cried again, and said it was wrong of her, it was a stupid mistake she just wanted to pretend it never happened. Said she was afraid I was going to leave her for something so stupid and did not have the courage to tell me.

She swore she loved me, and never felt anything for anyone else after we got together. Then she begged for me to forgive her, again saying it was a stupid mistake of a young and naive girl who has gotten out of a bad relationship and let herself be influenced by bad friends.

I felt she was honest, and I mean it. I believe every word of her, and I feel she genuinely regrets what has happened.

I said I forgive her, but I wouldn't be able to celebrate the date of our *start* again. So we decided to pick another date, we now celebrate our marriage anniversary, and the date we moved in together.

She deflated like a balloon after we spoke, she said it was tormenting her to keep this secret, and she

I'm not gonna lie and say this situation did not leave a mark on our relationship, it did, things definitely shifted, but not in a *""we need to end""* kind of way. But talking to her really did me good, and I love her more than anything in my life.

Even though it hurt me, I am now certain we will both be able to navigate this together.

  
EDIT: people are getting crazy over my bad English again. Apparently ""hook up"" means having sex, and I didn't know that. I meant ""make out"".

1lbd6ig,AmItheAsshole,AITA for enforcing basic boundaries on my daughter's sleepover?,"I 42M, have two kids living with me, my daughter Anya (17F) and my stepson Noah (14M). Noah’s mom passed a few years ago, and I’ve had full custody since. He’s had a rough go of it, but he’s a good kid, with his quirks. He’s not antisocial or shy, but he does not appreciate having his space invaded and when very upset, he can kinda 'shut down'. 

Anya is much more outgoing and has a lot of friends- she asked to have a sleepover this weekend with four of them. I said yes, of course, but given that the friends who were coming were pretty loud and have a tendency to crowd Noah, I told her to make sure they don't go into her brother's room. Also to keep things down after 11, so that the house can sleep. 

In my opinion, these are not strict rules.

To my surprise, I came upstairs to check on them at about 10- they are 17, I didn't think I needed to check on them every hour or something- and they were in Noah’s room. And they looked like they'd been there a while, two were literally sitting on his bed, with him there, one of them was flipping through his sketchbook, another was messing with his other stuff, and they were all kind of giggling in this weird way.

Noah was clearly upset, he didn't say anything/move, but there were tears in his eyes and he didn't respond when I tried to talk to him. I told the girls to get out right then, and that I was calling every single one of their parents. Anya was pretty upset with me, but I told her that I gave them TWO rules and they failed spectacularly. 

I did actually call all of their parents, and sent them home as soon as possible. Anya blew up, saying I embarrassed her. I told her to go to her room, and that we would speak on this in the morning. I spent about 20 minutes with Noah, before he decided he wanted to cool down on his own, and I went back to my daughter- who chose not to speak to me.

Last night, I was seated first and had a glass of wine.

I went up to get food and on return the wine had disappeared, a waiter came over and asked to see my wrist band (for the all inclusive) and said the family had told them I was underage and must have sneaked away from my parents , he was very apologetic and returned with a fresh glass of wine just as the family came back with their food.

1m84q9j,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not waking up a tourist who overslept and missed the day trip she paid for?,"Hi guys! I’m (21f) a Bulgarian tour guide who accompanies groups to Sicily. On a recent trip, one woman who was travelling alone (mid-30s) was consistently oversleeping. 

The first day after we arrived, we had a day trip to Etna and Taormina, for which we depart at at 8 am, as we do all other day tours. I make sure that all tourists are informed of the departure times on the bus the day before and they also have my number to call in case they forget so I can remind them. They also all have printed out pamphlets with the schedule made by the travel agency that I hand out that has the time for departure on it. 

All of the group was on time, except one woman. She was late by 10 minutes, which, okay, maybe she got caught up in something and was late. I excused it, then mentioned to the whole bus in the mic that I do not tolerate lateness beyond 15 minutes at most in case of emergency like a forgotten possession, and that I must ALWAYS be called and informed in case someone is running late. Trip went by okay otherwise. 

The next day this same tourist was late again, by TWENTY FIVE minutes. Almost an entire half hour. I called her twice to no answer and we were just about to leave without her when she came out running and got on the bus (she got lucky, as the receptionist of the hotel asked me about a missing piece of info on the rooming list and earned her some time). I reminded everyone AGAIN that I will not be waiting anymore for late tourists in the morning, and waking up on time is their responsibility. 

When we came back that evening, she asked me if I could 'make sure to wake her up on time'. I reminded her a THIRD time that I’m not responsible for waking people up. Everyone gets a printed itinerary with departure times, and I announce everything the day before. She kept saying, ""No, no, just knock on my door if I’m not out by 8:15"" and I kept repeating ""I really can’t do that for everyone, please set an alarm.""

Well, on the day we were visiting Syracuse, she didn’t show up. I waited 15 minutes after the supposed departure time, called her twice to no response, then left with the bus and the rest of the group. She called me in a panic about an hour later asking where we were. I explained the situation calmly. She got angry and said that I had one job and that I cheated her out of the money she paid to go on that day trip.

She missed the whole day trip and was furious the next day. Later she told the rest of the group that I abandoned her and also called my agency, leaving a bad review about me.

My sister is pregnant and wanted me to make the cake for her gender reveal. Cool, no problem. I asked her to send me the info so I could prep the inside-classic pink or blue filling.

I was like... huh? So you want a gender reveal cake with no gender revealed...? She says she'll have someone email the info to me later.

That someone never did.

Deadline comes, and I still have no gender. So I make the cake. It's grey inside. Grey outside. Just full on cement vibes. I even added little fondant clouds for effect. It still tasted great, but visually? Grim as hell.

The reveal day comes, they cut into it, and my sister looks pissed. Her husband is confused. People start murmuring. Then she pulls me aside like, ""Why would you make it grey? That's so passive-aggressive.""

calmly reminded her that no one told me the gender. I literally had no data to work with. I told her I wasn't about to guess or go full improv on someone's baby cake.

Now my mom says I embarrassed her in front of the family and that I ""should've tried harder."" Tried harder to do what, summon the gender through vibes?

So... AlTA for making the most neutral reveal cake in history?

SIL and her husband had a baby 2 years ago.  No major complaints - they just tend to ask for people to do stuff that I would think they'd do themselves.  

* They'll come over our house (they live an hour away) and they'll ask ahead of time if we have their kid's favorite crackers on hand.  Why they don't just pack the crackers, I don't know (they are well off, money not an issue). 
* If one of them leaves the room, they'll ask one of us (my wife or kids) to be ""in charge"" of the baby - even if the other parent is right there, just scrolling on their phone or something.

 But whenever I say something to my wife, she says I'm being too much.

The other day, we're having a dinner at MIL's house when the baby had a poopy diaper.  SIL looks at me and say in the sweetest voice ""Uncle (my name), can you change the diaper?"" (she frequently does this when we're there but this was the first time I was asked)

""No, I don't do other people's kid's diapers if their mom or dad is around.  I mean if I'm babysitting, sure thing, but yea - if the parents are around - I just feel like its their job.""

SIL looks like she's ready to cry ""Well...I feel selfish.""

I smiled to try and set her at ease, ""Not trying to make you feel any way, just telling you a boundary is all.""

The table got really awkward as she got up and did the diaper.  Afterwards my wife blamed me for making SIL feel bad and said I could've just changed the diaper.  

Not trying to make anyone feel bad - but I've had 3 kids and I always took responsibility  -I watched them, I packed for them, and I changed them.  I'm not looking to be a secondary parent for this kid.

1hda8ay,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not telling a man that the research he was mansplaining to me was my own? ,"I don't normally post on reddit so please forgive me if I do this wrong. 

I (33f) work in a very small, technical, specific, male dominated field. I won't give too much information on it as I think you could easily find my identity if I did, but let's just say it's a sub category of law. 

I graduated 9 years ago (for anyone wondering, the system in my country is different than in the US so I only studied for 5 years), and am now a lawyer as well as a researcher. I published some work here and there but nothing too major, and no one outside of that field knows my work. 

Yesterday I went to a bar with a couple of friends who introduced me to one of their friends who works in the same field as me. I was pretty excited to meet him because it's rare to meet people who work in that field. He doesn't exactly do the same thing as I do, he's not a lawyer but a legal advisor, but we work on the same topics. So naturally we started talking about our work. 

At one point we were discussing a point on which we had different opinions, so I explained mine to him and he replied by saying that my opinion was based on nothing while his was based on the work of a professional (you guessed it, me). He basically started explaining my work to me, but in a completely wrong way and missed all of my points. I asked him if he was sure that that was what the author meant and he said that he was because it was ""pretty simple actually"". For another good 20 minutes he explained all of it to me in details, like I was a first year law student. I didn't say anything because it was pretty funny to watch him say things that were completely wrong with so much confidence. 

After that the topic changed and the night went on, but at the end of the night right before leaving I decided to tell him that I was actually the person that wrote the work he had quoted, and that he hadn't really understood it. He reacted very badly and got angry, and he told me that I had manipulated him to humiliate him. He yelled at me for not saying it was my work at the beginning. I simply replied that he had embarrassed himself and left. 

I woke up this morning to texts from my friends saying I was wrong for causing drama and tension and that I could've been nicer to their friend. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong there. I mean yes, I could've told him right away, but is it that big of a deal that I didn't? I'm not exactly sure. AITA? 

Edit: I forgot to make this clear and maybe it's a bit of a misunderstanding, but both conversations happened only between the two of us. We were the only ones talking about our work and our friends also weren't really there when I told him that I was the author. So it's not like I publicly humiliated him. The only thing ""embarrassing"" for him here is that a woman seemed smarter than him, and I think that's what ge had an issue with.

Edit 2: I've seen some comments claiming that this post was fake because ""that just doesn't happen"", ""i've seen many other stories where the same thing happens"", ""that's not realistic"". I'm not trying to justify anything because I don't really care, but I just find it funny to see lots of comments from women sharing similar stories and then lots of comments from men saying it doesn't happen.

1ljvbdx,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my friend she’s in the same league as men she calls ugly?,"My friend [19f] downloaded dating apps like Tinder and Hinge for the first
time about a week ago. For reference, she's the type that always says she wants a boyfriend, wants to do couple things, feels lonely single, etc. She's also, imo at least, very normal and average looks wise: not ugly, not super hot, just alright. 

Since then, she's been complaining to me that almost all the men there are ugly, short, etc, and that she doesn't match with anybody hot. 

I asked to see which people she was calling ugly and so she showed me her likes, and it mostly showed people perfectly in her league, as in moderately attractive guys. I told her that these guys were all in her league and she should give some of them a chance since she always complains about wanting to be in a relationship. 

She denied that she's the same league as them and said that she's much more attractive than them. I pointed out that in her own words, she doesn't match with any of the guys she does find attractive, so she's not in their league. 

She said I was an AH. Am I? ",23505,0.9,23505,0,26443.0,2938.0,3519,1750822110.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ljvbdx/aita_for_telling_my_friend_shes_in_the_same/,False,True
1i19x0h,AmItheAsshole,AITA for declining to “fix” the errors I made in a blanket I crocheted for someone and taking it back instead?,"I made a blanket for my sister in law Amanda. I was able to give it to her last weekend. She’d asked for it in certain colors. I didn’t have any other projects on my to do list so I was happy to make it for her. I had most of the colors already too so it worked out.

When I gave it to her she was excited and she started to look it over, I figured it was to see how it was put together, since she doesn’t crochet. After a little bit she said that she loved the blanket, BUT she couldn’t help but notice some of the little mistakes I’d made along the way. I asked her what she meant, and she pointed out some things like I’d accidentally done one row of striping instead of three for one section, I’d switched to the wrong color and threw off a “pattern” at some point, etc. 

She handed it back to me and told me that she loves my progress with it and couldn’t wait to see the finished project. I told her that it was finished. She looked down at it and said that it wasn’t done until it was perfect, and I’d made several mistakes that I could easily go back to correct.

I was honestly dumbfounded by this. I hate the way perfectionists try to force their quirk onto others. I made this blanket for her for free out of my own free time because I love her. I told her that. She said she knows and she loves me for it but that she wouldn’t be able to use it because she wouldn’t be able to focus on anything but the mistakes.

I said whatever and took the blanket back and said that if she doesn’t want it, I’ll keep it. She looked surprised and said that she does want it, she just wants my best work and not something half assed. I told her that if she thinks me crocheting A WHOLE FUCKING BLANKET and making minimal errors is half assing it, I’d rather just keep the blanket.

She’s so upset with me and told me I was acting ridiculous and that it wouldn’t take me long to fix it. If you know anything about crochet you know that if I made an error on row 36 of a 1115 row blanket… that’s essentially starting over again. Anyway I come to you all lol AITA?

1k6sag2,AmItheAsshole,AITAH for playing a voice recording to prove to my friend her daughter isn’t nonverbal?,"So I (30f) have a friend (34f) that has a “non-verbal” daughter (3f) let’s call her Allie. I watch her 4 days out of the week in my in-home daycare.

 **I require contracts for every child and she never filled out the special needs section. And at no point when she asked me to take Allie did she mention any type of speech delay or non speaking issue..** 

Although Allie didn’t speak much at first (I figured she was shy) she communicated her needs to me very well and said small things to me frequently. Last month I was in the bathroom (I keep the door BARELY cracked with a wedge so I can listen for any dangers and they can’t walk in on me or see me) she walked by and said “Ew you stinky”. I laughed and told her mom at pickup what she said and I was met with “SHE ISNT VERBAL WHY WOULD YOU MOCK HER” I reassured her that Allie has spoken to me quite a few times and I thought that it was a huge milestone from when she first arrived and was barely saying anything. She told me she didn’t believe me and that it was messed up that I would make up something like that to upset her. I told her that I wasn’t trying to upset her but I wasn’t lying either. I didn’t press the issue further. 

Here’s where I might be the AH. I decided to record Allie (a voice recording, not her face) telling me her name and what her favorite animal is. 

** I had full intention of showing mom the recording, but I was scared at first because of her blowup at me and I didn’t know how she would react. After a few short pickups and drop offs she told me it was water under the bridge and that she didn’t want to talk about it anymore. She even insisted that I went to the birthday party. After that I was just happy Allie could continue and I ended up forgetting I had the recording at all. 

Fast forward to Friday (about a month later) she had a birthday party for her other child. At the party I was socializing with other family members (Honestly I’m a total dumbass for forgetting that her family fully thought that she was nonverbal) I mentioned the funny things Allie has said to me while we were reading an animal book. Turns out the person I was talking to was her sister and she started yelling at me saying “SHE IS NON-VERBAL WHY ARE YOU LYING”. Both her and her sister start berating me saying that it’s f*cked up that I’m making this up about Allie being verbal. At this point I’m tired of being called a liar. I have two disabled children whom my son was non-verbal for many years. I wouldn’t lie about something like this. So while everybody was staring at me I was scared and felt backed into a corner. So I (remembering I had the recording) decided to prove my case and play the voice recording. Everybody was shocked and my friend told me to leave. I told her I didn’t want to cause issues but I’m not gonna be berated and called a liar. She said that I crossed the line recording her daughter and that I’m an a**hole for embarrassing her at the party. Now I feel horrible and wondering if I should have just let it go..

Edit for clarification and extra context: 

Whenever she would pickup and drop off she wouldn’t ask me much other than “how was her nap, how much did she eat” and I would hand her the daily report then she would leave and not stay for small talk even when I would try to initiate.  
I know people have busy lives so I’m not gonna try to make them stay and talk to me about their life story. 

I also didn’t do the recording to embarrass her in any way. I didn’t mean any vindication by it. I can admit I should have shown her immediately after I recorded it but I’m also human and I was afraid of a second blow up. Then after her saying it was water under the bridge I was just happy that she wasn’t gonna take Allie away so I put it in the back of my mind and forgot about it. 

I feel bad about how I went about my defense (hence the post). I know it was unprofessional and unethical. I apologized profusely to everybody at the party and the family as well. 

I will be putting cameras in my home that everybody will have access to as well as updating all the contracts to let parents know what is going to happen going forward. Peace of mind for everybody sounds good to me! Also, I will be making a call to cps about the situation and see what they have to say.

1nbq3x2,AmItheAsshole,Do you have a butt? Read this.,"Every year, thousands of young people hear the words, “You have colorectal cancer” — cancer of the colon or rectum (parts of your digestive system). It’s terrifying. Colorectal cancer is the deadliest cancer in men under 50 and second in young women. But we’d be the assholes if we didn’t tell you the truth: It doesn’t have to be this way.

Colorectal cancer, or CRC, is one of the most preventable cancers with screening and highly treatable if caught early. So why is it upending the lives of so many young people? In a word: *stigma*.

Nobody likes talking about bowel habits, rectal bleeding, or colonoscopies. So… the conversation doesn’t happen. Too many people don’t know the symptoms. Too many symptoms get dismissed by healthcare providers. And too many diagnoses come late.

Advanced colorectal cancer has a survival rate of just 13%. Science still hasn’t broken the code to cure every case of colorectal cancer. That’s why awareness, better screening access, and providers taking symptoms seriously are just as important as knowing the signs yourself.

Here’s what you need to know:

* CRC rates in under‑50s are rising.
* Many are diagnosed in their 20s–40s — often after misdiagnoses.
* A close family member with CRC doubles your risk.
* Lynch syndrome or FAP = even higher risk.
* Screening saves lives, and most people have testing options (including at-home tests). 

So why are *we* talking about this? r/AmItheAsshole is approaching 25 million members. To celebrate, we, the mods, have partnered with the Colorectal Cancer Alliance, a national nonprofit leading the mission to end this disease.

Here’s how you can help:

**1. Learn the symptoms.**

Bleeding, persistent changes in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss, abdominal pain. Don’t ignore them. Advocate for yourself. 

**2. Get checked starting at 45.** 

If you’re average risk, you should start getting checked for CRC at age 45. Some people need to get checked earlier. The Alliance’s [screening quiz](https://colorectalcancer.org/screening-quiz) can provide you with a recommendation. 

**3. Support the mission.**

Your donation funds prevention programs, patient support, and research to end colorectal cancer. Even a small gift could help someone get checked and survive.

[Please donate here and show what 25 million people can do together](https://ccalliance.donorsupport.co/page/AITA)!

If you or someone you love has faced CRC, share your story in the comments. You never know who you might help.",22982,0.94,22982,0,24549.0,1567.0,1067,1757343706.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nbq3x2/do_you_have_a_butt_read_this/,False,True
1lwow5n,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for ""letting"" my sister go thirsty through an entire meal?","My sister does this thing where she'll just say something she wants with the expectation that someone will do it for her. For example, if she wants the AC turned on, instead of asking someone to turn it on for her, she'll keep repeating things like ""Oh, isn't it super warm in here?"", ""Does anyone else feel really hot?"" or ""I heard that today is a super hot day!"" and if someone asks her if she wants the AC on, she'll reply with ""No, no, I'm good! But if *you're* hot then you should turn it on!""   
  
Anyways, last weekend it was my birthday so my family and I went out to celebrate. During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. 

When we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we ""let"" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying ""no"" to the waitress because her family should've ""taken care of her"" (her words, not mine). 

The three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

I’m not rich, but I’m doing okay. Ever since I started working, I’ve been expected to help out my extended family, paying for groceries, covering school fees for cousins, sending money to my mom monthly, etc.

In our culture, it’s seen as a duty, what people call “Black tax.” I understood this growing up. I’ve helped where I could. But lately it’s become too much. My siblings now expect me to cover everything, and my mom doesn’t say no to them. I’m expected to help with bills, car repairs, and now even a wedding contribution for my younger cousin’s wedding.

I finally said, “No more.” I’ve started saving for my own life, therapy, travel, and a deposit for my own apartment. I told my family that I’m not a bank, and they need to start standing on their own feet. I told my mom I will only help with the needs and she cried. My aunt called me “whitewashed.” My brother said I’ve become selfish and forgotten where I came from🤦🏽‍♀️

My son and dil ( Emily) are staying in our home probably for the next month due to water damage in there home. The company is fixing the damage but  the flooring was damaged so it’s not very livable right now.

They have only been here less than a week and I am having an issue. I work nights I come back home around 6:30 am and then go to bed. My husband is usually up so I make him a coffee/ breakfast before I turn in. 

Just something  like to do, more quality time before he heads to work. I asked my son and Emily if they would also like coffee or breakfast before they go to work. 

They said no to food but yes to coffee. That was easy and I just made two extra cups. I asked them to tell me if they want me to change how to make their coffee. I thought they would just tell me, use this cream or if they had a preference on blend.

Emily texted me last night and said she left instructions for the coffee. 

This morning I came home to very detail instructions how to make a complex coffee. It was like a Starbucks drink, she wanted foamed milk on top, different syrups, a specific coffee bean ( ground fresh…) and a difffernt brewing method ( we have a drip coffee machine) most of the stuff was one the counter.

I decided I wasn’t doing that and just made the normal coffee. Emily wasn’t happy and we got into a argument before she went to work

I basically told her I am not a Starbucks barrista and I am not going all that. She told me I shouldn’t have offered in the first place if I wouldn’t make the coffee to her liking. We left on a sour note.

1l38g7r,AmItheAsshole,AITA for locking the office fridge after someone kept stealing my lunch?,"I (34M) work in a small office with about 10 people. We share a communal kitchen, including one fridge. Over the past month, my lunch has been stolen *five times*. Not just random snacks entire homemade meals I bring from home, gone without a trace. It’s not just frustrating, it’s expensive and messes up my day.

I mentioned it a couple of times in the group chat, like “Hey, someone’s been taking my lunches. Please stop.” Everyone either ignored it or sent vague messages like “ugh that sucks” or “some people are the worst,” but no one took responsibility.

So I bought a mini fridge and put it under my desk. Nothing fancy, just enough to hold my meal and a drink. I also put a little lock on it just for extra peace of mind. Since then, no more stolen lunches.

Well, last Friday, one of my coworkers (I'll call her Dana, 29F) confronted me during lunch and said it was “weird and selfish” that I had a personal fridge. She said it made me “look paranoid” and “not part of the team.” I said I was tired of my food being stolen, and this was the only solution that worked. She said I should’ve just brought stuff I wouldn’t care about losing, like snacks or microwave meals, if I was so worried.

A couple of others have now made little comments like, “Don't let him see your lunch he might lock it up,” or “We get it, you're special.” I’m starting to feel like the weirdo in the office just for protecting my stuff.

1jaah29,AmItheAsshole,AITA for sending my little sister a vet bill after she tried to get my horses to breed?,"I (33F) am a Horse Breeder and own ten horses. I have a little sister (19F) who was a surprise baby for my parents, they didn't think they could have more after me so she is quite babied even now. They begged me to take her on to help her get some work and I agreed but made it clear she'd have to work hard and there would be no slacking. 

She has generally been *fine* with it and enjoys being around the horses though I do have to light a fire under her arse at times to get her to keep working. The problem however arose when a local animal rescue asked me to help them, they had a Stallion surrendered to them and they didn't have the capabilities to take care of him, I had room so agreed to take him. I've also arranged a full genetic testing on him to ensure he's alright as it seems like he was gotten through backyard breeders. I've also made an appointment to have him gelded as I don't know enough about him to risk him not being gelded. He has his own paddock and is kept in a separate stable than my own horses just to be safe. I'm slowly socialising him but i'm taking no risks.  

I've been letting my sister sit in on my breeding planning for 2025 and my main stars are going to be Dante and Willow. They've had four successful and healthy foals who are going to go into Dressage. I know they work well together and Willow has had a two year break so she'll be ready to go again this year. The first warning bell I overlooked was that my sister asked about the new Stallion and when i'd be breeding him. I explained he'd not be bred as there was too many unknowns, I don't know his health and I don't have a good enough grasp of his temperament. She protested that he was pretty though, prettier than Dante, and I explained there was more to this than looks. I thought she'd understood and didn't think further on this. 

Yesterday an emergency came up and I had to leave my sister alone for an hour. I told her to she could take an hour break. When I came back I found to my horror she'd put Willow into the Paddock with the new Stallion. I asked her what the fuck she was doing and she told me she just thought they'd work well together and she was doing me a favour. I got Willow out of there but not before the new Stallion bucked and reared quite a bit from stress. I got Willow out of there then set about calming him down. I told my sister to get home and not come back. Shouting at her quite a bit.

I then had a vet come out and check them both fully to ensure they'd not hurt each other. My one relief is Willow isn't in estrus yet. I had the bill sent to my sister at my Parents House. They called me today in a panic asking what the hell this was, when I explained they told me I was being unfair and she didn't understand, that she couldn't pay this and was being cruel and my sister was crying.

1kkhll7,AmItheAsshole,AITA for booking my own Air BnB so I don't have to sleep on a couch for six nights?,"My immediate and extended family have booked a vacation for later in the summer. My aunt who found this place knew the owner and they got a great deal. My aunt initially said there are six bedrooms. 

One room for her and her husband (my uncle)
One room for my parents
One room for my cousin and her husband
One room for my other cousin and his wife and one room for their kids are are both under 10. 

The last bedroom you may wonder.. is where my aunt made an innocent mistake in miscounting. There are only five bedrooms. They told me that my boyfriend and I will have to sleep on a pullout couch. 

I told my parents I would rather not sleep sleep on a couch even if it does pull out. I also don't want to make my boyfriend sleep on the couch with me either for his own privacy. It's in the living room which is in the middle of everything. I would rather not be woken to people starting their day and I would rather not have to change in the bathroom each and every time or even leave all my stuff in the living room as well. I don't want to change in my parents room either because I know I would probably rush so that they can have their own privacy. I don't want to put my luggage in anyone else's room and fill their room with my clutter. Same goes for my boyfriend, I don't want to make him do all that either. 

My family has never had this big of a vacation all together in such a long time. I would love to be involved and what not but I said I would rather not go if I can't have a room to myself OR I'll book my own place nearby and I WILL pay for my part for the main house everyone is in regardless. 

My mom refused both options as I will ""ruin"" the trip if I don't stay under the same roof. If I get my own place to stay it would SOLELY be to sleep. I plan to be with my family at all other times and events. I don't care about the price of only getting an Air BnB just to sleep. I want my privacy. 

Haven't mentioned it to my cousins or anyone else yet that I'm considering getting my own place as close as possible, though. 

AITA?

The other day I responded to a bunch of comments the same thing pretty much but to my surprise got so much traction I did not expect so wanted to quickly update. Thank you for all your opinions and input!

I had booked the VRBO a bit ago. Have not brought it up yet. I don't know if I'm ready to open that yet or if I should wait till we all get there the first night and mention it when I'm headed two min down the road (got a very close VRBO) when I'm headed to bed

Lots of people brought up great points I never thought of so thank you as well

1k92qg7,AmItheAsshole,AITA for making my sick husband clean up his vomit?,"Throwaway. My husband has been dealing with a stomach bug of some kind the last few days . Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, etc. I’ve been taking care of him and the house and kids by myself because of it which is a lot of work with 2 under 5. 


This morning my husband wanted to try eating something so I made him toast as requested. As he was on the couch nibbling on his breakfast I was making our toddlers their breakfast and feeding them when I hear him violently gagging in the other room. He’d been hanging out in the living room during this entire illness so he had a trash can there in case he had to puke or whatever. I called out to him to remember to use it or to go to the bathroom if he thought he was vomit. He didn’t listen and threw up all over the floor and got some on the couch. 


Husband then comes into where I’m feeding our kids and says he’s gonna go to our room so I can clean up his puke. I said absolutely not there was really no reason for him to vomit all over the floor so he needed to take care of it . I had been cleaning it up all weekend already without complaining when he was getting sick by surprise but he has plenty of time to prepare for this and not make a mess. Husband is now all mad at me for not showing him a good bedside manner.So AITA? 


Update: never expected so many comments. Feel very validated. All day my husband kept making snide comments at me about not being a good wife and anyone who cares about their loved one wouldn’t “punish” them when they’re sick. So I showed him your comments and it finally shut him up.


I’ve received many DMs and there’s been lots of comments about hubby possibly getting me and our children sick, don’t worry the rest of us are okay. Husband likely got food poisoning from eating food that had been sitting in his work break room for nearly 24 hours. 


Thanks for all the comments ",20206,0.91,20206,0,22424.0,2218.0,3775,1745756626.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k92qg7/aita_for_making_my_sick_husband_clean_up_his_vomit/,False,True
1lqunle,AmItheAsshole,"AITA, asked the neighbor to move their ‘little farm stand’ because people are stealing from MY garden","**Before anyone says ‘just build a fence’ WE CAN’T AFFORD IT RIGHT NOW. And no, no HOA.**

My neighbor set up one of those pantries/farm stands where people can take items that they grew in their garden, pantry stuff, donated stuff, etc. In theory it’s a great idea and especially in a time when life in America sucks ass and people are struggling to make ends meet (my family included)

The problem: people started coming into MY yard to pick things in MY garden. I’ve put up signs saying not to do it, I installed rabbit fence around the garden, I’ve angled a tarp so you can’t see what’s there from the road. People just hold their kids over the fence to pick tomatoes and beans or jump it.

I ended up getting into an argument with a lady over it. I yelled HEY, STOP. THOSE ARE NOT FOR YOU TO TAKE. She told her kid to move faster and then tried to run away. I caught up to her and asked her what the fuck her problem was and she turned it into how dare I swear in front of her child, why am I so angry, am I really that upset about a couple tomatoes. I said I am upset that you are STEALING from me.

The next day, I approached my neighbor. I asked if I could maybe help move it to the other side of their driveway so it’s next to the other neighbor’s house. They don’t have a garden out front. They said at least not until the end of the season. I asked if they could make larger signs, talk to people, just do SOMETHING..

They were like “can you really not afford to share?” I said that they aren’t taking my zucchini because they’re starving, they’re taking my tomatoes because they WANT them. They said that I’m going to have to learn to live with it for now and we can talk about a solution together that will benefit the whole community after. I said I do not care about a solution that benefits the whole community. I care about a solution that stops people from STEALING FROM ME.

So last night it happened again, man in his 50s. I sprayed his ass with the hose. He started yelling at me and after a minute or so the neighbor came out yelling at me too. People have posted on the neighborhood board to be careful if they come by because I’m an asshole. The neighbor says I’m scaring people away from a community resource. I told him that I’m going to continue until he does something about the fucking thieves who feel entitled to MY GARDEN.

I feel like I’m losing my fucking mind here. Am I the asshole for asking them to move it? Am I the asshole for being PISSED OFF that people are fucking STEALING from me? This is food for my family.

**First off, thanks for the responses. I got some good ones.** I'm happy that so many of you live in places where the cops would do anything about this, but this isn't the reality I'm living. Cops here would not give a shit if I sent them a video of someone picking from my garden. They would laugh in my face. Be thankful if you live in a place where the police are useful.

**It looks like signs are the best option for now.** Going to make signs indicating heavy use of pesticides and repeating that they are stealing food from the mouths of hungry children. I don't know why the signs we already have up aren't enough. Maybe more will help. I'm sure they won't.

**Will also scour Craigslist for free fencing** or similar items. Hopefully that pans out.",19562,0.94,19562,0,20896.0,1334.0,2554,1751561696.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lqunle/aita_asked_the_neighbor_to_move_their_little_farm/,False,True
1lynnsd,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not going to my TWIN'S Wedding???,"I (24M) have an identical twin. We're not close, but I thought we had basic mutual respect. That belief was tested.

I grew up in a traditional Southern town &amp; only began coming out in college, about five years ago. It's been slow, especially with family. But since moving to DC in '23 for school/work, I've felt more comfortable living authentically.

After moving, I met my boyfriend (26M), &amp; we've been together 2yrs. Over time, I've introduced him to friends and family when I felt safe.

Cut to Nov. '24: I was home for the holidays &amp; told my twin &amp; his fianceé about my bf. They seemed happy for me. While staying with them, wedding details arose, &amp; they asked if I'd be bringing a date. I said yes, my bf. My twin had gone to bed, but his fianceé said, ""While there are pros and cons, it's up to you if you want to bring him."" That felt like a green light. My twin constantly deferred to her on decisions, so I didn't think I needed to double-check.

5 months passed, my bf &amp; I had spent $1,300 on travel (flights, hotel, etc.). 3 weeks before the wedding, I mentioned on a call with my brother that we were all set. His tone shifted: ""Oh, is BF actually coming?""

I reminded him of the convo with his fianceé. He said she never gave me permission &amp; accused me of making it up. Then said, ""We can't allow your bf to come. We worry how Dad's side will react.""

I offered to call Dad on the spot. He dodged, saying he'd check with his fianceé (despite just saying it was his decision.) An hour later, no change. I was still invited-ALONE, still expected to buy a groomsman-match suiting (even though I wasn't in the party), &amp; show up smiling.

That's when I snapped. I asked, ""If I didn't invite your fianceé to my wedding, would you still come?"" He couldn't answer &amp; ended the call after some harsh words. 

Trying to make things right, I came out to my dad (which I feared for years) to explain the situation. He was surprisingly indifferent &amp; even said uninviting my bf was extreme. He offered to talk to extended family. I thought I was removing the main obstacle. 

Weeks later, my twin called again. He now claimed our friends would be ""weirded out"" (So the excuse shifted) I said, ""If my bf's not invited, I'm not coming."" He didn't budge.

Here's the kicker: days later, my dad told me the fianceé admitted she did give me permission but changed her mind when she remembered ""who would be there."" She denied this to my twin. Also, one of her bridesmaids is openly gay and brought her gf, but, according to the fianceé, ""she's not part of the family,"" so it's different.

So I didn't go. I'm still wondering if I made the wrong call. My absence was noticed. I got texts asking where I was. My mom had to explain it repeatedly. So instead of avoiding attention, my absence became the story. My relationship with my twin is dead, &amp; some family ties now feel fragile.

Part of me wonders, should I have sucked it up &amp; gone solo, just to preserve bonds that shaped my early life?

So, AITA for skipping the wedding?",19472,0.96,19472,0,20319.0,847.0,1345,1752394710.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lynnsd/aita_for_not_going_to_my_twins_wedding/,False,True
1k2eknu,AmItheAsshole,AITAH for calling my husband a disgrace after he said my miscarriage ruined his birthday?,"TW - loss

I miscarried yesterday afternoon about 12pm. I’ve never had a miscarriage before and this baby was so wished for so it’s all so fresh and I’m sobbing right now so I apologise in advance if it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. My husband turned 27 yesterday.

I 26F *was* pregnant with mine and my husband’s 27M 2nd child. Yesterday, I was 8 weeks pregnant. The day before yesterday we saw a beautiful heart beat flicking on the screen and today I’m devastated. I was playing with our 2 year old when I felt a pressure in my lower abdomen. Not long later, I noticed bleeding and I let my husband know immediately that I had discomfort and bleeding. Before long I had passed what I believe is the fetus and I messaged him “I think I lost the baby”. I wanted to keep him updated and I guess I was seeking some kind of emotional support. I asked if he could come home and he said “of course, if it’s urgent”. I said I think it is because the pain and bleeding is getting worse and I’m starting to feel lightheaded and our 2 year old is unattended in his playroom right now. We have no friends or family near that I could call who would get to us quicker than he could.

I had to clean myself up, crawl down stairs to take paracetamol, make my son his lunch and then put him down for a nap. At this point my husband still isn’t home. He was working approx 30 mins away and took closer to 60 mins to get back. Hours later when I asked, it was because he’d stopped at Tesco to pick up some beers.

I ended up very poorly, losing lots of blood, lightheaded, vomiting etc and he had to take me to A&amp;E. By the time I was discharged it was almost 8pm. Last week, I had said I’d make him his favourite dinner for his birthday which he reminded me when we were almost home. I said I wasn’t feeling up to it and that whatever takeaway he wants is on me. He said “for fuck sake” under his breath and then muttered something along the lines of “this bullshit has ruined my birthday”. He didn’t stop to get any takeaway. He just drove straight home. He put our son to bed and I went to bed and I’m not sure what he did after. I didn’t see him this morning as he had already left for work. He’s not messaged me all day and he got home a few hours ago (it’s now 8. 40pm) and he’s been giving me silent treatment. I tried to speak to him about an hour or so ago and he ignored me and I called him a disgrace. He slammed the bedroom door and locked me out of the bedroom. His mum has since messaged me and said I need to be patient as he’s also had a loss. She didn’t ask how I was or anything. He’s obviously speaking to his mum but why isn’t he opening up and speaking to me? She said I was harsh?

I’m feeling utterly emotionally neglected right now. My body has been through emotional and physical hell. I understand that my miscarriage came at a fucking inconvenient time for him as it was his birthday and all. I’m not sure if it’s the hormones making me feel crazy but is it nuts to contemplate divorce? AITAH for calling him a disgrace?

1hlcdzb,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to give up my front-row spot at a concert to someone claiming to be disabled?,"A couple of weeks ago, I traveled to another country to see an artist I’ve been a fan of for six years. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, and I’d been waiting months for it. I sacrificed a lot financially and mentally to make it happen. Since it was my first (and probably only) time seeing them, I went all out: I bought GA tickets and arrived at the queue at **5 a.m.** (even though the doors wouldn’t open until 6:30–7 p.m.) in freezing cold weather. I waited all day—hungry, cold, and dehydrated—but it was worth it because when the doors opened, I secured a **front-row barricade spot**, right up against the stage. This was my dream spot.

Then, a guy behind me tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was disabled. He said the venue was supposed to let disabled attendees in early, but they hadn’t. He asked me to give him my spot at the barricade. Here’s the thing: I know this venue is **very accommodating for disabled attendees**. I actually have friends with disabilities who’ve gone to shows here, and the staff always ensures they get to the front row safely during a designated time frame before it gets too crowded. 

Now, I’m a **very short person (155 cm/5’1”)**, and this guy was **extremely tall**—easily over 5.5 If I gave him my spot, I wouldn’t be able to see anything at all because he would completely block my view. I honestly would’ve been willing to move if he wasn’t so tall or if I could still see from the second row. However, in this case, I knew I’d lose the view I had waited more than 10 hours for.

I tried to compromise. I pointed out that the **right side of the barricade** was still open and suggested he go there. Since he’s so tall, he’d still have a great view and could hold onto the rail for support. However, he refused, saying the view wasn’t as good as where I was. While we were talking, that section filled up, and he became more insistent. He said he’d ""have a hard time"" if he couldn’t take my spot.

At this point, I got frustrated and explained:

1. If his disability was that serious, he should be in the **accessible section**, which is specifically designed for attendees with disabilities.
2. If he insisted on being in the standing section, he should’ve brought a support aid, like a cane (I’d seen someone nearby with one).
3. If he spoke to security, they could escort him to the **front-row disabled seating**, which has a fantastic view and is much more accommodating.

After hearing this, he called me an ""asshole,"" told me to ""get fucked,"" and left.

I feel like he just wanted my spot and wasn’t being truthful. The venue offers several options for disabled attendees, and I tried to direct him to alternatives. I feel bad for saying no but I don’t think it was fair for him to ask me to sacrifice my entire experience.

So, **AITA** ?

EDIT: Regarding the man’s height, after everyone pointed it out I've realized I indeed made a mistake. I don’t live in a country that uses the metric system and I should’ve double-checked my conversion instead of estimating from memory. I meant to say he was over 170 cm, probably around 175-180.",18156,0.97,18156,0,18735.0,579.0,860,1735042598.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hlcdzb/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_frontrow_spot_at/,False,True
1nt7r7t,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting our friend to ever come back to our house after he ate literally everything we owned?,"My husband and I live abroad. Earlier this year, a mutual acquaintance (let’s call him “K”) reached out saying he’d been scammed with an apartment rental and had nowhere to stay. At first, we only offered a weekend, but he was polite, helped around the house, and seemed grateful, so we ended up letting him stay the full 20 days he’d asked for.

During that time, some things rubbed us the wrong way. He never bought groceries, and multiple times he pretended he was going to pay but “forgot his wallet” or claimed he could only use Apple Pay (not accepted at our local supermarket). He’d eat way more than his share (once my husband and I shared half a pizza and he ate the other pizza and a half without contributing). Still, we felt bad for him, so we let it go.

We stayed friendly, and a few months later we were planning a 17-day trip. Since he was struggling with rent, we offered him to stay at our place in exchange for taking care of our dog. I even wrote a Google Doc with instructions for the house, dog care, gym access, etc. I told him he could eat anything that was going to expire (fruit, veggies, yogurt, etc.).

When we came back… EVERYTHING was gone. And I mean everything. The entire fridge, freezer, pantry. He finished two jars of jam, a jar of peanut butter, a giant Costco bottle of olive oil, condiments, rice, snacks, cheese, even my husband’s supplements (creatine, protein, collagen). He completely destroyed a ceramic pan. He consumed things that usually last us six months in just 2 weeks. I honestly suspect he might have taken stuff with him because it’s insane how much was missing.

I didn’t confront him except to ask him to replace the pan, which he mocked me about (“it’s just a pan, why are you making it a big deal?”). I felt deeply disrespected. Now he keeps texting me, acting like nothing happened, and wants to hang out. I told my husband I don’t want him in our home ever again. My husband says I’m being too harsh, and if he wants to stay friends, that’s his choice, but I feel completely taken advantage of and disrespected.

So… AITA for not wanting to see this guy ever again and refusing to let him come back to our house?",17875,0.96,17875,0,18652.0,777.0,1305,1759116518.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nt7r7t/aita_for_not_wanting_our_friend_to_ever_come_back/,False,True
1lvxapt,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to punish my daughter after she blew up on the classclown that she dint want at her birthday party?,"My daughter is 13 and she goes to a small school. Her grade only has 18 students (10 boys and 8 girls). My daughter also has other friends from the sports she does. We plan to have her go to a much larger high school in the future. Her 13th birthday party was last weekend and I asked who she wanted to invite, she wanted to invite 7 of the girls from her class and 5 from her soccer team. The one girl she doesn't want to invite is name Kelly.

My daughter doesn't like Kelly, she is the class clown in her grade and my daughter hides her annoying and attention seeking. I asked her why she didn't want her there and her response was ""she ruins school for me all the time, I don't want her to ruin my birthday."" I agreed with her list and sent the invites out.

My ex-wife is invited to all her major milestone instead of us doing separate events. I learned an hour beofre the party my ex-wife sent an invte to Kelly since her mom found out about the party. My daughter was not happy to see her (it was a suprise for her), I told her to enjoy the party.

It was going well until the cake came out, my daughter wanted a glitter cake (when you blow out the candles glitter goes everywhere). While everyone was around the cake, Kelly took her fingers and swiped icing off the top layer of the cake. It ruined the cake and my daughter lost it. She yelled at Kelly, basically saying, "" what is wrong with you, this is why I didn't want you her and that you ruin everything."" She ran to her room after and Kelly was crying.

Kelly's parent is wanting an apolgy, my ex-wife wants her to apoligze as well. I am refusing to make her do that or punish her at all. I pointed out that my ex never should have invited her and to the mom that her child ruined the cake, and that at 12 years old should know better. They are calling me an ass and my daughter is just upset.,",17748,0.94,17748,0,18958.0,1210.0,1491,1752102621.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lvxapt/aita_for_refusing_to_punish_my_daughter_after_she/,False,True

I live in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom and I set up a bed in my home office because they wanted to stay at my house. They had been here for 4 days. 

The bathroom has been a big problem. He spends hours in there. After the first day, I talked to my sister about it. She says he has a condition where he needs the bathroom a lot. So I let it rest. On day 3, it was even worse. There was a time where I had to excuse myself to go to the store so I could use the bathroom twice because he wouldn’t leave. 

The last day i woke up at 4am and had to use the bathroom very badly. I knocked on the door and he said he’d be out in a minute. I told him I really had to go. It took him an hour to get out. The nearby store wasn’t open at that time and I had to do something I am not happy I had to do because I couldn’t wait. 

The next morning I told him he needs to get a hotel. I can’t be blocked from using the bathroom in my own home because he takes it hostage. I get he has a condition, but so do I. And I make sure I have my own bathroom when I travel so I don’t get in the way of other people needing the bathroom. 

My sister and her BIL were very upset and called me ableist. I told them what I had to do last night because he was in the bathroom for so long and they said I could’ve held it. I told them they need to leave and find a hotel or stay with other family, he just can’t stay here anymore.

1mvgpt2,AmItheAsshole,AITA for putting my hand over my SIL’s camera at my own birthday dinner after I told her no filming?,"I (29F) had a small bd dinner last weekend with my husband (31M), SIL “Lina” (27F), MIL and two friends at a normal but nice place. Lina’s an 'influencer"". She films literally everything - plates, forks, ppl breathing.

Three days before, I wrote in the family chat - please don’t film me. Food, room is fine, just not my face. She said “got u”.

We sit down and within like 10 mins her phone is up. I say quiet, “pls don’t point it at me.” She goes, “you look great, it’s just vibes.” Husband backs me, “she said no.” Lina rolls her eyes, lowers it… for maybe 2 minutes.

Then the cake comes (little sparkler, staff singing). Lina stands and points the camera right in my face like, “birthday girl reveal!” I put my hand over the lens and said, “stop” I didn’t grab the phone or touch her, just covered the camera for a second. She snaps that I “ruined her shot” and this is her job. MIL says to “let it go for one night.” I said that it’s my night - actually.

It got awkward fast. Server was right there, I felt embarassed. Husband tried to change the subject, but Lina kept muttering about how she had to scrap “everything.” I even paid for my own dessert (long story) and we left pretty quick.

Next morning Lina texts that I “humiliated” her and made her look unprofessional in front of everyone. MIL says I should’ve moved seats if I didn’t want to be in frame. Husband says my boundary is fair but maybe I “made a scene” by doing it during the song when eyes were already on me.

She’s posted me before without asking and co-workers mentioned it. I’ve asked her to blur/remove and it turns into drama, which is why I set the boundary in writing before dinner.

1irk46j,AmItheAsshole,AITA for “kicking a pregnant woman out of her seat”,"Ok so this happened a few hours ago and I’ve only just calmed down, because I hate conflict. 

Basically I was doing a long travel day( 5 ish hours) so I booked my train in advance to ensure that I had a reserved seat. When I get on the train a woman is in my seat, so I politely inform her that I think that’s my seat show her my ticket and ask her to move. She checks her ticket and just says well I must have sit in the wrong seat and puts her head down. I say that it’s my seat and could I please sit in it. At this point her partner sitting opposite her starts speaking at me in what I perceive to be an aggressive tone. He suggests I find another seat( which there are none because it’s busy) and I say but I booked that seat and there are no other available seats in the carriage . He then raises his voice and says well someone else is in our seats and that his missus is pregnant. I say I understand and that I have a heart defect( which I do) and said everyone has their own medical issues and reasons standing for long periods of time might be difficult. And here I could be the asshole , I ask him to not speak to me in an aggressive tone , and that I will make a complaint.  He then starts swearing at me and I ask him to stop. Eventually the woman gets up and allows me to sit there and he continues to berate me saying he hopes I feel good for myself and that I’m quiet now I have my seat, when really I just stopped engaging as I felt there was no point. 

One of the men who was sat beside him offers that him and his partners sit in the seats opposite me ( it’s a table seat) at which point he sits his partner down and then laughs at me and points in my face. Eventually when the ticket inspector comes around they are asked to movr to their assigned seats and she asks if I’m ok as another passenger had made a complaint on my behalf.
Even so was I the asshole ? Should I have just left them alone as she was pregnant? And did I in any way escalate the situation ? 

EDIT : as I don’t know how able I’ll be to respond to all the comments, thank you sincerely to everyone that has engaged with this post. I’ve learnt a lot about myself and my ability to let anxiety and over thinking get in the way of trusting my decisions. I honestly came into writing this thinking that I escalated the situation, so to have people affirm that it’s just standing my ground and that that is alright has been really gratifying. It has taught me however I have a way to go with standing up for myself, and not being such a people pleaser. If I don’t get to respond just know I appreciate your engagement with my post nonetheless and this has really helped to calm me and give me insight after an incredibly stressful situation.",16990,0.96,16990,0,17729.0,739.0,1296,1739799788.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1irk46j/aita_for_kicking_a_pregnant_woman_out_of_her_seat/,False,True
1i8cj5t,AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving a family gathering and taking the cake with me after getting my feelings hurt?,"I (27F) hit one year sober (from alcohol) at the beginning of the year. This was a huge accomplishment for me. It was bigger to me than finishing college. I told my family that next time we were together for family dinner I had something to celebrate. This all happened at my mom’s. The kids were playing and the adults were hanging out. I took the moment to share that I’d reached 1 year sober and how good I felt about it. 

They went with “Ohh, that’s what you were talking about” and “Has it been a year already?”

I am embarrassed to admit I hoped someone would say they’re proud of me.

My BIL Steve looked at my sister and they both said “Well…” at the same time and she said “Since we’re all here, (Niece) just got into (a specific gymnastics thing). It’s been a LONG road but she did it!”

Steve popped some wine they'd brought and started giving everyone glasses/cups. He made eye contact with me and his face fell. I had this gnawing feeling so got up from the table. I took a walk.

I tried to get through the moment mentally so I could be present for my niece to celebrate her success. But when I got back to the house my sister asked me why I left without saying anything. I said I needed a minute to myself.

She looked at me funny and said “Okayyyy…”

I said I’d shared something I was very proud of and she bulldozed over it. My mom put her hand up and asked me what my news was. I said that I’d told them. I hit one year sober. Mom said my generation always wanted praise for doing the bare minimum, that wasn’t an accomplishment it was just what I needed to do, like graduating high school.

I tried to make it through to dinner but found myself just not in the mood anymore. I decided to go home. 

**Here is the direct thing I am being called a butthead for:** Id brought a small berry chantilly cake (my favorite) to share after dinner. It was the thing I decided I earned. The kids had definitely seen it. On my way out I decided to take it home with me. 

I guess when they realized the cake wasn’t in the garage fridge anymore, my sister called to ask me why I took it. I said I did because it was MY cake to celebrate MY accomplishment.

She said, word for word “Are you fucking serious? Oh my god Emma, GROW UP. You are such a fucking baby.”

My Mom later texted me directly to tell me how disappointed she was that I threw a tantrum because my niece got more attention than me. I don’t think her read of what happened is right, but that is why I am asking you guys. Am I the asshole because I took home the cake in the end? Was that really childish of me, considering the kids saw it and then didn’t get any?

As I was putting on my shoes to leave, Steve found me and directly apologized and said that he was completely oblivious in the moment. I know he did not do anything to intentionally hurt me.

**EDIT FOLLOW UP:** Hi everyone, I just wanted to follow up and say thank you to everyone for the responses. I have a lot to think about when I next go to therapy (today, actually) and work on. I do want to clear up a few things that I've seen come up a lot on the comments:

I am not in AA. I'd tried AA before and it was not compatible for me. It works for a lot of people very well and I'm happy for you if it works for you. So, stuff about ""the steps"" and ""personal inventory"" are not relevant to me.

It wasn't a party for my niece, it was just a family dinner. The cake \*was mine\* and wasn't brought \*for\* my niece. I didn't take it \*because\* I wanted to ""get back"" at them. I took it because it's my favorite cake and I wanted to eat it because it was my thing that I earned. 

 I don't know why they opened wine for my niece getting into the gymnastic program. But I also don't think it's my place to say anyone else has a drinking problem, and I'd prefer to have eyes on my own paper. :)",16984,0.97,16984,0,17526.0,542.0,4512,1737662600.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i8cj5t/aita_for_leaving_a_family_gathering_and_taking/,False,True

I asked nicely, then labeled stuff. No change. So I got creative: I bought a pack of stick-on googly eyes and put them on everything. Milk? Eyes. Leftover spaghetti? Judging you. Even taped one to a banana.

It worked. He said it “creeped him out” and he stopped eating my stuff.

Now he says I’m being passive-aggressive and “creating an emotionally hostile refrigerator.”

1hrujjz,AmItheAsshole,AITA for accidentally ruining my autistic boyfriends safe food,"My boyfriend loves stew, he wants to eat it every day for every meal. His favorite stew is beef tips and vegetables from a local place, but it’s really expensive. Like $47 for a big bowl (they don’t do small orders for takeout) and he is grossed out by leftovers so more than half of it gets wasted. We’ve had a couple of arguments about it, he says I don’t understand his brain, I say he doesn’t understand our budget.

recently I looked up some recipes, including doing a dissection of the takeout soup, and tried my hand at making a home cooked replacement for stew night. He loved it for a few days, and then one night he was hanging out with me in the kitchen and saw me put tomato paste into the pot, he was really upset and demanded that I make the soup without the paste. I told him it wouldn’t taste the same and he said it would be better because he hates tomatoes, they’re not a safe food for him. So I made the soup with no tomato paste and big surprise, something felt off about it to him. Instead of admitting that the tomato paste was necessary he threw a fit and told me he didn’t want home cooked food anymore if I was going to “play with him” and not take his safe foods seriously, he thinks I changed more than just the tomato paste in an effort to get him to admit he was wrong.

$400 in stew orders later I had an idea to ask the chef when we were picking up the order if there was any tomato products in the stew, and lo and behold there is tomato in the recipe, fucking tomato paste. In my mind this was great because I thought he would get over it if he knew his original perfect stew had tomato paste like “oh I guess tomato paste isn’t so bad then” but it was the exact opposite. He walked out of the restaurant without saying anything and then refused to eat the stew that night and hasn’t ordered it again, and he’s been ignoring me while sulking around the house, using his whiny voice a lot, and slamming things. His sister also texted me to tell me I’m a selfish asshole for needing to “get back at him” by taking his favorite food away. 

I literally just wanted to stop spending insane amounts of money on stew, I wasn’t trying to hurt him or ruin his life. I’m not autistic, I can’t really wrap my head around caring this much about a single ingredient, I genuinely didn’t see this reaction coming. We’ve been together for four years and he’s only had three other fits like this, the other ones were pretty reasonable. Those were also a little less intense and didn’t include input from his family, this is the first time anyone in his family has EVER spoke to me like this. So I’ve been back and forth between “yall are overreacting” and “what have I done”.

AITA? It sounds so dumb when I write it all out but living it has made me feel physically sick with regret, I can’t think straight anymore.

ETA: I’m getting ready for work right now so I can’t respond to individual comments but there’s some recurring confusion/questions I wanted to clear up because it might effect the answers:

1/ The stew place is a catering place with a mini-restaurant, so every time we order takeout we’re ordering a catering amount pretty much, it’s not stew made of gold lol
2/ We order from there 2-3 nights a week, it’s not the *only* thing he eats it’s just the top 5 foods for him, he doesn’t eat this unreasonably every single day.
3/ He has a job and contributes with money, I’m not funding his entire diet. We do mix money, so even though “he” pays for the meal half the time it does still feel like “we’re” losing money. He works part time and I work full time, bills are probably split 70-30.

1klzbca,AmItheAsshole,AITA for grounding my stepdaughter for selling my formal dress?,"I 37F have a stepdaughter, Amy, 16F. Amy was looking for formal dresses, and I mentioned that I have my old formal dresses. She picked my old prom dress to wear, and she has kept it in her wardrobe since wearing it at prom. I don't fit in my old dresses anymore, and I kept them and some other clothes to hand down to my kids, however, I have two sons who aren't interested. Since my nieces, 15F and 13F are interested in my clothes, I planned to give them the rest once they were old enough to fit them.

Amy left her earbuds in her sweatpants pocket and turned on the washing machine. When she asked for new ones, me and her dad told her to save up to buy new ones (she works part time) as she wanted an expensive brand new pair and not the wired earphones I had offered.

Amy went to stay with her mom, and when she got back, she had the new earbuds she wanted, so I asked if her mom had bought them for her, and she said she had resold my dress on a second-hand site and bought herself the earphones. The dress is 100% silk, one of a kind, and the brand doesn't exist anymore. I was really upset to hear she had sold my dress, without even asking.

I confiscated her earbuds and told her I would give them back when she repaid me the cost of what she sold the dress for. My husband thinks I am being too harsh, as I wasn't explicit on whether I was lending or giving her the dress. Amy has gone to live with her mom since and thinks I am being unfair. I am not sure if I have taken it too far and if I should stand my ground.

Edit: I have got a disturbing amount of PMs asking me if I called the police and comments literally bullying a kid who made a mistake... I hope most of the commenters never become/are stepparents. I just wanted to answer a few questions after this post got some attention:

The dress sold for £150 recently, which isn't a lot, but it had more sentimental value for me. Amy used the money to partly pay for new AirPods. I spoke to my husband again, who apologised for being more neutral earlier and thinks my grounding was justified. I also told Amy's mom, who got my dress back from the person Amy sold it to and agreed with me to ground Amy and apologised on her behalf. I DID NOT call the police or sue my stepdaughter, Amy has since apologised, and we have made up. Kids make mistakes sometimes, like you did at their age, and I was definitely more upset when I made the post than I am now.",16681,0.94,16681,0,17818.0,1137.0,1798,1747175061.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1klzbca/aita_for_grounding_my_stepdaughter_for_selling_my/,False,True
1lkye23,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not cooking breakfast for my niece and nephew?,"My (36, M) sister (34, F) moved into my house about 2 months ago with her 2 kids (7M, 4F) after she ended a really bad relationship

I’ve always been an early-ish riser and like to get up and make myself some breakfast around 7 or 8am. Nothing spectacular, just whatever I felt like that day

When my sister moved in, I realized quickly that she liked to sleep in. Some days she was up as late as 1pm…I gave her the benefit of the doubt since I knew how hard her break up was for her 


Since my sister slept so late daily, she wouldn’t get up and take care of her kids. I got into a routine with my niece and nephew that basically whatever I cooked myself for breakfast, I’d make enough for them as well until the other morning 

I woke up and had an urge to make huevos rancheros. The kids immediately started complaining that they didn’t want that and wanted something different

I was nice and ended up making them pancakes since it’s not their fault that their mom is really struggling 

The next morning, I was making breakfast potatoes and eggs but all I heard was “we don’t want that. We want something different” so again, I obliged…finally after 3 mornings of my unwanted food critics getting a separate meal, I finally told them “I’m no longer cooking 2 different meals for breakfast. If you don’t like what I’m making, go ask your mom to get up and do it”

So, they went upstairs to wake her up, but she still didn’t come downstairs until after 1pm. The kids immediately started complaining that I “refused to feed them” and my sister was PISSED

She started in about how they need to be fed by a certain time and a bunch of other things that she said to try and intentionally hurt me

I snapped and told her “look I know you’re depressed, but wake up and take care of your fu**ing kids instead of expecting me to do it”

She got quiet after that and is still giving me the cold shoulder, but I know she’s expecting me to apologize.

Sorry this was long winded, but let me have it. AITA?

1ip5gou,AmItheAsshole,AITA for yelling at my friends and leaving dinner after they all made fun of me and gave me a gay intervention?,"I (21F) went out to dinner with 5 friends, 1 guy, 4 girls. For context, I look very masculine (short hair, deep voice, no makeup, masculine style, etc.), sometimes I get mistaken for a man. Usually if it's by someone I'm never gonna see again i.e. cashier/waiter I don't really care to correct them.

My friends and I were having dinner at a nice fancy place and the waiter came to our table and he mistook me for a man. One of my friends responds ""Oh, she's not a man, she's just a lesbian"". Everyone laughs and the waiter apologized. After he left, I asked my friend ""why did you say that?"". I have never said or indicated in any way that I'm a lesbian, because I'm not. I've never had a boyfriend, but that's because I'm not interested in a romantic relationship, but we have talked about male celebrities we find attractive. I thought it was clear I was straight.

My friend rolled her eyes at my question and said ""Oh c'mon, we all know you're a lesbian"". I was shocked. More friends jumped in and said ""yeah, you don't have to lie to us"". I wasn't lying. They started making jokes about me ""dressing like a lesbian"", ""hiding my sexuality"", ""being in a glass closet"", ""everyone knows"", ""it's 2025 no one cares"", etc. It all seemed like it wasn't a joke and they actually believed it. One of my friends Eva even joked ""you were obviously in love with Ines"". I showed genuine shock at this remark and she reassured me ""It's okay, we all don't mind if you're gay"".

Ines was an on/off childhood friend of mine and our friendship ended badly a few months ago, I was very upset by it and confided in my friends. I never thought they would use it against me.

I told them firmly that I'm not a lesbian, this isn't funny and I was not in love with Ines. Once they saw I was being serious about this, their tone and attitude became less jokey. They started lecturing me on self-acceptance, being in denial, internalized homophobia (I'm not homophobic), heteronormativity, compulsory heterosexuality, etc. It was like some sort of gay intervention. I found it absolutely ridiculous.

I yelled at them for being bad friends because I couldn't even dress how I want or talk to them about my troubles and I left the restaurant.

It's the morning after and I have serious regret, I don't know what to say to them and what to do.

1jzb2tl,AmItheAsshole,AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me,"When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

Edited to add: at the time, it never occurred to me that I should have told him. I thought I was doing the right thing by protecting both of them. That pretty much summarizes my childhood.

1nobfes,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not answering the door when my ex’s mom showed up at my apartment unannounced?,"This happened a couple of years ago but I was talking about crazy MIL stories with a friend and she thinks I was an AH.

I have sole custody of my children. My ex and his family live about a 9 hour drive from me. One day at around 9am there was knocking on my bedroom window. I peeked through the bottom of the blinds and just see woman’s sneakers. So I peek higher and make eye contact with my ex’s mom. All I can think is WTF?

The apartments where I live are not gated so anybody can drive onto the property, just not go in buildings without a key. Which means, ex’s mom couldn’t knock on my door because she couldn’t enter my building. Anyway, now that she’s seen me I change and go see why she’s there. Only reason why she has my address is because a few months back she asked to mail some stuff for the kids &amp; I dumbly gave her my address. She tells me she was in the neighborhood. I asked her why she didn’t call me before arriving and she said it was a “last minute decision”. I let her in and she sees the kids for a bit. When she leaves I tell her next time she needs to give me a heads up before arriving, and I’m not talking 10 minutes before, I need at least a 1 week notice.

So, this is where I might be the AH. About 4 months later she pulls this stunt AGAIN. When I hear the tapping on my window. I know exactly who it is. I don’t bother looking out the window. She starts calling me. After the 5^(th) call, I answer. She tells me to open up because she wants to see the kids. I’m like what? I’m not even home- why she didn’t tell me she was coming? I’m 45 minutes away visiting my dad with the kids. She demands dad’s address - I refuse to give it to her. I tell her I have no idea when I will be home. Yes, complete lie. Anyway, she doesn’t believe me, she thinks I’m home, again says it was a last minute decision. I hang up on her, I’m getting texts from ex demanding I let his mom see the kids. I tell him what I told her -I’m not home.

Imagine my surprise when I hear the police banging on my door a few minutes later! I don’t answer. I get a call from a random number - the police officer. He is there to perform a wellness check because ex’s mom hasn’t heard from me in 3 days and she’s extremely worried. Also, according to him, it is illegal not to answer the door when a police officer knocks. I tell him she is lying- I just spoke to her on the phone, she showed up unannounced. I made it clear to her not to do that, and I am out with family and I don’t need to come back just because she showed up unannounced, she is ex’s mom and I don’t have to talk to her.  After that phone call I get a text from ex calling me an AH and how hard would it have been to let his mom see the kids when she drove all the way there just to see them.

I want to make it clear – I don’t mind her visiting, I don’t mind her being around my kids – but I cant stand her showing up unannounced and demanding to see my kids like that. It was like she was on a weird power trip.",16407,0.96,16407,0,17120.0,713.0,884,1758614326.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nobfes/aita_for_not_answering_the_door_when_my_exs_mom/,False,True
1k2fl3c,AmItheAsshole,AITA for laughing at my stepson and ruining his wedding?,"Throw away, shortened for character count. 

For context, I have been married to my husband for just over 20 years. We started dating when my stepkids were 5 and 3. Our kids are: Adam (28, stepkid #1), Ben (26, stepkid #2), Charles (20), David (17), and Ellie (13). 

Adam is getting married at the end of summer to his fiancé Alice (27). We have all been very excited for them. All of the kids have roles for the wedding, Charles is the best man, the other two boys are groomsman, and Ellie is a jr bridesmaid. 

Last weekend we had a dinner for my husband’s birthday, all of the kids attended along with Alice. The topic of the wedding came up again, and this is where it started to go downhill. Ellie brought up that she was SO excited to go dress shopping and that we planned to go to a bigger city in a few weeks to get her a dress and me a stepmom of the groom dress. 

At that, Alice looked at Adam sideways and responded that we only needed to worry about one dress, Ellie’s. Ellie kind of laugh and said “what are you expecting mom to wear? A suit?”. Alice responded with “(My name) isn’t going. You know we are keeping our guest list very limited to only family and a few close friends.” WHAT. Adam and Alice have been to our house numerous times for holidays, dinners, just to say hi since they’ve been engaged, this has never been brought up. 

Pretty quickly things escalated. The cliff notes version is that Charles asked them to clarify if they were choosing to uninvite me now or if I was never invited. Alice confirmed the latter. why? Adam said it’s because I’m not his mom. Charles, David, and Ellie argued with Adam and Alice that none of them were going to go if I wasn’t invited. That it was cruel to leave me out given I’ve been his parent for a majority of his life and loved him like my own. My husband and I admittedly sat there for a minute just fucking shocked. 

Adam finally turned to my husband and said, “well?” My husband told him he wouldn’t be going either. Adam then turned to me and asked if I was really going to let everyone ruin his wedding on my behalf. Here’s where I might be the asshole: I just laughed. Idk what came over me but the entire thing was just so ridiculous that laughing was the only thing I could get out. I told my husband I’d be waiting in the car and left. And then promptly bawled my eyes out.

Anyways, Charles, David and Ellie are not talking to Adam. Adam called my husband yesterday to try and smooth things over. He was still adamant I’m not invited and it’s their wedding. He also requested I apologize for laughing at him. My husband told him tough shit. It’s their wedding and they can invite whoever they want, but they cant control who will actually go. He said THEY owe ME an apology and that Adam should be ashamed of himself. 

I’m getting texts now asking wtf I did and why I’m being a “stepmonster and ruining the wedding” AITA?

1iy5n9x,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my GF if she can take a shower?,"My GF really only showers once a week, twice if I'm lucky.

Typically we go to the gym together, and I've often asked her why she doesn't shower, and she always comes with things like ""Oh women don't really sweat much, and I sweat very little even for women's standards"". And I don't buy it, because I can smell. I used to just suck it up, because I know she's extremely sensitive. Kinda NSFW here but, this even affected our sexlife. I used to love going down on her, but after not showering after workouts/long work days etc I've lost interest.

Fast forward a bit. She now starts using the sauna at the gym. Maybe on average 2 times a week.  
She. Still. Refuses. To. Shower. I've said ""There's just no way you don't sweat in the sauna, just me sitting 5 minutes in there gets me soaked"". She says she doesn't sweat much there either. And she sits there for 20 minutes.

Things are now worse. I can smell her, very badly. Almost to the point where I try not to breathe in too close to her because it's not good. I've tried so long to give hints to get her to shower more, like: ""Hey do you want to take a shower together ;)?"" But she can't take the hint, and says ""Why would we do that, there's only room for 1 under the water anyway""....

One evening, she wanted to lie down on the floor, and stare at a world map she has. She invited me to lie down next to her, and just talk about where we want to go etc. I lasted for about 1 minute, before I had to make up some dumb excuse as to why I had to get up. She then get's upset and says something along the lines of ""Why are you leaving? You never do stuff with me"" The truth is just I can't be close to her for long.

I'm not even sure if I started to resent her, because it was only this one thing that was bugging me in the relationship. But maybe I did, and that's my fault for being bad at communicating to her.

Anyway, I couldn't hold it any longer. I tried one last time to ask if she wanted to take a shower with me, to show I did want to do stuff with her, but she declined. Then I said ""I know you say you don't sweat, but I can smell. I don't like the smell of sweat etc and it being a popular gym we go to, I would just appreciate if you showered a bit more"".

She freaked out. WW3 started. She accused me of things and asked if I found her disgusting etc. It almost felt like she wanted me to think she's disgusting for some messed up reason? Like this was an easy way to create distance between us, have less sex, and all that. I'm not sure, maybe I'm overthinking it. It's just to me, it feels awfully obvious to shower if not daily, at least every other day. She said she doesn't want to shower her hair often, but still, you can shower your body.

Our relationship is borderline over because I hurt her, so AITA? What could I have done differently?

^(Irrelevant but: Is it normal that women shower less than men? I was always under the assumption it was the opposite.)

**UPDATE: 28/02**

We broke up.

She refused to accept she was ""disgusting"" by not showering, and did not see anything wrong. Impossible for me to change her mind, when she is deadset on no wrongdoing. No point for me to argue with someone like that.

Seems like there was a lot of unresolved trauma in her past. I was aware of it, but not the severity of it and how it still affected her. One of her first sentences to come out when I confronted her again about it was ""Break up with me then."" Like she was challenging me or something. It really made me feel weird. Instead of us coming to an agreement together, she went very defensive and just attacked me.

She struggled with having girlfriends, as she was scared of them stealing her current boyfriend or something, so she always went to hang out with guys. She loved getting validation from guys as well, so she ended up having a lot of friends with benefits over the years he said. There's a lot of stuff I did not know, but that's just not my thing. For some reason I almost feel used in a way, because I feel like to her I was just another FWB, but she was someone I actually saw a future with.

Ultimately, what made us break up though, was the fact that she sees herself as ""over"" men or me in this case. **She believes women are holy. (Her words, not mine).**  
She was the taker in the relationship, and I was the giver. It worked for some time, but I started resenting her, and did not want to be as much of a giver for her anymore. I started to notice she did not appreciate my efforts, and she did not reciprocate much at all.

Hopefully she will find a guy who will put her on the highest pedestal out there, but that guy is not me. All power to her.",16283,0.97,16283,0,16803.0,520.0,4241,1740517106.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iy5n9x/aita_for_asking_my_gf_if_she_can_take_a_shower/,False,True

I want to spend it alongside my girlfriend and our 7 month old. However her brother asked us to babysit his kid on that day because him and his girlfriend want to go out.

Her brother doesn’t like me and the feeling is mutual and we don’t speak. He only talks to my girlfriend when he needs a favour. His kid is great and we’ve babysat him multiple times.

1lii93a,AmItheAsshole,AITA for shutting someone down when they tried to talk to me at the gym?,"So, for context, I (F32) don’t talk to anyone at my gym outside of saying hi and bye to the people who work there, and having polite etiquette when asking someone if they’re using something/saying thank you when they’re done. This is partially for efficiency, but mostly because I go to the gym stoned AF and I’m in my zone and I don’t want to talk to anyone. 

Last week, after my work out, I walked over to the food carts by my gym to pick up tacos. While I was there, some guy (M40+) stopped me and said he went to the same gym. I had never noticed him before but he like insisted on walking with me and was talking to me. I was kind of annoyed — just because you see me on the street with my headphones out doesn’t mean it’s an invitation to talk to me. I made small talk and tried to be polite. Got out as quick as I could. 

So the other day, when I’m at the gym foam rolling out with my headphones in, this guy just beelines to me while I’m trying to avoid eye contact, and squats down next to me to say hi and give me a fist bump. I give him a quick heads up acknowledge him but ignore the fist bump. Avoid eye contact the rest of the time I’m there. 

And then today, this guy comes into the gym and sees me. I immediately avoid eye contact and he doesn’t come up to me, so I think he gets the picture. But then, when I’m doing leg lifts, he comes over and tries to give me a fist bump. 

So I take out my headphone and I say “Look man, I don’t want to do this. I’m here to work out, I’m not here to make friends. I don’t want to talk to you, okay.” And he starts to say “I was just saying hi.” And I respond with “Yeah, I get it. Please don’t.” And put my headphone back in and kept working out. 

I realize anyone who saw this probably thought I was a giant AH. But, I don’t think someone’s need for connection overrides my need to have a good workout. So, AITAH?

UPDATE:

For people saying this would have been different if he was an attractive guy. I stumble and get awkward no matter who it is if the conversation needs to go beyond more than a single question and response. Men, women, children. This isn’t a “want it” or “don’t want it” situation as much as it’s a “I’m not in a headspace where I can have human conversation.” 

For people saying this is the same type of person who wonders why guys don’t ask them out: I keep a little post it note in my gym bag that says “Hi, my name is (name). I think you’re cute, but I want to respect your gym time. Text me if you want to get coffee sometime.” I’ve never given it to anyone, but it’s there if I ever feel like I need it. 

Anyway, I’m at work. Hope everyone has a great day!

FINAL UPDATE:

Wow. While I figured posting this might be a little divisive, I didn’t expect it to blow up like this.

I went to the gym today and had one of the best workouts I’ve had in a long time — partly because I was fueled by the overwhelming support I received from people who understood the importance of asserting boundaries. So thank you to everyone who saw where I was coming from.

For anyone who still thinks I’m the AH — I can live with that. But before I go, I want to share something that happened to me a couple of months ago. Maybe it’ll give you something to chew on.

I was at the same gym, in the middle of isolated bicep curls. End of the rep, second-to-last set to failure. I was slowing the movement, fully concentrated, eyes closed.

When I opened them — a stranger’s face was three inches from mine.

Startled, I set the weight down and looked over to see a plump, middle-aged man in a baseball cap. I took out one of my headphones, still in shock, and all I could say was, “What the f***?!”

He then grabbed my arms and forced them back onto the machine’s handles, saying “One more!”

I pulled away and snapped, “Who the f*** do you think you are?”
His face fell as he muttered, “I was just admiring your work.”
I told him, “I’m in the middle of a f*ing set.”
He got defensive, saying, “Actually, I wanted to use that.”
I replied, “You can use it when I’m not in the middle of a set.”

He rolled his eyes and walked off. I was left shaking.

As I started to put my headphone back in, another man approached and waved. I took it back out, and he said, “You really shouldn’t have to put up with that.”

I smiled and said thanks. He walked away. I got back to my set.

⸻

Now here’s what I’ll say:
Baseball Cap Guy was way more out of line than the guy who approached me at the food carts — even by the third time, when I finally snapped at him.

I reported that incident to the gym manager. They took it seriously, walked through the whole event with me, and I gave the best description I could. I haven’t seen that man since. Whether he was banned or just stopped showing up, I don’t know.

As for the guy from the food carts — he hasn’t approached me again. We’ve been in the same space at the gym a couple times, but I’m very good at pretending people don’t exist during workouts. I appreciate that he respected my boundaries. I see no reason to report him.

⸻

But here’s what I want to leave you with:

The man who approached me right after that first incident — the one who said I shouldn’t have to put up with it —
Why did he say that to me, instead of to him?

Why is it easier to comfort a woman in distress than it is to call out the man who caused it?

I do think he meant well. I appreciated it in the moment.
But I still have to ask:

When given the choice between verbally comforting a woman and actually intervening —
Why do so many men choose comfort over protection?
Why is it harder to confront predatory behavior than it is to empathize with its aftermath?

That’s all I have to say. This will be my final update.",16176,0.85,16176,0,19642.0,3466.0,2972,1750689417.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lii93a/aita_for_shutting_someone_down_when_they_tried_to/,False,True
1n7ciex,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to leave my apartment for a day because of my muslim roommate’s conservative mom?,"Throwaway bc my roommates know my main account. So, I (23M) live in a college apartment with 2 roommates, both of which are women, and one of them is Muslim (let's call her sana). We all get along pretty well and have lived together for over a year with no issues. 

Yesterday, Sana told us her mom was visiting for the upcoming weekend. For info, her mom is very conservative and religious, and apparently doesn’t approve of her daughter living with male roommates (Awkward because I exist). As a result, Sana asked if I could leave the apartment entirely for the day her mom was visiting. Like, be out the whole day and even find somewhere else to sleep overnight.

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that bc I had a major assignment due, and I focus best when I’m working from home. I also didn’t wanna have to pack up all my stuff and go stay somewhere else just to keep up an appearance for someone I don’t even know. Additionally, I pay equal rent and felt like I had a right to be in the apartment.

Still, to try and compromise, I offered to stay in my room the entire day and be quiet/ not come out at all on the condition that I’d at least be allowed to quickly come out to make lunch or dinner, or they could just bring food to my room so I wouldn’t starve. I genuinely thought that was fair and respectful.

But no, sana wasn’t happy with that and insisted I should be out of the apartment entirely. She said her mom would “freak out” if she found out a guy lived there and it would cause a lot of drama in her family. I said while I understood her position, I wasn't going to dip from my own home, especially with a big deadline hanging over me.

She's still pissed and being pretty cold toward me now and also vented to our other roommate, who stayed neutral and said she saw both sides.

I really wasn’t trying to be difficult or disrespectful. I understand her cultural situation, but I also feel like it’s unfair to expect someone to completely vacate their home just to accommodate someone else’s family’s beliefs especially when I tried to find a middle ground.

So, AITA? 

Edit: Sana never chose to have male roommates, but it just so happened that she was practically bullied out of her old apartment (all female) for a conflict involving another girl and this was her last resort. Also, I'm so disheartened to see so much hate in the comments and it's enlightened me to be kinder and more understanding to sana and her situation. This was never meant to start a debate in the comments and I urge everyone to have more empathy and humanity. 

I will also be going home and asking a friend if I can stay over for a day. For everyone concerned about how if I let it by pass now, that it will happen again and again, I will speak to sana about this properly and urge her to talk to her mom. Thank you for all the level headed and empathetic comments I did get that helped me understand her perspective better, as I do care for her greatly and never want to hurt her if I can help it. One day isn't the end of the world and if it helps her, I've realised Id be happy to do it ",16129,0.9,16129,0,18145.0,2016.0,1339,1756899805.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n7ciex/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_my_apartment_for_a_day/,False,True
1njeb4g,AmItheAsshole,AITA For filing a police report on a good friend who was caught on video stealing my boyfriend's camera at a dinner? She has refused to help me either replace it in full or contribute to the cost of replacing it.,"More context: We were out to dinner one night at an expensive hotel. My boyfriend let me borrow his Canon G7X (1800) camera to bring to take pictures with my friends. At the conclusion of the dinner, I went up to the room and realized the camera was gone. I went back right down to the table and no one had seen it. I immediately got with hotel security and she is on video, clear as day, swiping the camera when my back was turned and shoving it in her purse. I covered for her initially with my friend, and contacted her to find a resolution. She had taken the camera with her and my other friends to a club after dinner, which I did not attend, and lost it there. For background, this is my good college friend who I know well (the camera thief). She has been taken on free trips to Coachella and St Barths on my dime (not kidding), as well as many other things. We have done a lot together and are good friends, so I expected her to feel sorry. Initially she lied, saying she did not have it. When I told her we had video, she confessed and then said yes she took it but lost it at the next bar she went to with my other friends. It is now gone. I asked her to help me replace it by going in on me with the cost. She has refused all measured or resolutions, and now I feel I have nothing left to do but file a police report and let them handle it. It is impacting my relationship, and I am furious my friend is not helping at all. Why should I be on the hook for something she stole? I have given her three weeks to help me resolve this, but she insists she is going to do nothing. I am being pressed by my boyfriend to either replace the camera or help him file a report with her info and the footage. I even asked her to just throw in half or less than half the cost to help, but she still refuses. I do not want her to get in trouble, but I am at the point where I feel she really does not care.

UPDATE: I sent her a text this AM telling her if I do not receive full cost of the camera or shipping confirmation of a new camera from an approved vendor to a provided address by end of day Friday, we will be filing a report with the police Saturday AM. I felt like an asshole typing this out to her, but I have to do it.

UPDATE X2: She told me she is sick of me and that I will be receiving a tracking number by 12 eastern on friday and not to blame her if the package is never receieved. I told her if she was my real friend, she would be sorry and in no way will I allow this to be flipped on me. Should I ask if the camera is new, or the one that ""Dissapeared""?

Update X3: She sent me a tracking number via FEDEX. It says it is awaiting package. I have asked her repeatedly if she is sending me the original camera, assuming it ""Magically"" turned up, or a new one. She refuses to answer and only tells me to stop bothering her.

Update X4: I am more and more convinced my friend (camera thief) took the camera hoping that I would just replace it for my boyfriend, gifting her a free camera. For background, this friend is heavily involved on instagram and loves taking pictures. The Canon G7 is COVETED by women because it is known as THE Instagram camera. Even if you wanted to buy one at full price, they are out of stock everywhere. Lets hope it gets returned with this tracking. FEDEX still says awaiting package even though shipping info was sent to them at 7 PM yesterday.

  
Update X4: Original Camera returned via fedex the other day. Has been given back to the boyfriend. However, the camera thief blocked me on all socials after this. Appeared she was trying to keep the camera for herself, and expected me to just buy a new one for the BF.",15942,0.92,15942,0,17460.0,1518.0,1872,1758118453.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1njeb4g/aita_for_filing_a_police_report_on_a_good_friend/,False,True

I was stunned. No one laughed, no one corrected her. My boyfriend just kind of chuckled awkwardly and changed the subject. I sat there in silence for another 20 minutes before excusing myself and leaving. I took an Uber home.

He called me later and said I embarrassed him by “making it a thing” and that I should’ve just “been chill” because “she didn’t mean anything by it.” He wants me to apologize to her for walking out “like a child.”

My mom and I have always had what I would refer to as rocky relationship, especially since I got engaged. She’s been oddly competitive, commenting on my body, comparing our rings, like  we are in a competition, saying things like “this day is as much about me as it is about you.”

  

I honestly thought  she was joking until she showed me the dress she bought,   a white, floor length gown that looks exactly like a bridal dress. And I I told her, flat out, she cannot wear that because in my opinion it doesn’t match the occasion . She got quiet, then burst into tears, saying it’s her “and this was an opportunity to feel beautiful before getting old” and that I’m selfish for not letting her have this one thing.

I felt really bad about this so I also offered to go shopping with her to find something elegant and more appropriate. 

And all of a sudden her countenance changed and then She told me I was controlling and ungrateful. What gave me peace was that My fiancé backed me up, as did my maid of honor. Now my mom is threatening not to come to the wedding, and my aunt says I should just “let her have this” to avoid drama.

1i7hxmz,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for not giving the “dollhouse” I built to my niece, but to my wife as a gift?","(It’s NOT a dollhouse, but I didn’t want anyone to think I was being misleading on purpose by saying I built a house)

I (28M) made my wife (28f) a replica of a house that’s known to fans of a musician, but wouldn’t mean much to others. It’s about 2 feet tall and wasn’t very complicated to build, but my wife had said a few times over last year that she thought it would be cool to have for little trinkets. She’s like a crow with her trinkets, I love it. She didn’t know I was making it for her, but I did sneakily involve her in its creation through having her make a couple Tiktoks when we were out together so I could get the colors right. She has no idea, lol. 

I was excited, so I showed a picture to my brother. He told me it was cool, but didn’t get the purpose. He showed it to my niece Ava (13f) who knew what it was and said she wanted one too. My brother asked if I would give it to Ava for her birthday.

I said no, it’s for my wife, but I could make one with Ava. It would help teach her some basic woodworking skills which they don’t do in schools here anymore. I’d like that. Brother said if it was so easy then I could make a second one for my wife and just give this one to Ava since her bday is the end of the month.

Again I said no, this was done specifically for my wife. He seemed to accept that but then came back to me and said “Isn’t it a little weird to make a dollhouse for an adult woman?” I told him it’s not a dollhouse, just a fancy shelf. He argued that makes it worse, because Ava would actually “play” with it.

He must have gone to complain to mom about it (he is the younger brother) because mom called me to tell me that it was “stupid” to give my wife a dollhouse. I tried to explain that it’s not a dollhouse but she just kept saying “that’s stupid.” 

This weekend I was at their house and Ava kept bringing up the house and laying it on thick with statements like “I’ve alway wanted one just like it.” She kept asking why my wife wanted a dollhouse. I said it’s not a dollhouse, but she kept asking why she needed a dollhouse.

I told my brother that he was encouraging his kid to be manipulative and I really didn’t like it, so I was going to leave. He told me that I was dangling the house over her head like McDonald’s and teasing her and that it made me a bad uncle.

Being a good uncle is important to me and I do feel for the girl because she’s a big fan too. I admit I have a blind spot for this because I don’t have kids and maybe I shouldn’t have shared the picture with my brother to begin with. Am I really the asshole for not just giving it to her? Yes, it WAS easy to make and I COULD make another quickly.

**Sorry guys Ava isn't my brother's biological daughter, there's a long story involved that I didn't want to add but I should've realized the age would be surprising.** I still see her as my niece regardless but I get why that would be alarming.

She recently asked me to help with the wedding planning, but when she showed me the list for her bridal party, I wasn’t on the list. I asked why, and she got awkward and said she had to make some choices. The party included her sister, her fiancés sister, and a few newer friends she’s known for a couple of years. She wanted a small party. 

I didn’t want to make it a big deal though. I congratulated her and figured I’d still be a guest. But then she started asking me for a lot of help, things like dress shopping, DIY decorations, venue hunting, making party favors, etc etc..

I finally told her, “Hey, I love you, but I feel weird doing all of this when I’m not even a bridesmaid.” She got angry and said that she thought I’d still want to be involved because we’re best friends. I told her I’d still be at the wedding, but I wasn’t gonna do all of this extra work when she didn’t even consider me close enough to be at her bridal party.

1kxi2yw,AmItheAsshole,AITA for eating ice cream every night just like I always do and not stopping just bc my SIL doesn't want my niece to see it?,"Most nights after dinner, I eat a small ice cream cone. It’s literally the little “joy mini cups” with a teeny scoop of ice cream. Maybe a big scoop if I’m having a rough day but that’s kinda rare. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke weed or do anything “fun” so this is my one fun thing I do for myself. 

My brother and his wife and daughter are staying with me for a few weeks, they’ll be gone by June 15. I’m happy to have them here. Usually we’ll eat dinner together and go our separate ways for the evening. They watch a lot of TV so they’re usually all in the living room watching. 

I’ve been eating my lil cone, but my sister in law approached me and asked me if I could stop. She said that my niece is starting to ask why she doesn’t get to have ice cream and that obviously she was lied to by my sister in law when she told her ice cream is a sometimes food, haha. 

I said that I wasn’t going to stop but I could wait until she was in bed. I figured that was a good compromise and I do get that she’s trying to raise her little girl to have a healthy relationship with food. But waiting until she was in bed didn’t work because she came into the kitchen multiple times to ask me for some. 

My SIL was definitely a little incredulous over it and kept saying “Really? Do you seriously NEED to eat ice cream every single day?” or stuff like it. I said no, but she also doesn’t need to drink a glass of wine every day either. She didn’t like this and sighed a bunch and has been visibly annoyed with me since then. My brother asked me if I could stop just to avoid the drama, but I said I deserve my little treats. AITA?

1kynst0,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not putting away my copy of The Handmaid’s Tale?,"My(20) uncle and cousin(14) are currently staying with us since their house is going through some repairs. Cousin sleeps in my room. Mom told me to put certain books away since they are inappropriate so I put them in a small locked drawer. I didn’t put The Handmaid’s Tale and some of my other dystopian novels there, though. Barely any space left so I had to pick which ones to lock up.

1l542ki,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for not bringing my niece shopping after she was extremely rude/mean to me, even if she “apologized”?","I do not have kids, and I also have not really had a lot of experience dealing with kids before my niece. I don’t have younger siblings or cousins, I never babysat, etc. I’m explaining this because this is my blind spot and why I’m posting.

About a month ago, my niece “Gabby” and I were at the park together. I like to spend time with her and usually take her out to do things just the two of us every couple of weeks. While we were at the park, I was talking about an event I am going to attend with my boyfriend of a few years. She asked to see my dress, so I showed her a pic of me in it.

She made a “yucky” face and said “That’s soooooooo ugly. You look really fat. Isn’t \[\[my boyfriend\]\] gonna think it's bad?”

I was so hurt. She’s only 13! I’m not even a big girl in any sense. I have fat on my body, but I am definitely not fat. 

My sister was surprised and said she would talk to her. A few days later she had Gabby come over to apologize. From my POV, it was not sincere. She was rolling her eyes and looked angry and just got out the words. I told her thank you for apologizing and then told them to leave. I have not gone out my way to spend time with her since.

I had told Gabby that I would take her shopping for the summer and we’d pick out fun stuff together. I look forward to doing things like this with her. Not really anymore. When we were at my mom’s house for mother’s day, Gabby asked me when we would go.

After her stunt I’ve changed my mind. I said that she probably has plenty of summer clothes to wear. She was upset and said “But I said I was sorry!” over and over. 

I told her that I know she said she was sorry but just because someone says they’re sorry to you doesn’t mean that your actions are forgiven. That you have to prove to the other person you won’t do it again, and she hasn’t. 

My mom and sister say I’m expecting adult behavior from a child and that it was ridiculous to cancel the shopping date. I am apparently beefing with a child at my big age. They said that she apologized and hasn’t said anything else rude to me since. They asked how long I’m going to hold it against her. 

I really don’t know how to take this. I trust their judgment most of the time. But this was just an outright mean thing from her. I am worried that as she grows up this behavior will continue and she will turn out to be a bully.

1lk6q45,AmItheAsshole,"WIBTAH if I (F28) told my husband (M28) his ""sleep boundries"" went out the window when he had our son?","Husband (we will call Brad), and I have been together 2.5 years. Had our son in January. Things have been pretty great, but this had me feeling kind of...annoyed?

Brad is diagnosed with autism and ADHD, which can make communication between us challenging at times, but we do our best.

We live in Europe, NOT US.

Since Brad has AuDHD, he only works at 50%, the other half is covered by a health insurance here on a temporary basis, and every few months he has to keep applying for more. It is stressful, as we wait for him to hopefully get on a permanent coverage. Since this is so up in the air, instead of me taking a full year of mat leave, he took a majority of the days in case his temp health insurance is denied for some reason, then he can keep his work schedule at 50% and still get paid on the days he has off.

Which means I went back to work part time. I WFH as a private teacher. I choose my hours, since my students USUALLY live in different countries, I chose some in the afternoon when Brad is home with our son, and at nights, when my students would be awake and Brad is also home. I only have one student in the evening, 23:00 - 23:30 twice a week.

This is to help with some income, and we discussed this before I event went back to work. He had asked no students past midnight. So if Baby is having issues sleeping, he can take care of him and hopefully get him to sleep.

Well, Brad got back on a schedule where he wants to go to bed at 23:00...every night. We try to, but with a baby, sometimes...it just does not happen. Baby sometimes will stay asleep when I put him to bed (I nurse him to sleep), and sometimes he wakes up screaming.

Well, last night I told Brad I had my student at 23:00, and I would try to have Baby sleeping by then. He asked me, ""What is your plan if Baby wakes up? My bedtime is 23:00, so hopefully you have thought of something.""

I said, ""Well, hopefully he stays asleep. If not, you will just have to take care of him, or put him on his play mat and entertain him.""

He resolutely said, ""Bedtime is 23:00, and I will go to bed.""

Come 23:00, Baby is in bed, and Brad is just getting out of the shower. I guess he woke up moments after I started with my student, as when I came out of the office, he was walking around with Baby. I took him, nursed him back to sleep and went to bed also shortly after 23:30.

This morning, he was a bit annoyed with me. When I tried to hug him good-bye as he was leaving to work, he did not hug me back. We always do this before he leaves, so I said, ""Are you upset with me still?""

He replied, ""Yes, you crossed my boundry. My bedtime is 23:00. We disucssed this. I go to bed, and anything past that is your problem to solve if Baby wakes up.""

He left for work...and I was just thinking...what??

I feel I need to have some discussion with Brad about this, but WIBTAH if I told him he has no more boundries with his sleep and he is being ridiculous?

1o11vut,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling my friends husband a useless piece of shit,"My best friend and her husband have 4 kids, 8f, 6f, 4f, and 3f. My friend’s husband is a great dad when someone is there to help. When he’s alone with all 4 kids he gets overwhelmed and freezes. 

A few weeks ago my friend was sick so I brought over dinner. We thought it was just a bad cold. 

When we were eating, my friend went to the bathroom and the 3 year old followed her. 3 year old came running out saying her mom was throwing up. All of the kids ran to the bathroom, followed by me and my friend’s husband. 

I helped her clean up while her husband went to get her nausea medicine and a thermometer. 

When he came back I asked him to get the kids out of the bathroom so she could have some space. After we got the kids out, I took her temp and it came back at almost 104, so I went out to get her some Tylenol and water. I get back and the kids are all in the bathroom again because their dad can’t keep them away from the bathroom for 2 minutes. 

I give her the Tylenol and water and she almost immediately starts to vomit again, then passes out. Her husband just stood there while I was trying to get her into recovery position, get the kids away from her, and call 911. 

I managed to get all of them out of the bathroom and her husband is coming back every 20 seconds asking if I can call their nanny to help with the kids, if I can go to the hospital with her, did I start the dishwasher or does he need to hand wash the youngest’s sippy cup, etc. 

When my friend regained consciousness, he even started asking her how to do bedtime for the little ones, did she wash their pajamas yet, did they get screen time that day or can he put on a movie. I told him his wife couldn’t hold his hand right now and he just had to figure it out. He told me he’s not usually the one that deals with this and he’s trying his best, then goes back to asking what stories the kids like, what setting does he put the sound machine on, and how do they like their milk. I just snapped and told him to figure it out on his own and called him a useless piece of shit. 

It’s been nearly a month and he still acts all pissy when I stop by the house. My friend says he’ll get over it but my boyfriend thinks I was unnecessarily rude and he was trying his best.

1ohv42z,AmItheAsshole,AITA for taking my niece on vacation after her parents planned one without her?,"My niece (11) is the youngest child with 4 older brothers. She’s also the youngest cousin/grandchild and the only girl. Between that and the fact that she was very sick when she was little, she’s a little spoiled by everyone except her parents. 

When she turned 11, she told her mom she wanted to go on a weekend trip with just her and her mom. Her mom made a big deal about her wanting to exclude her dad and brothers. They refused to do the trip and also didn’t plan anything for her birthday so I took her on her trip myself. 

Last month was one of her brothers birthdays. He decided that for his birthday, he wanted everyone to go to Mexico except for my niece. Her parents agreed that it was fair because if she wanted a trip without them, they can get one without her. They asked me if I could watch her for 10 days. 

My niece was so upset so I decided to plan a surprise trip for her. I have some clients in Miami so I arranged for us to go there for 5 days, drive up to Orlando for 3 days, then fly to New York for 2 days, where I also had to get some work done. It was technically a work trip but I was able to plan a lot of fun outings for my niece. 

Just before their trip to Mexico, I told my nieces parents that I had to be in Florida and New York for work during their trip but I could take her with me. Since it was so last minute, they had to agree as they didn’t have any other childcare and couldn’t miss this trip. 

She had a blast. We spent a day in Disney world, went to 2 broadway shows, spent most of our time in Florida on the beach, did a lot of shopping, got room service for the first time, and our tickets were upgraded so we flew first class on our way home. 

Her parents are mad that I spoiled her and undermined them so I don’t get to see her as much as I used to (I’m still their after school childcare so I see her a few days a week) and they’re going around telling extended family that I took their kid across the country without permission because I was upset about her being punished for being rude",15061,0.95,15061,0,15898.0,837.0,1394,1761610482.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ohv42z/aita_for_taking_my_niece_on_vacation_after_her/,False,True
1lbuzuj,AmItheAsshole,AITA for taking unneccesary money out of my daughter's pocket?,"Basically, I have a daughter, Emily (16F) from a previous marriage. My wife Sasha, has a son the same age, Mark (16M). Mark doesn't stay with us that often, he prefers to stay with his bio dad. That being said, when he is here, I find Mark to be a pretty good kid, polite and respectful. 

His dad decided to take a trip for work, in the last few weeks of school, so Mark's here for a bit. He's out of the house most of the time and doesn't take up much space. He does get kind of grumpy when there’s too much going on around him, especially noise, but for that, his favourite thing are these expensive noise-cancelling headphones which he almost always has with him- a present from his dad. 

Emily’s school has already finished, so she's home. The problem is that the room Mark is, sometimes has miscellaneous items put in when he's not here and therefore Emily seems to think its fair game to go through his stuff. I've told her to stop, but Sasha hasn't been taking it seriously, imo, saying that most of Mark's stuff is easy to replace.

The big problem happened when Mark accidentally left his headphones in his room, and Emily accidentally snapped them. 

Mark found out when he came home from school and flipped. He shouted at her, saying she was 'spoilt without anything to back it up', loud enough that my wife and I heard it from the other room. Sasha wanted me to calm things down, which I did- but I also told Emily she’s replacing them.

Thing is, Mark’s dad offered have someone get him a new pair immediately, and that it wasn't a problem. I said Emily would pay him back, and I'm sticking with it. 

Emily and Sasha think that’s unfair since Mark’s dad can afford to buy 10 more. But I don’t think you get to break someone’s stuff and not pay for it. Those aren't the values I was raised with or what I want for my daughter.

That being said, I do realise in this case its kind of unnecessary and there may be better ways for her to make it up to him. AITA? ",14993,0.95,14993,0,15826.0,833.0,1127,1749974372.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lbuzuj/aita_for_taking_unneccesary_money_out_of_my/,False,True
1hva1ju,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for refusing to give up my seat on the plane so a boy could sit next to his father, and to tell the father to behave himself?","Edit: 

I used to read all those posts where people said they didn't expect this to blow up. Well I thought I'd get like a dozen answers. But almost 2 million views in 24 hours is crazy lol. Many people are wondering why I'm insisting on a window seat. I like to look out but mainly if I need a nap that is unlikely to happen if I can't rest my head against the window. Other than that I hate aisle seats a lot, equally if not more than middle seats. People and the drinks trolley keep bumping into you. I don't understand why anyone would choose to sit there. It takes the trolley bumping into you once to change your mind. 

Original post:

So basically I (29M) boarded my short flight (70 min) which has a 2-2 seating arrangement. I had booked myself a window seat and when I got there I saw a maybe 7 year old boy sitting in there, next to his father (about 50 y/o) in the aisle seat. The opposite row also had his mother and his sister sitting there.

Although this happened less than 24h ago I was exhausted so I don't remember the conversation word for word. 

I pointed towards my seat and the father asked me if I would mind swapping so they could sit together, and that their seat is in the row behind it. I said that I would only swap if it is a window seat, and he said it is an aisle seat. Then I said I wouldn't swap and the following conversation happened 


- Him: So do you want to sit next to my son?
- Me: I don't care I just want the window seat.
- Him: *standing up and getting his son up* you are a very nice person. I mean not a very nice person
- Me: It's none of your business and be polite.
- Him: I am not (referring to polite)
- Me: (I said something I don't remember) and behave yourself.

I just stood there looking at him serious, I think he was trying to shame me initially but he didn't respond 
anything else to that.

His wife was watching this the whole time. When somebody in the row behind saw it he offered to swap and sat next to me so they did eventually sit next to each other.

For all I care they could have sat 20 rows apart or even booked a new flight, I had zero investment in this or their reasons. They can ask, I can say no and that should be the end of it imo. 

I didn't like they basically pulled a fait accompli when trying to swap with me. If they care that much they can book their seats in advance like everyone else. I didn't have a good reason why I *need* the window seat except that I like it and don't like the aisle seat lol.

1klbfjk,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my DIL she is not a mother?,"Throwaway

I (64F) have three kids and they are all married. This post is about my son and his wife,Jenny. Jenny struggles with infertility and she has no children. My other son (DIL is expecting next month) and my daughter has recently had a her own kid ( grandson). 

Everyone was busy for Mother’s Day and they couldn’t met up with me for the holiday ( that fine, they are starting their own families). I thought it would be nice to send my expecting DIL/son and my daughter a Mother’s Day basket.

So Jenny always made comments that her two dogs are the first grandkids, I always thought it was a joke. She is big on being a dog mom. My daughter posted a picture of in the group chat of everything she got for Mother’s Day and included the basket. My other DIL also thanked me for her basket in the chat.

Jenny called me soon after and asked where her basket was. I was confused and asked what she ment ( I thought she was pregnant and she was just telling me now). She clarified since I have two grandkids by her already and said her dogs names.  

I was even more confused at this and she clarified that she is her dogs mother and should have gotten a basket. I told her she is not a mother, Mother’s Day is for women that raise human children and not pet owners. She got really upset and cursed me out for not getting her a basket and that she is a parent.

My son is telling me to apologize and to send a Mother’s Day basket over.

1iucy76,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not explicitly stating my punch is non-alcoholic?,"I (25F) recently attended a potluck-style work party, and brought punch, which has since caused a problem between myself and another coworker (42F), who we’ll call Sandy.
Last week, my boss hosted a party at his house to celebrate the end of the busy season, and a job well done. All of my coworkers and their spouses were invited, and we decided it would work well to do a potluck to offset the cost of feeding everyone (about 35 people, since not everyone who came brought a spouse or significant other). I volunteered to make a punch that I’ve brought to previous work events that everyone said they enjoyed, as well as some fruit to go with it. This was a casual party with alcohol present, but since I have some coworkers who don’t drink, I didn’t add any alcohol to this punch, and figured that if people really wanted some they’d just add it themselves. Fast forward a couple hours, and Sandy is getting even louder and more dramatic than normal, and is stumbling around the party. I didn’t think much of it and figured she brought her own drinks, or was adding some of the hosts alcohol that was put out into something else. She suddenly fell off the chair she was sitting on, and made a big show of saying that it’s because she was so drunk- she then asked me, in front of the rest of our coworkers, what it was that I put in the punch. I was confused, and told her what was in it (just a mix of gingerale, 7up, orange juice, and a can of juice concentrate), and she wanted to know what alcohol I put in it, because she’s been drinking it all night, and is “really feeling it”. I told her that I didn’t put any alcohol in it, and asked if maybe someone else had spiked the punch bowl- nobody said they added anything, and one of my coworkers who doesn’t drink even said that they’d also been drinking the punch all evening, and was still completely sober. I also would like to clarify that I understand how context can matter, like if everyone else was really drunk then that can make even a sober person feel like they’re loaded, but that definitely was not the vibe- Sandy was the only person acting “drunk”. She then got really quiet, and went by herself to the bathroom. The rest of my coworkers and I exchanged some awkward glances, and tried to laugh it off. She left shortly after, and I received an angry text from her about how I shouldn’t have embarrassed her like that, and that now she looks like an “idiot” in front of our bosses, and the rest of our coworkers. She’s been hostile to me at work ever since, and is basically refusing to talk to me. I didn’t think I did anything wrong, and most of my coworkers agree with me, but some say that I should have just let her go on thinking that the punch was alcoholic to save her the embarrassment, and I’m wondering now if I’m in the wrong.

1j9oqjf,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my Sister-In-Law to get out of my daughter’s baby shower?,"I (47F) have a daughter (25). She is currently 26 weeks pregnant with her second child (a girl). Her first child, Phillip, was stillborn two years ago at 38 weeks (a little boy). When she lost him, she asked us to take apart the nursery before she got home and “get rid of” the baby equipment (she saved his baby book, his ultrasound photos, and the outfit she planned to bring him home in, along with a lock of his hair in a memory box). 

She’d had a baby shower for Phillip when she was pregnant, but her grief around his death was so strong that she couldn’t handle having the nursery and baby things. We offered to return the baby shower gifts to the givers, most kindly refused and asked us to donate the items… except my husband’s sister, Rachel (43). She made a HUGE deal out of my daughter being “hysterical” and constantly, loudly talked about how “ridiculous” it was to take apart the nursery. We kept her away from my daughter and only allowed her to return to family functions when she promised to stop bringing it up. 

We recently held a baby shower for my daughter’s new baby girl. Rachel (along with the rest of my husband’s female relatives) was invited. She kept making quiet remarks to everyone that we were “tacky” for having a baby shower for a second child, but since she didn’t get near my daughter, I ignored it. When my daughter began opening gifts, it hit the fan. She loudly said “if you hadn’t torn Phillip’s nursery apart and gotten rid of everything, you wouldn’t be here begging for presents for this baby.”

My daughter froze and just stared off into space. Tears started running down her face. I just said “Rachel, please leave.” She refused and started arguing with me. I took her present out of the pile, walked to the door, and threw it out. I yelled “Get out, NOW!!!” and my husband came into the room and asked what happened. His mom told him and he physically picked up his sister and put her down outside the door. 

Now the family is divided over whether I should’ve yelled at her to get out and thrown her present. AITA?

UPDATE: we are having a family meeting (without Rachel) while my daughters and their partners are away at Hot Springs this weekend. Will update again after the meeting. 

UPDATE 2: The meeting went well. My husband and I gave a brief summary of what happened, backed up by witnesses. The relatives that couldn’t make the shower are now aware of what happened. The family consensus is that Rachel is unequivocally to blame and should not be allowed to be around my daughters or their kids. Other people in the family brought up issues they’ve had with her in the past along similar lines (especially involving pregnancy and kids). Rachel will no longer be included in large family gatherings. 

Those who want to continue a relationship with her will do so on their own, and have been informed that advocating for Rachel to be forgiven and included or feeding her information about me, my husband, or our kids and grandchildren will result in us going no contact with them as well. My mother-in-law has apologized profusely for making the remarks about being sad that she won’t have “both of her children” under her roof for the holidays anymore. We have accepted her apology because her feelings are valid and this is sad for her. Thank you so much for all your support.

1maooq9,AmItheAsshole,AITA for “letting” my girlfriend stop coming over in the mornings after my mom’s friend complained about her showering?,"
My girlfriend works 12-hour overnight shifts (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.). After work, she sometimes comes to my place to shower and sleep. She usually arrives around 8:15 a.m., takes a quick shower by 8:30, then crashes for the day.

Here’s where the issue comes in: my mom’s long-term friend (who rents the basement) complained that the sound of the shower at 8:30 a.m. woke him up. My mom passed that complaint along to me and asked if my girlfriend could avoid showering until “everyone is awake.”

I told my girlfriend, and she felt uncomfortable continuing to come over understandably, in my opinion. After working all night, the last thing she wants is to feel like she’s disturbing people just by taking a basic shower before bed. So she decided not to come over in the mornings anymore. She didn’t cause drama or make a scene, just quietly adjusted.

I later told my mom what my girlfriend decided, and she got upset not because of the shower, but because my girlfriend chose to stop coming over in the mornings. My mom insists that wasn’t her intention, but from our perspective, asking someone not to shower after a night shift pretty clearly sends the message that their presence is disruptive.

For context: I also pay rent in this house. My mom’s friend has lived here for years and pays rent too. We all share the space. It’s not like my girlfriend was being loud or unreasonable just taking a 5–10 minute shower in the morning, which seems pretty standard.

Now my mom’s upset with me, but I feel like I handled it fairly. I passed the message along, my girlfriend made a calm and mature decision, and now somehow I’m caught in the middle.

1kijalq,AmItheAsshole,AITA My parents are forcing me to pay for my brothers grad school using money they never told me about,"I've (30F) been financially independent since graduating college. I worked practically full-time while studying, recently paid off my student loans on my own, and just started saving to buy a home. I didn’t apply to grad school because I couldn’t afford it, and my parents made it pretty clear growing up that we needed to stand on our own after high school.

My brother (22M) is honestly a genius. He worked really hard in school, got a full academic ride to a great state school, and graduated with honors. I'm so, so proud of him. The problem now is he recently got into an extremely prestigious grad program that would open a lot of doors for him. He was hoping for scholarships or a paid internship to cover most of it, but it’s not enough. Now he’s facing tuition and housing costs in one of the most expensive cities in the country.

My parents asked if I could help out and suggested I contribute around $15,000 to get him through the first year. They’d match it, and he’d take loans for the rest. I said no. I’ve been working for over a decade on my own goals, and I’m just now starting to save for a house. I don't feel comfortable putting that on hold, especially when I had to turn down opportunities because there was no help available to me.

During the conversation, my mom got frustrated and said they’d be using my “other fund” to help him instead. I asked what she meant, and she said they had set aside about $25,000 for me back when I was in college, meant to be used for a future wedding. I was completely blindsided. I had no idea this fund existed.

I asked why I wasn’t told about it when I was considering grad school, or now while I’m saving for a home. She said it was always intended for a wedding, not school or property, and since I haven’t needed it (I’m not engaged or in a relationship), they decided to give it to my brother because he has a more immediate need.

I'm not going to lie, I was pissed. I never got a chance to make a case for how I could’ve used that money, and now it’s just being handed over to someone else. I told them I felt hurt and left out. My mom said I was being unfair, and that the money was never promised, and if I didn’t want it for a wedding, then it made sense to use it for something meaningful.

My brother told me he didn’t know about the wedding fund either, and he understands why I’d be upset, but said he didn’t ask for it. He just wants to go to school and thought we were all trying to support each other.

1l8ydh2,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not adjusting our China trip to my BIL’s cardio limits?,"**Throwaway:**

I (39M) recently went to China with my sister (36F), her husband (we’ll call him “Doug” 40M), their son (12), my wife and our two kids (11, 9). My sister and I were born in China, but our family immigrated to Dallas when we were young. She stayed there, got married, and had her son, while I settled in the Pacific NW with my wife and two gremlins of our own.

Growing up, our parents emphasized healthy eating and staying active. My sister and I still live that way and pass it to our kids. Doug, however, is… American in every sense of that word. He grew up on ultra-processed foods (Fruit Snacks were considered fruit), and he’ll insist on starting up his Grand Wagoneer for any distance more than three blocks. He’s not TLC immobile, but definitely not built for long treks.

Their son just finished 7th grade and loved the ancient China unit, especially the Terracotta Warriors. My sister thought this the perfect time for him, being half-Chinese, to visit his ancestral homeland. I was already planning a trip to Chongqing to see family, so we added my sister’s family to the itinerary and expanded it to include places like Beijing, Xi’an, and Nanjing to match what their son had learned in school.

I handled most of the planning and tried to hint that a lot of walking would be involved—especially since many Chinese cities have vast transit systems and are less car-dependent. Doug didn’t take it seriously. Once we arrived, it was clear he couldn’t keep up when we explored the landmarks. My sister often stayed behind with him, while my wife and I continued with the kids to ensure we kept up with our tour groups.

It all came to a head in our final stop: my grandmother’s hometown near Chongqing. This place is basically vertical—stairs and steep slopes everywhere. On a particularly hot, humid day, I took the kids to the local market via a park our old family helped build. Doug insisted on coming, saying he didn’t want to sit around all day. I warned it was a long walk, but he insisted.

Half a mile in, he was struggling. I slowed down, but the kids kept running ahead. After we got through the park, I convinced him to take a taxi back while I continued to the market with the kids.

When we returned, Doug was sulking and my sister was upset. She said I was inconsiderate for not just taking a taxi to the market. I explained that would've taken longer given the layout, and the kids wouldn’t have seen the park that was part of our family history. She said she hadn’t realized how physically demanding the trip would be since she let me handle most of the planning and I didn’t consider Doug’s limits.

I agree I could’ve been more considerate of Doug’s cardio, but not at the expense of my nephew and kids experiencing their cultural landmarks—especially since it was my nephew’s first time in his homeland, and my kids’ first time in Xi’an and Beijing. They all said had an amazing and educational experience.

1kp4ekd,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for giving my daughter $60 a week, but my son nothing?","I (45F) have two kids, 17F and 15M. We moved earlier this year to be closer to my parents as my parents health is declining. My daughter was excited about the move, but my son has struggled to adjust.

Due to the move, my job shifted to hybrid, and I needed a work-from-home setup. My bedroom is too small, and the only options were the lounge or one of the kids’ rooms during school hours. I proposed this to them - my son flat-out refused (“no way in hell”), but my daughter offered her room and half-joked about charging me rent for the space.

I thought it was fair, as I get a $20/day work-from-home allowance. I agreed to give it to her if she was okay with me setting up a small office in her room. I work from 8:30 to 5:00, and she usually starts homework right after I finish, so it’s worked out well.

Now the issue: my son is pissed that his sister is getting $60. I don’t do regular allowances, just canteen money (about $10/week) and other needs as they come up. I told him he had the same opportunity and was now shit out of luck. He got angry and brought up the move, saying he never gets to see his friends. (For the record, I drive them back to visit every two weeks for visits) I told him I understood his feelings but said I wouldn’t tolerate being spoken to like shit. He then started an argument with his sister too - going in on her for being an opportunistic bitch and she called him a whiny little asshole.

To cool off, I offered one of them the option to stay at their grandparents for the night - not as a punishment but to break the tension. My son opted to go &amp; while dropping him off, my mom told me I was favoring my daughter and should be paying them equally. My dad disagreed, saying my son had the chance and was shit out of luck.

AITA?

ETA: The conversation took place over the course of the afternoon, and I didn’t immediately agree to the deal with my daughter. I offered it to my son first, who reiterated “hell no” and “get the fuck out of my room”.

I also should mention the reason I have the smallest room is due to the lack of insulation in the ceiling and flooring making it damp, and as we’re heading into winter I wasn’t sending either kid in there. The room also fits a single bed, and a set of drawers - with essentially no other space at all. We own the house in Auckland NZ, and I don’t have the spare cash to get it insulated at the moment (or even fit any of my equipment to work from home in there).",14347,0.86,14347,0,17137.0,2790.0,5958,1747518943.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kp4ekd/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_60_a_week_but_my_son/,False,True
1i42xpy,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my sister her baby isn't a real baby,"I (26F) got engaged to my fiance on January 1st. I was very excited to share with my family of course, and everyone congratulated me and my fiance. I sent a picture of my ring to my family group chat as well as my Instagram and everyone has been commenting on the fact I got a very big diamond. My diamond is a lab grown diamond that is just under 5ct.

 I specifically asked for a lab diamond as I believe they're more ethical, as you never know if a mined diamond is a blood diamond. My sister (31F) was very excited for me but as soon as I showed her my ring her mood changed and she was telling me that it was too flashy and that its not practicical and that it's too trendy and ""not timeless"". My ring is a pear shaped solitare ring with a marquis band and I LOVE it. My sister then told me that there was no way that my fiance could afford my ring (true if it was a mined diamond it would be 10x the price and my fiance is a second year resident) and that I should test to see if it's a real diamond.

 I replied that since it's a lab diamond it was a lot less expensive. She then proceeded to tell me how lab diamonds aren't real diamonds and since they're made in a lab it doesn't hold the same sentimental value. My sister's ring is a small 1ct mined diamond and it's beautiful, I never said anything bad about her ring and it suits her.

 I tried to laugh it off and I told her that I asked for a lab diamond and that I don't want a mined diamond. When I said that she started yelling at me that it wasn't even a real diamond in the first place and that it was grown in a lab not the ground.

 That's when said by her logic, my niece wasn't a real baby then because she was an IVF baby and grown in a lab too. My sister and her husband had a lot of issues conceiving as my sister had some complications with endometriosis. Their IVF journey was really tough and they had multiple rounds and attempts, and one miscarriage but finally got lucky and had my very healthy neice last year. 

I know my sister had a hard time conceiving, that was kind of the point I was making, my niece started in a lab but she has beautiful meaning behind her life too. When I made the comment that my niece wasn't a real baby because she was an IVF baby my sister started crying over the phone. Her husband then called me and berated me and told me I was insensitive and couldn't understand the depths of her emotional turmoil and that I shouldn't have started a fight over a ring. He even said I was ableist??? I have endometriosis too. 

My mom says it's not a big deal but I should let my sister cool off. I usually babysit my niece pretty often but my sister hasn't been answering my calls for a week. My fiance says although I probably shouldn't have said that, I was justified. I didn't mean it seriously, I know my neice is a real baby and I adore her and spoil her all the time. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: I added paragraph and fixed some grammatical errors. Also to update, as of this morning my sister has called me asking for a babysitter. I suspected that this would be why she would call me as I have been babysitting for free when no one else in our family or BIL family will. She apologized that her husband called me and cussed me out but she didn't apologize for her comments, I apologized for what I said as it was insensitive but explained to her that she misunderstood what I meant. 

And to everyone who is confused, I do not think IVF babies are not real babies. Obviously. I was so taken aback that some of you guys read my post and thought that. I said by my SISTER'S OWN LOGIC she thinks her baby isn't a real baby because apparently things can't be real if they're grown in a lab to her. The point I was making was my diamond is real just like her baby is real.",14342,0.92,14342,0,15708.0,1366.0,2889,1737187807.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i42xpy/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_baby_isnt_a_real/,False,True
1m52myo,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my roommate's friend about my heritage?,"I 21F am half Mexican and half Chinese. My parents came to the US before I was born, but thought it was very important for me to learn their native languages and participate in both of their cultures. Because of this, I can speak Spanish and Mandarin. Both of my parents also loved cooking, so growing up we ate a lot of traditional Mexican and Chinese dishes as well as some blended fusion meals as well.

A few nights ago, I was cooking dinner at my apartment. I was making one of those fusion dishes, but I got stuck on a particular step, so I called my mom to ask for help and we talked in Spanish. I was on the phone when my roommate, Ann 23F, came home with her friends, who I was not told were coming over.

Later, one of the guys from the group came into the kitchen and asked what I was making because it smelled  good. I explained the dish was created by my parents to blend Mexican and Chinese cuisine. He then asked why I was speaking on the phone in Spanish earlier, so I told him that I’m half Mexican and half Chinese, and that I grew up speaking both Spanish and Mandarin with my parents. He seemed genuinely interested and asked me more about the languages and the cooking, so we ended up talking for a while about my background and how food and language are such a big part of my life.

The next day, I found out through my other roommate that Ann had told her I was showing off and flirting with her friend. This pissed me off because I wasn't trying to flirt with him and he was the one who started the conversation with me. I tried to talk to Ann about this, but she just seemed annoyed and told me that it was obvious how it looked and I should be more mindful when she has her friends over. I told her that I can't be ""mindful"" if she doesn't even warn me about having company over. She said that she doesn't have to get my permission to invite people to the apartment. I was getting irritated by this point so I let the conversation die down after this.

It's been so awkward ever since this happened and every time I see her she's short with me and barely acknowledges me. I'm starting to wonder if I behaved out of line. AITA?

1iphoz8,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my mom not to babysit anymore when my husband changed his mind?,"My husband is a lawyer and I’m an engineer. We both have intense careers but he wanted a second child. I was happy with our daughter but he really wanted another child. We now have 2 daughters aged (3 and 1) and I came back from maternity leave and my mom took over full time caring for them. We both work full time so she takes them when we work. My mom is a nurse but quit to look after our kids. I insisted we should pay her the going rate for daycares in the area which is around $1500 a child. So we pay $3000 for her to care for our children, cook for them etc. She will also pick them up sometimes as we may need to be in the office early.

My husband complained a lot about how expensive it was to pay her. He makes $140k and I make $110k so we can afford to pay her. But he thinks we are overpaying her and complained about it to her face. My mom is not very confrontational but she got very upset. I argued with him on this for months until I decided it was better for her to go back to work and for us to use daycare. Finding a daycare was hard and now we pay $1800 a child for daycare and daycares obviously will not pickup your children nor will they cook for them. We have less time now and at a higher cost for our children to be sick a lot during the winter season. So far this year we have been sick as an entire household 3 times. I was on a business trip and my husband was late picking up our children which resulted in a $75 late charge which my mom would have not charged extra for. My husband is now demanding that my mom leave her job to go back to babysitting our children but I won’t let her because he did no research into the real cost of childcare and kept complaining how expensive it is even when I showed him. 

My mom even part time makes $4300 a month as a nurse and I told my husband if we want her doing the child care we need to pay her that amount. Remember we already pay $3600 for daycare. He wants her to go back to the $3000 charge and is angry and claims my mom is asking for too much for such a simple job and that a grandma taking care of her grandchildren is a “privilege”. I told her not to quit and him that she isn’t babysitting which reduces his number of free hours and makes our lifestyle harder so he is angry at me for demanding we pay her what I feel she is owed. My mom probably would do it for free if we wanted but I definitely don’t think it’s fair. She needs to save for retirement and she has bills as well. AITA here?

1mfcaue,AmItheAsshole,AITA for taking walks on my lunch break?,"A few years ago I started a job that was more office based than previous jobs. Because of that, I was moving less and gaining some weight and I am very out of shape. I’m not overweight, but I’m carrying a little more fat than I’m used to and I can tell my cardio ability has gone down. 

I get a one hour paid lunch per day. A lot of my coworkers eat at their desk and do a little work, like maybe answering an email. But mostly eating. I personally go to my car to eat and then do laps around the parking garage before I go back in. I am never gone for more than an hour, I am back on time. 

Recently I did my normal routine. I grabbed my lunch, went to my car and ate it, then I started on my walk. I happened to run into a coworker during my walk. He was out there because he forgot needed something from his car. He stopped me and asked what I was doing. I told him I ate my lunch and now I am taking a walk before my lunch break is over. 

He didn’t like that answer and said our lunch break is for eating, not walking, and that when I am done eating, I should go back to work. I told him we are given an hour for lunch, I want to use all of it in the best way I can. 

I think he told other people because then, I’ve been receiving comments before I go on break that I didn’t receive before. I don’t think I was wrong, I’m entitled to my break, all my work gets done on time, I take it at about the same time every day so it’s expected I won’t be available, and I maybe come back to a few non-urgent emails. I have my phone on me in case someone calls for an emergency, which has never happened. 

I talked to my parents about it and they both said they work through lunch and I shouldn’t be out walking. But also they’re older and raised in a different time, so I don’t know if I should trust their judgement. 

So AITA for taking a walk during my lunch break?

ETA: it’s paid. A lot of people think it’s unpaid. I am paid for it. I’m salary. My manager doesn’t have an issue but some people I work with do have an issue knowing I use part of it to walk.

1mc6h9s,AmItheAsshole,AITA for letting my daughter flaunt her expensive items,"I (50F) and my husband (48M) have a daughter, Danica (21F), who has been extremely independent her whole life. Danica began working when she was 15, and now she works part-time for a large corporation while pursuing her studies. We are extremely proud of her and how hard she has worked. We generally allow her to manage her own finances, and she insists on contributing monthly to family expenses with the money she earns. Danica occasionally likes to make pricier purchases, which I do not have any concern over, as I think they are sensible financial choices. Like last year, she decided to purchase the newest MacBook as her old laptop was on its last leg, and she wanted something reliable and long-lasting or when she bought a Marc Jacobs bag for work and university. 

We recently went on a family trip with my brother and his family, who have two kids of their own, Tammy (20F) and Nick (23M). His kids and Danica aren't exactly close, but they get along fine for the most part.  I know that Tammy and Nick do not have any source of income besides my brother and have not worked a day in their life. During the trip, Danica would occasionally pay for the 3 of them for small things like drinks or food. When we were shopping, Danica bought a  few items for herself and picked up gifts she wanted to bring back to her friends. During dinner that night, my sister-in-law (brother's wife) told my husband and me that we were spoiling Danica too much with her purchases. We explained that Danica earned her own money, and every cent came from her job. Sister-in-law then proceeded to point and tell Danica that if that was the case, she shouldn't be flaunting her purchases and items in front of her cousins, who don't have a 'cushy little office job' and parents who 'spoiled her into the person she is'. Danica apologised politely, saying that she didn't mean to flaunt her things, but I could tell that she was upset and embarrassed. My husband stood up and shot back, saying that Danica shouldn't have to apologise for her own hard work. I also pointed out that Danica has been financially independent since she was 15 and that we've always done our best not to spoil her. Sister in Law then proceeded to tell us that we weren't teaching her how to manage her finances correctly and that all this money had turned her into a little 'brat'. Danica excused herself to the bathroom and texted that she had gone back to the hotel. We had a tense back and forth for the rest of the dinner, and we came back to finding Danica crying in her hotel room. I call my brother, hoping that he is able to talk to his wife, but he explained that for the past few days, Tammy had been crying to her parents about not having what Danica had. She had been whining to her mum that she wanted the newest MacBook, as well, but she refused to get it for her.

  
Myself, Danica and my Husband have been getting calls from the rest of the family, some calling us A-holes and some who were willing to hear us out and understand where we were coming from. So AITA?

We realised early on that it was easier for him to use a step stool to reach what he needed in the kitchen than for me to constantly be crouching to get what I need as that gets painful quickly for me.

This was fine, until my MIL came to stay with us two weeks ago. Her roof needs repairs, my husband and I have a spare room while my best friend doesn't so it was only logical she come stay with us. She has constantly been moving things about in the kitchen, lowering items as she doesn't want to use the step stool, which isn't anything to do with her age or fearing she'll fall she just doesn't want to. She keeps harping on about how it's ridiculous everything is so high up and it's rude for guests. My husband has repeatedly shut her down stating my comfort matters more than theoretical guests and asked her not to move things. She lets it go for a day then things are moved again. 

I've expressed frustration to my Husband about this and the final straw came today when I went to make myself a coffee and could not find my coffee mugs anywhere, it took me five minutes to find them in my kitchen and I found them in the lower cabinet that I had to kneel to get them out of. I was angry and snappish at this as my back had hurt from getting my mug, and I told her if she couldn't stop herself from rearranging my kitchen she could get a hotel room as I have had enough of her entitlement. 

This led to a lot of blustering and some tears that she was just trying to make it make more sense and how this is her sons home and how it's just a little reorganisation and that they shouldn't all suffer just because i'm tall, she then also began to say how i'm heartless to expect her to stay in a hotel over the holidays. 

My Husband was clearly uncomfortable at this and didn't want his Mother upset but he told her that it wasn't just his home, but mine too and if she wouldn't respect my comfort and happiness then she would have to leave. She has went into the guest room and I can hear her crying still. My Husband is clearly getting anxious and upset over this but he's not backing down and I feel awful that my snapping led to him feeling like this, maybe I should have just put up with it or been more gentle about how I dealt with it? I honestly don't care that she's upset which may make me sound heartless but I hate that my Husband is feeling this way.",14023,0.97,14023,0,14471.0,448.0,2166,1734616466.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hhtdph/aita_for_telling_my_mil_if_she_keeps_rearranging/,False,True
1l39ygh,AmItheAsshole,AITA for throwing a cup of cold water on my naked husband?,"
My husband has been tested for ADHD, but he doesn't have it. He has the kinds of problems that are associated with ADHD, however.  

He says writing lists, making a schedule, setting alarms, etc, is physically painful for him and he'd rather just deal with ocassional emergencies rather than be proactive.  

The specific problem;  

He often forgets to push the shower diverter valve down. You know, the little rod on the tub faucet that you push down to make water fill the tub, and pull up to make the water come out of the shower?

For nearly twenty. fucking. years. I have been asking him to push that down. Since I was literally a teenager, I have been asking him to push that fucking thing down.

At least twice a month I have a VERY unpleasant wakeup/cold shower, because I turn the water on, and I get a cold spray from the shower. And every fucking time he's apologetic, and then a week or two later, it happens again.

He will do better for a while, and then it slips in again. He is always telling me that he's working on it, and hasn't he been better about it lately? But somehow he's always working on it, always improving, but it never fucking stops.

Today I had just fucking had it. I stepped into the shower, turned it on, and had a very cold and rude awakening. I couldn't fucking take it anymore, I grabbed the cup by the sink and filled it about 3 inches with cold water, and walked out to where he was standing naked (he had just taken off his pajamas and was going to take his shower after mine.)

Without warning, while he was looking down, I held that plastic cup firmly in my hand, and grasping it tightly, I jerked that motherfucker in a 45 degree angle to get that cold water all over his torso and face.

I told him that his apologies were worth the paper they were written on, and I was tired of listening to him congragulate himself for ""getting better"" when I had been asking for twenty fucking years to stop doing this shit. I told him I don't accept his apologies, and the fact that it's an accident does not excuse it. I told him that from now on, every time I'm taking a cold shower, so is he. That I refuse to be a second class citizen in my own home any longer, and if he refuses to make changes to treat me better, I will instead make changes to treat him worse, because I will not tolerate this any longer.

I'm going to continue to surprise throw a cold cup of water on him every time I get a surprise cold shower. I'm tired of fucking *asking/begging for basic fucking respect and not getting it, with the implication that I have to fucking put up with this forever. So reddit, I know I'm probably an asshole... but am I a justified asshole?  

*Edited to add the forgotten words asking/begging  

*Edit to answer the questions everyone is asking;  

Q:  Why don't I just check myself/why do I expect him to leave it the way I want it left?  

A:I don't expect him to leave it the way I want; what I expect is for him to leave things the way he found them. When he walks into the bathroom, it's pushed down. That's how I leave it. So he doesn't get blasted with cold water. But he doesn't leave things the way he found them. Instead, he often leaves the last 10 or 20 percent of a task for me to clean up for him.  

Q: Why don't I leave it the way I found it? Why don't you leave it up if he leaves it up?  
A: If I left things the way I found them, I would live in a sty. I would also spend a great deal of energy making things messier, as I would literally be cleaning up to make space for myself, and then UNDOING that work to put things back as a mess.

Q: Explain your shower to me / why are you getting in before the water is warm?!   
A: Just gonna quote /u/Ciskakid :    

&gt;Folks, you’re misunderstanding her situation. She leans in to turn on the water EXPECTING IT TO COME OUT OF THE SPIGOT. Instead, shower mode is still in place and the water sprays out of the shower and onto her head. It is completely rude of the husband to not switch the water flow back to the spigot when he’s finished showering. This is just basic etiquette.",14006,0.7,14006,0,24511.0,10505.0,11883,1749054334.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l39ygh/aita_for_throwing_a_cup_of_cold_water_on_my_naked/,False,True

I’m single and unmarried and in my 30s. Company HR told my co-worker that her only way to get her vacation is to get one of us who already had our vacation time approved to ‘trade with her’. And considering out of the three of us whose vacations were approved, I am the only female, guess who my co-worker approached for the trade?

She tried explaining (gently at first) that her kids (6 and 4 years of age apparently) were really looking forward to going to Disneyland and that everything is already booked, and if I can give up my vacation spot to her. I told her no, as I too already had my vacation booked (it’s a solo vacation but I’m not about to tell her that). She got real pushy and kept on trying to insist I give her my vacation spot, saying that “My kids would be so disappointed”. I blew up at her after the fourth or fifth time, telling her that her “kids being disappointed” is none of my business.

I didn’t exactly keep my voice down so at least half the office heard, and my co-worker turned red and left. One of my co-workers (25M) who sat to my side who had heard the entire conversation later told me that while he get where I’m coming from, I could be a lot gentler, and “I didn’t get how hard mothers get it”.

1lvjcek,AmItheAsshole,AITA for locking myself in my office when we have company?,"I 36 F took in my mother during the pandemic after some medical issues. I never made her move out after, It works for us, she has her own bedroom and bathroom, we share other spaces and I work from home most of the time so I can look after her. My stepdad died about a decade ago and she was lonely. It made sense for us.

As mentioned I work from home most of the time and a lot of times i'm in some kind of teams meeting or call (yes even those that could be emails but thats not important). So I don't really have time for chitchat during office hours. My mom's sister aka my aunt tends to drop by unannounced to visit with my mom. Which I don't really mind, but she had a tendancy  to step into my office without knocking while i'm working and start talking to me about her neighbors sisters kid who did bla bla bla. I've more than once explained to her that I'm working and or I'm on a call and I can't really chat right now. But she just keeps talking like nothing happened.

Today she actually announced to my mom she was coming over. I reminded my mom to tell her I'm working and on calls and can't be disturbed and my mom agreed she would tell her not to bother me. But just to be safe I locked my office door so she couldn't walk in.

Despite my mom telling her, she came upstairs and tried to open the door, when it didn't open she started knocking and calling out hello it's me open up. I didn't respond at first as I was on a call with a client but she kept banging on the door so loudly I ended up having to put the client on hold. I told her without opening the door I was on a call and could not talk right now and my aunt left in a huff. Now she's bombarding my mom with texts about how rude I was for locking myself in my office knowing I was having company.

So AITA?

Update: Go to dinner for a few hours, return to reddit only to find out this has exploded. First of all thank you all for your confirmation that this isn't on me. I did not think I was the asshole, but there's always that hint of doubt where you're like hmmm maybe I should have poked my head out and said hello real quick, but the truth was it was a busy day today and I just hadn't had the time.

Now for the update: After I finished my workday, I took my mom out for dinner and we discussed the matter. She hadn't responded to any of her sisters (my aunt's) texts because she is fully on my side. I know people are asking why my mom didn't stop her, my mom isn't very mobile anymore and my aunt simply got up from her seat and took off upstairs despite my mom's warning.

We discussed it over dinner and we agreed that my aunt simply is no longer welcome during office hours, since it's the only way to stop this behaviour, either she can pick up my mom to go to a coffee shop and talk, come after office hours, or come over on the one day I work in office. My aunt seems pretty pissy about it, calling their brother (my uncle) to complain also, but he texted me earlier saying he told her how wrong she was and apparantly her husband had also told her she was wrong so now she's currently stomping her feet at home because everybody is saying she's wrong. Delightfull woman she is... remind me to one day post the story about her disneyland trip.

Anyways TLDR: Mom and I decided she's no longer welcome at my house during office hours.

Update to the update: This is the cliffnotes version of the Disneyland story 

She has twin boys, and for their birthday she booked a trip to take them an one of their friends out to disneyland. The friend ended up cancelling last minute and told me if I paid the friends share I could go. Reasonable enough , I figured why not. (I was 16 at the time this story is like 20 years old) I'm european so this is disneyland Paris i'm talking about, and I'm not from France so this is a international trip (this becomes important later) my cousins are maybe 10ish at this point. So anyways we're in the parks and she has been a menace all trip already but i'm dealing with it. It's the last day about 5 hours before we have to take our train back home (international traveling train with customs etc like a plane would be only less boarding time)

One of my cousins wants to go on the rock and roll rollercoaster the other one doesn't. The line is like 5 minutes or less so my aunt tells me to go with him and she'll wait at the exit with our bags. So I leave my bag containing my phone my ID my money EVERYTHING in her care.

Ten minutes later me and my cousin get out of the ride, and she is GONE. So I start looking around, cannot find her, after half an hour of waiting (maybe they went to the bathroom or something) still nothing. We go check the bathrooms, neighboring rides the works no aunt. I have no phone on me to call her, and with us having to leave for the train in 4 hours I get nervous. I'm a 16 year old with a ten year old at my hand and no money no ID no phone nothing.

So I decide to go to the lost kids department and explain my situation. They end up calling her through the parks intercom.. another hour goes by... no Aunt. I remember my dad's phone number back home so I use Disney's land line to call him, he tries calling her cellphone my cellphone no response whatsoever. At this point I have like an hour or less before the train leaves and i'm in hystericals because I can't board this train without money or ID let alone with another minor. My cousin at this point seeing my panic is crying his eyes out so i'm also dealing with a scared child i'm barely an adult myself.

My dad eventually tells me it makes no sense for him to drive out to Paris right now, to go back to our hotel he'll pay for another night and he'll come pick us up in the morning. So I take my cousin back to the hotel explain the situation and the receptionist hears me say my name and says:"" Oh sweetheart I have a note for you"" it's a note from my aunt: Gone to dinner see you on the train...

At this point I have half an hour to run to the station , hoping we'll still get through customs where she's supposed to be waiting. I make it with 15 minutes to spare i'm out of breath, and FUMING. We end up making it through customs god only knows how and manage to get on the train literally as the doors close on us. I call my dad explain the update and he is also fuming at this point. To which my aunt turns to me and goes: I don't know why you're so mad, I left a note at the hotel and I brought you something to eat and hands me a freaking dinner roll..

I took my stuff, went to the dining car with my cousin who she also almost abandonned and gave him the biggest slice of chocolat cake my budget could buy and never came back to our seats to talk to her xD",13907,0.95,13907,0,14680.0,773.0,965,1752069124.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lvjcek/aita_for_locking_myself_in_my_office_when_we_have/,False,True
1k9uirw,AmItheAsshole,AITA for correctly guessing my friend's baby's sex?,"On the weekend my wife (38f) and I (39m) went to our friend's ""gender reveal"". For background information, our friend already has 2 boys, and she told my wife that she is hoping for a girl this time. 

In the car on the way there, my wife asked me what gender I thought the baby would be. I said that given that the sex ratio at birth is about 105 boys for every 100 girls, that my guess is that this child would be a boy. 

My wife said that given our friends had 2 boys already, that surely there would be more chance of a girl this time. I replied that the 2 boys were not relevant to the sex of the child our friends were expecting, and that there was still about a 51% chance this child would be a boy. 

At the ""gender reveal"", it was announced that this child would also be a boy. Although our friend tried to appear happy at the party, it was clear that she was disappointed that this child would not be a girl. My wife also appeared to be disappointed as well. 

On the drive back home, my wife got angry with me, and said that I ""could have been more supportive"" and that I ""shouldn't have been so mathematical"" with my guess about the baby's sex.  
Edited to add: ""could have been supportive"" referred to my guess that the child would be a boy, and my reasoning for that guess. 

I told her that my response was perfectly reasonable to the questions she asked me. She didn't like that and stayed quiet for the rest of the drive home.

1jhkq9l,AmItheAsshole,AITA for agreeing with my daughter it is weird her friend's mom has access to their conversations?,"My daughter is 14 years old and has a friend ""Chloe"". She and Chloe have been friends for a little over a year now. Chloe's mom ""Gina"" is someone I'd consider pretty strict. I was aware she'd check Chloe's phone (and I know a lot of parents do this), but I found out a few months ago through my daughter that she'd respond through Chloe's phone to Chloe's friends, including my daughter. It was never anything overkill, just ""Chloe can't talk right now, she's busy with homework"" or whatever. I thought this was odd but didn't say anything to Gina about it because that's her life and her business. 

I got a call from Gina earlier this afternoon. She was very pissed off and told me that my daughter was rude, I needed to start monitoring what she says, etc. I asked her what exactly happened and she said my daughter gave her an attitude via text. I was still very confused and asked why they were texting. Gina became exasperated and snapped ""Through Chloe's phone!!"" I told her I'd call her back and asked my daughter specifically what happened. My daughter willingly showed me her texts. She had texted Chloe something. Gina had responded (using Chloe's phone) saying Chloe was busy. My daughter replied asking when Chloe would be available to talk. Gina told her ""When she's ready, stop texting her"". My daughter replied ""You don't have to be so rude"". Gina said she wasn't being rude. My daughter said yes, Gina was, and also called her a weirdo for using Chloe's phone. 

I told my daughter next time, just don't engage. I did also say it wasn't kind to call someone a weirdo and not to do it again, but that I also understood her frustration. I didn't punish her, she seemed receptive to the talk and I left it at that. I called Gina back and told her I had spoken to my daughter and handled the problem. Gina started ranting that I need to monitor my daughter's phone and have I seen some of the things she talks about? She started on crushes, rants about teachers, saying there were times my daughter badmouthed me when frustrated. I said that's all fine, I'd rather her have a safe space to vent with her friends, after all, she's a teenager. Gina kept pressing on the issue and what would be done. I told her nothing, I spoke with my daughter and handled it. Gina said ""But she insulted an adult!"" I told her I handled it, but my daughter also didn't say anything that wasn't true, Gina \*was\* acting like a weirdo.

Now, Gina is angry with me, My daughter doesn't care that I said all of this. However, my husband thinks that I shouldn't have said it, as it didn't solve anything, and Gina can parent how she wants. I said I never commented on Gina's parenting, until she tried to undermine/insult mine.

1jqb9l4,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not covering my friend's meal when she ordered more?,"So me and a group of friends went out to eat after midterm. It was a casual places where you pay at the end, and everyone was ordering whatever they wanted.

I got something small as usual because I’m trying to save some cash. So I had water and a basic pasta that was on special. A few others did the same. But one of my friend ordered a appetizer, a big entrée, and dessert, and she got a drink too. No judgment, she can do her, but it definitely added up.

When the check came, she suddenly goes, “Let’s just split it evenly.” I was like, what? I thought we were all paying for what we ordered. She said it would be easier and that it’s “what we always do,” which is not true by the way.

I told her I only brought enough for what I ate, plus a tip. She rolled her eyes and said it’s not that deep, and that I’m being cheap over a few bucks. But it wasn’t a few bucks. It would have almost doubled what I was planning to spend.

I didn’t budge and paid for my stuff only. My other friends didn't care and split the bill evenly.  Now she’s being super passive and told our other friend that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and made her look greedy. But like, she assumed we’d cover part of her extra food without even asking.

1iwn9y6,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my girlfriend I wouldn't make her coffee anymore unless she stops micromanaging me?,"So, for context, I (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for about two years, living together for roughly six months. Normally, we have a good routine: I wake up first, make coffee, and she wakes up to a nice hot cup. Recently, though, she started getting really particular about how she wants it done. She insists on using this super specific method: measure the grounds to the exact gram, pre-warm the mug in the microwave for 30 seconds, add the milk at a certain temperature, and on and on.

At first, I tried to oblige because hey, if she loves coffee that much, I want to make it nice for her. But it got to a point where every time I handed her a cup, she'd grill me: ***“Did you weigh the grounds first?” “Did you warm the mug?” “Is this whole milk or 2%?”*** If anything was off, even by a tiny bit, she'd sigh and say it wasn't as good as “the right way.” One morning, she literally took the mug from me, dumped it down the sink, and started the process herself—while ranting that I *never* do it the right way.

I got frustrated and told her, “If you’re going to be this picky, just make your own coffee. I’m done making something only to be told how it’s ‘wrong’ every time.” She got upset and said I was overreacting, that she just wants her coffee a certain way, and that I should respect her preferences. I argued that I *was* respecting her preference—I just didn’t appreciate the constant criticism or micromanaging. She accused me of being lazy and unaccommodating.

Now, I’m feeling guilty because I do want her to enjoy her morning coffee, but I’m also tired of feeling like I’m a barista under constant scrutiny.

1lrc99k,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my 'friend ' she can yank her child when she has one?,"Title sounds weird I know but I 28F, had a friend 26 F  that I used to hang out with a lot. Recently we got into a accident where someone rear ended me. I had my baby in the car (3 months ), after the crash baby was absolutely hysterical, of course she would be, my friend then tried to scramble in the mix of it to take her out of her carseat. I do admit I may have said it harshly to not remove baby from their carseat until first responders got to us. The car was not on fire and we weren't in any mortal danger. 

On a normal day anytime my baby gets to the point of hysteria I soothe them, hug them, rock them, etc. That was a once in blue moon occurrence I didn't. I kept trying to shush and soothe baby from the seat but obviously she was scared and wanted her mama to hold her. 

At the hospital both my friend and I got the all clear and we were waiting on baby to be cleared, my friend went off on me telling me I'm a bad mom for not removing baby from the carseat. I simply explained to her, it was better for baby to stay in the seat incase there was spinal damage, the seat keeps the spine aligned and removing the baby from the carseat would cause further injury if there was already one. 

She kept berating me, I was frustrated already and I told her when she has her own and god forbid they get into a crash she can yank her kid out of the carseat and do as she pleases. She got quite and said I'm an asshole for bringing it up because she has trouble conceiving, she has PCOS,  and may not be able to carry a pregnancy to term.  

Idt I'm the asshole for bringing up a hypothetical situation or I don't know if my frustration got the best of me and I was insensitive but AITA for making that statement?

1mwvtsi,AmItheAsshole,AITA for banning my wife’s Disney-divorce friend’s plug-ins from our house?,"My wife’s friend Melissa (49f) is staying with us for a few weeks while she sorts her life out. We have a large home and are very happy to have houseguests. She’s leaving her husband after 25 years of marriage because she wants to move to LA and work at Disneyland. This sounds like the plot of a bad sitcom, but I'm afraid it's it’s real. Both she and her husband are equally culpable for the failure of their marriage, and really bring out the worst in one another. Their relationship has been in a state for as long as I've known them.

The problem is Melissa showed up with an arsenal of room scents and sprays, and plugins. The smell (teenage girl with a side of forever chemicals/eau de Disneyland) has completely taken over the the hallway, the family bathroom, my office, and even down two flights of stairs into the foyer drawing room and living room. It’s strong, it's nasty, and it’s made of and smells like, all of the chemicals that we avoid.

Side bar – we've been cleansing ourselves of chemical nasties, and have curated our home to smell clean and subtle, it’s part of what makes it feel like home. Now it just smells like teen spirit.

Melissa is genuinely lovely and in a vulnerable spot, and I don’t want to make her feel unwelcome. But it’s our house, and this is something we’ve been intentional about. However... outside of our personal feelings about plugins it feels really out there to rock up in someone else's home and decide to bring your own plug in scents to totally change the smell of the house.

I mentioned how strong the smell was, assuming it was a room spray, and how it was overtaking every room, she said ""yeah the plug-ins are pretty strong"".  I was so shocked I asked her to remove them. I opened up with a sensitive ask ""hey those room sprays are pretty strong, would you mind keeping the door closed if you're using them"" and spiraled a bit when I heard her say *plugins* (plural).

My wife told me I was being an AH for making her uncomfortable when she is going through a lot, and that I could bitch to her about it was over the line to ask her to stop. I was incredulous that she thought it was okay to change the scent of our house.

Am I the AH here like my wife says? I feel pretty justified in my complaint.

EDIT:

To to address the frequently asked questions.

The plug-ins are already gone, the conversation pivoted from “could you please keep the door closed when you spray the room” to” can you please remove the plugins”. She apologised and removed them immediately.

I also spotted, after writing this post, that the intake vent for the central air was about twelve feet from where one of the plugins was. This explains how the whole house got gunked up so quickly. The smell still hasn’t gone 24 hours later. 

In the part of the conversation where the plugins were revealed my wife informs me that my facial expressions were all over the place, a mix of shock and disgust. I maintained a friendly but firm tone when I asked her to remove them, explained my reasoning clearly. I capped the conversation by saying I hated the smell of them, which was unkind and deeply unhelpful. In my defence genuinely do hate the smell and I was so throughly flabbergasted that an adult would think this is okay to do that I made an unguarded comment.

1kkh3py,AmItheAsshole,AITA for blowing up at my sister for naming her daughter after a fungal infection?,"So my (20M) sister (27F) and her husband had been struggling a LOT with baby names. She was determined to find the single perfect name-- even by the time of her baby shower (nearly five weeks before the due date), she didn't seem any closer to picking something out than she was at the start of her pregnancy.

Anyway, I knew she was struggling, so in addition to the $900 wooden crib on her list that I got for her, I gave her a list of (obviously) joke baby names. We have a really close relationship, and it was in line with both our senses of humor.

She's a nurse, and I'm a biology student, so all the names were medications, infections, unpleasant animals, etcetera, that all sound like lovely girls' names out of context. Some of them were a little bit obscure, sure, but I included some obvious ones like ""Viagra"" and ""Hernia"" for good measure.

Two weeks later, she told me she and her husband had finally settled on a name.

Malassezia. The baby's name is Malassezia. One of the names on my joke list. Outside of the immediate issues (nearly impossible to pronounce on the first try, the ""ass"" smack dab it the middle of it, the first syllable being mal-, literally meaning bad or evil), it's also the name of a very common fungal infection. One that my sister and I are both genetically predisposed to. *One that we've both had multiple times throughout our lives.* Her daughter will almost certainly catch it at some time!

I pointed it out to her, and she said that yes, she knew what it meant, and she knew my list was intended to be a joke, but she just *really* liked the way it sounded. (I don't think the husband knows what it means- I think he'd reject it if he did.) She says that it's so obscure that no one will ever think twice about it. (Except, you know, when little baby Malassezia turns 14, finds a weird spot on her neck, and goes on her phone to google what it is...)

I told her that the name was completely unacceptable, and I was shocked that she chose it. I even suggested some similar names, like Mallory, Azalea, or Anastasia, that would be more acceptable, but she wouldn't hear it! She said that since I'm not one of the parents, I have no business telling her what she can and cannot name her child, and that I'm stepping way out of line. I think it's pregnancy hormones, and she'll regret the decision very soon after her daughter is born.",13325,0.96,13325,0,13904.0,579.0,1170,1747014768.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kkh3py/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_sister_for_naming_her/,False,True
1kxp7ow,AmItheAsshole,AITA for celebrating my birthday without my friends after they rescheduled around babysitters again?,"I've (26F) been part of this friend group since college. We're close and consistently hang out and have friend game nights. The kicker? I'm the only person in the group without kids. Everyone else is busy raising toddlers and infants!

While it seems fair that they've been putting on more and more ""adults only"" events - fancy dinners, wine tastings, and events - great right? Um... no. The adults only events are literally during times that I'm working my restaurant shifts (evenings/weekends) because those are the times their babysitters are available.

I've expressed multiple times that it would be great to have daytime events or meet during the week to do things since my schedule is very flexible during the day. They always say, ""oh we'll try that for the next time"", but it never happens.

Last month was the last straw. My birthday fell on a Sunday, and I asked them if we could do a celebration during the day since I was working that night, and they agreed. Then the day before my celebration the group chat exploded that they were actually now changing it to evening because ""Sarah's babysitter cancelled but can do 7pm instead"".

I was so done at that point. I made my own plans for my birthday with my coworkers who were able to show up and post pictures on social media having the best time at brunch and escaping an escape room.

Now my original friend group is hurt that I ""didn't even tell them"" we changed the plans. They are now calling me petty and that I should understand that finding childcare is hard, but I'm ovèr being the only one who is expected to accommodate everyone else 100% of the time. 

But I think my job counts as an adult responsibility too and I shouldn't have to miss my own birthday for their babysitter problems.

1mux4g3,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not changing my daughter's wedding venue even though my sister's husband proposed to his 22-year-old mistress there last month?,"I (51F) put down a $20K non-refundable deposit on this gorgeous beachfront estate for my daughter , let's call her Amy's (26F), wedding next September. We booked it 18 months out. For context, and without revealing too much, it's THE venue in our area, and it has been Amy's dream wedding spot in all of her pinterest boards.

Last month, my sister -- let's call her Carol (53F) -- found out her cheating ex-husband -- let's call him Mark (55M) -- proposed to his coworker (28F - she was 22 when they started having an affair) who he had been having an affair with. The woman posted engagement photos from the same venue... Specifically the beautiful beach area where Amy plans to have her ceremony.

Carol is obviously destroyed. She called me sobbing, begging me to change venues. Says she can't watch Amy get married where Mark proposed to a girl younger than his own daughter. Can't smile for photos on THAT beach.

I feel sick for her. I do. But:

* $20K non-refundable deposit
* Save-the-dates already sent
* Amy's dreamed of this venue since high school
* Everything else is booked or 3x the price

I told Carol I can't lose $20K and crush Amy's dreams because Mark is trash. Carol says I'm choosing money over her mental health. That I'm forcing her to relive the worst betrayal of her life for ""pretty pictures.""

I also talked to Amy about it and she does not want a venue change. That it's not her fault Mark -- who has been out of all out lives for the last 5 years -- ruined that place for Carol. Carol called Amy a ""spoiled brat who wouldn't understand real pain.""

Now Carol's skipping Thanksgiving. My and carol's side of the family (her daughters and to some extent, my parents) says I'm heartless. The place is cursed anyway, why should we host Amy's big day there.

My husband's side of the family says Carol doesn't get to hijack Amy's wedding because her husband's a cheater.

When this happens, my partner will often interrupt me mid-sentence to ask me to lower my volume. I don’t think they mean it in a rude way, and I understand that they probably just want the conversation to stay at a comfortable volume. That’s fair.

But every time it happens, I feel demoralised, and a little self conscious. I lose my enthusiasm and no longer feel like talking about the thing I was excited about. Even if they don’t mean it harshly, it still feels dismissive and discouraging. I’ve tried to explain how it makes me feel, but they still keep interrupting me.

Am I the asshole for wanting them to stop interrupting me like that? Or do I just need to accept that I should keep my volume in check?

1hrzp8o,AmItheAsshole,AITA? My wife is super pissed off,"I have been married For 5 years with My wife, who I've met nearly 10 years ago.

The thing is, she loves travelling. A Lot. And she loves travelling on the date of her birthday. Last year we went to Maceió, Brazil, and had a great time. In may we had a month long travel to Europe, where we visited some greek island, Athens, a bunch of spanish cities and París.

Her birthday is in a few days and we had some long talks about travelling. Europe left us in debt, and some health issues left us with almost no savings. Alse, we want to have children this year and we need some medical assistance For that, that also costs money. I told her that, maybe this year we cannot aford to travel anywhere, she didn't like it but she agreed.

But it turns out a few days ago, she snapped. She is now super angry because she is staying Home For her birthday, that it doesn't matter what we discussed, she never said she don't wanna travel and that me, as her husband, should know what she wants For her birthday and should have know that she wanted to travel either way and surprised her with some tickets.

I really don't know how to defuse the situation. I offered to Buy some last minute tickets anywhere but now she doesn't want because she said I'd just be doing it because she forced me.

We just started dating a few months ago and I love him, but I eat everything and am very laid back.  I know I will have to plan my entire day around finding food he can eat, on top of listening to him complain that things aren't the same.

1k0njqz,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting my coworker stay at my place even though I “have the space”,"so I (23f) live alone in a small 2 bedroom house. one room is mine, the other one is basically my everything room. It’s my office, my closet, storage, sometimes i just lay on the floor in there and stare at the ceiling when life sucks lol. it is NOT a guest room. I’ve lived with horrible roommates before so I worked really hard to be able to afford my own place and I love having my space. it’s literally my safe little bubble.
anyways, one of my coworkers (25f) got into a huge fight with her roommates and they kicked her out. she was venting at work and i felt bad and was like “that sucks omg” and even sent her a few places to look at. I was trying to be helpful without inviting chaos into my life yk?

later that night she texts me saying “hey I was thinking maybe I could just crash with you for a few weeks since you live alone and have the space?”

i literally got that sinking feeling in my chest. nooo. no no no. i’m not even close to her. we’re cool at work but we’ve never even hung out outside of lunch breaks and complaining about our boss. she doesn’t know anything about me. and i don’t know her like that. why would she live in my HOUSE.

so i replied super politely like “i totally get that you’re going through it but i really value my space and I’m just not in a place where I can have someone stay with me” like i was NICE. didn’t ghost her. didn’t ignore her. just said no.

next day she’s acting really weird. then another coworker tells me she said i “let her be homeless” when i “have an entire room to myself.” like GIRL. first of all, she’s staying at her bf’s place. second of all, I pay to live alone. that’s the whole POINT. I don’t wanna feel tense or uncomfortable in my own space. I don’t wanna tiptoe around a person I barely know. and I definitely don’t wanna deal with “just a few weeks” turning into “i’m looking but nothing’s coming through yet” for 2 months.

now ppl at work are acting like I’m the bad guy. sorry for not letting a coworker move into my apartment bc she had a bad fight? idk. i feel bad but like. also no.

Aita??

she went to jail, lol. Don’t know what happened but I feel horrible to say I laughed. Well, solves that issue.

Last weekend, while we were away, he invited his female friend (Sarah) to stay over. When we got back, I noticed she had used most of my shampoo and conditioner without asking.

Today, Sarah came over again for a visit and asked to shower at ours before heading to a dance class. However, I had taken my expensive products to my room this time, leaving only my friend’s basic shampoo out for her to use. When she couldn’t find the conditioner, she asked my friend, who came to my room to ask me about it. I told him that she’s his guest, and it’s not my responsibility to provide spa products for her.

1nbq3wr,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling my boyfriend an idiot because he won’t get a colonoscopy even though his mom had colon cancer?,"So my boyfriend (33M) has a family history of colorectal cancer. His mom was diagnosed in her early 40s and it was really bad. She survived, but it was a long, awful ordeal. He was old enough to remember it.

Because of that, his doctor told him he should start colonoscopies earlier than most people. He’s technically overdue for his first one. And lately, he’s had some weird stomach problems.

I’ve been telling him for a year to get it checked out. He keeps saying things like, “It’s embarrassing,” “I’m too young,” “What if they find something bad?” Like … yes, that’s the point of the test??

The other night, we got into it because he mentioned again that his stomach has been bothering him. I told him point-blank: “You’re being an idiot. Your mom went through hell with this and you’re ignoring your chance to be healthy.” I also said that if he won’t take care of himself, I don’t know if I can plan a long-term future with him because I don’t want to lose a partner to something that could have been caught early.

He got really upset and accused me of being controlling and dramatic. Now he’s barely speaking to me.

I feel like I was harsh, but honestly? I’m scared. The news has story after story of people dying from this because they ignored it too long. People his age, too. I’d rather him be mad at me than bury him in ten years.

1hvj7vh,AmItheAsshole,AITA for Ruining My Family’s New Year’s Eve by Refusing to “Join the Fun” Because I Didn’t Want to Be the DD Again?,"Hey Reddit, I (26F) need some serious perspective. I’m starting to think I might be the asshole, but I still feel like I’m in the right lol.

Every New Year’s Eve, my family has a big party at my aunt and uncle’s house and every year, without fail, I end up being the DD. Don’t get me wrong I love my family, but it’s starting to bug me. It’s been like this since I was 19, even before I was legally allowed to drink.

I don’t drink much—maybe a glass of wine or a beer, but I don’t get plastered. I’m fine with driving people home if they need it, but for the past few years, everyone expects me to not drink so I can drive them back. Every year, it’s the same: “Oh, can you drive? You’re not drinking anyway!” I always say yes because I don’t want to let anyone down.

Fast forward to this year’s New Year’s Eve. I told my family ahead of time I wasn’t going to be the DD anymore. I just wanted to enjoy the night, have a couple of drinks, and not be responsible for getting everyone home. I even told my cousin who usually gets really sloshed that I wasn’t driving this year, and she was fine with it.

When I got to the party, it was the usual chaos. People were drinking, laughing, and having a good time. I was enjoying myself, but around 11, my cousin came over and asked if I was ready to drive everyone home. I reminded her I’m not driving tonight, I’m here to enjoy the party. She looked at me like I was crazy and said, “Come on, you always drive! Don’t be a bitch.” Which like, wtf?

I tried to explain calmly that I wasn’t being a bitch, just that I wasn’t going to be the chauffeur anymore. Then, my aunt overheard and pulled me aside. She lectured me, saying, “We all agreed last year you’d be driving. You know how much we rely on you. Everyone else is too tipsy, and Ubering is so unsafe. Just drive this one time, for the family.”

I felt a ton of pressure but refused I told her I’m not their chaufeur and wasn’t going to do it again just because no one else could figure out their own ride. My aunt got upset, saying I was being selfish and that we’re family. She said I’m the only one who doesn’t get ‘too drunk,’ so it makes sense for me to help out. I told her I had already had three beers, so I wasn’t even legally supposed to drive myself.

That’s when I snapped. I told them it’s not my job to be their DD every year just because I’m the only one who doesn’t get blackout drunk. They needed to figure out their own rides this time. Then I got up and left. I felt bad walking out, but I didn’t want to be a doormat anymore.

I spent the rest of New Year’s Eve at home, watching Netflix and eating leftover pasta with my boyfriend. My family texted me, calling me dramatic, selfish, and saying I ruined the night. They said I was being “super sensitive” and that everyone was “disapointed” in me. Everyone's demanding an apology out of me even now.

And by the way, I got home perfectly safe by Uber. But anyways, Reddit, AITA?",12982,0.98,12982,0,13252.0,270.0,749,1736223625.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hvj7vh/aita_for_ruining_my_familys_new_years_eve_by/,False,True
1hlmoze,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my coworker why customers might not like her,"I work at a restaurant as a server. One of my coworkers moved up here from Georgia for college and started working here a few months ago.

She constantly lays on the “southern charm” thing thick. She calls everyone “honey” and “sweetie” and all of that. She also tends to chit chat with people instead of just letting them eat after bringing them their food or drinks. It’s also kind of obvious that a lot of them don’t want to really talk to her, they give one word answers and she just barrels forward and talks at them.  (Management has told her off more than once for this) 

About two weeks ago she was upset because a customer yelled at her and said “Don’t call me that!” when she called her “honey” and she complains that she’s not getting as many tips as the other servers. She says it’s because she has a southern accent and customers think she’s stupid, but I don’t think that’s the case. 

She asked me for advice, and I said it’s because she takes so long to bring things out and wastes time trying to make small talk. I also said that the excessive pet names sound kind of condescending, and they aren’t really something you would call a stranger here. 

She told me that she wasn’t going to start being rude to customers because she would make even less money. I told her it’s not being rude, it’s just how things work here, and it’s rude to other customers she’s supposed to be serving when she spends all her time trying to make small talk instead of doing her job and calling them weird things. 

Now she’s mad and has been avoiding me. Maybe I could have been gentler when trying to explain why people complain about her, but I was also really stressed because it’s Christmas season and so much is going on  AITA?

1kss1b7,AmItheAsshole,UPDATE: AITA for refusing to go to my sisters wedding after finding out only our side of the family were having to pay to attend?,"
 I had a lot of messages at the time of posting, asking for an update on what I decided to do so wanted to check in. 

So in short I didn’t end up going to the wedding. Katie and Chris basically harassed me constantly until few days before they were due to fly out I received a belligerent voicemail from Katie saying if I didn’t go I wasn’t her sister any more, I was embarrassing myself and her and Chris, I was a horrible person, and most shockingly if I didn’t go then her and Chris wouldn’t be paying me OR my parents back for the money we loaned (so trying to. blackmail me), she would say it was a gift, I faked the contract and I would have to take her to court. She was clearly drunk at the time (the voicemail was left on the night she was having her “at home” hen do, which I also obviously didn’t attend) but it was so beyond anything I thought she was capable of. I ended up sharing it with my parents and they also reluctantly pulled out of attending. 

I heard through friends and family in attendance at the wedding after her and Chris were telling everyone I had alienated her from her family and told lies to our parents, we gifted money and expected them to pay for us etc etc and they made the decision to uninvite myself and my husband… 

Other, more insulting things were said that I don’t particularly want to go into - suffice to say they were very hurtful. 

As I mentioned in my post I had my brother in law (solicitor) draw up a contract for repayment for both myself and my parents. What was supposed to be the first repayment date passed without word from either of them, so BIL picked up from there. His attempts to reach them were ignored apart from 1 email from what I think was a fake law firm outlining the money was “gifted”, the contract was fraudulent and to take them to court basically. In response to that BIL sent a copy of the voicemail Katie left and a final demand outlining the payment plan was now null and void and we wanted the money in full within 30 days or we would indeed be going to court. Magically the full amount appeared in our accounts 5 days later. 

Again I’ve heard on the grape vine since the wedding they have been telling anyone who would listen we asked for our “gift” back out of the blue and disowned them and how much of a difficult financial position they are in because of this. 

So that’s that… I can’t see myself having a relationship with her after this which is devastating but at the same time, I truly believe now after everything that, that isn’t my fault. 

Thanks again to everyone who gave advice - I hope this update is enough for everyone who asked for one :) 

EDIT: thanks everyone: I’m popping the original post here for a few people who have asked for it. I did put it in a comment and a few replies but it looks like it might have gotten lost.

1ibaeno,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for refusing to take my daughter to ""her"" birthday party?","My (33F) daughter “Cleo” (5yo) hates pink. She has disliked the color and almost everything to do with it since she was about three or so. She has one pink shirt she likes and one pink stuffed animal, and that’s it.

My father’s partner, “Prue,” refuses to accept that Cleo doesn’t like pink. Over the years, she’s made several attempts to push the color onto her (pretty much every gift she’s ever given her was some shade of pink), no matter how many times I tell her to stop. She has tried to give me dozens of different reasons why I should encourage my daughter to “try different shades.” It clearly upsets Cleo, but Prue keeps doing it.

About a week ago, my father invited me, my husband and our children for dinner at his place. He said he and Prue had a surprise for the kids.

Right before we left home, my younger sister (who still lives with our father) texted me. She warned me that the “surprise” was actually a small birthday party Prue had planned for Cleo. That alone threw me off, because my daughter’s birthday was in November. My father did miss her actual birthday party due to work, but still. Also, my son turns 9 in March, so I had figured his would be the next party we’d have.

Then she sent me photos of how the place was decorated, and it very clearly wasn’t actually meant for Cleo. Literally every piece of decor was pink. The table, the tableware, the balloons, everything. She had gotten pink banners and glued pink foil fringe curtains on the doors. Even the cake was pink.

I showed everything to my husband, and we agreed not to take the kids there. I texted my father the following: “Hey, (sister) told me everything. We’re not coming. We’re taking the kids to McDonalds and telling them that was your surprise. You and Prue can come if you want, we’re paying.”

We did exactly that. My father did show up (without Prue), but he was cold with us and left 20 minutes after arriving.

Both him and Prue are pissed. My father is angry that my husband and I dismissed his partner’s “heartfelt gesture” towards our daughter. Prue also told me that I’m the reason Cleo is “restrictive” (I also don’t like pink), and I’m raising her to be an ungrateful, spoiled brat who is unwilling to compromise.

To be honest, I get how I could be in the wrong here. But at the same time, this just felt like Prue trying to push something Cleo doesn’t like onto her yet again.

My sister and one of my brothers are on my side (though my sister did say I had been rude). My other brother is on the fence.

1l5lmnc,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for not cooking ""fancier"" meals?","I'm the only one who cooks in our house. It's just 4 of us, my husband, me and my daughter and little brother. My husband is 27 and I'm 25.

My husband barely knows how to make eggs, even though I've tried to talk to him constantly about learning how to cook. My daughter and brother are still in elementary school so they only help me cook.

The responsibility falls on me and it's honestly exhausting.. so, I just set up a system in my head. It's easy, for breakfast It's just something with eggs or cereal. Lunch is some sort of sandwich, burger, or leftovers. Dinner is the meal I usually plan but I have like 10 dishes I repeat. Sometimes I'll go off, especially Sunday, but generally I stay because it's easier for me mentally.

Well, one day I made just pasta alfredo with chicken and as we were eating, my husband mentions that it would be nice if I made ""fancier"" dishes. I asked him what he meant and he explained he wants me to change things up, add some more meat dishes and variety.

Next time, we went out shopping and i was putting ingredients I don't usually buy into the cart. As the ingredients started piling up, my husband was getting all puffy and upset. We got to the meat aisle and I started picking out beef and that's when my husband lost it and started taking things out of the cart. Saying that we can't afford my ""fancy living"". I blinked at him and tried to explain that he was the one who asked for variety and different dishes, so I'm buying different ingredients. 

He rolled his eyes and told me that I'm being dramatic. I just let him do his thing, taking out most of the ingredients out. 

The next week, I made the same dishes because that's all I had ingredients for. A week passed and my husband was all pouting that I made fried rice again and that he's sick of chicken. When I pointed out that he took out all the beef out of our cart, he blew up on me again and said I'm being an asshole because he doesn't know how to cook?

1in3ko0,AmItheAsshole,AITA for blowing up at my sick husband when he asked for help with our toddler?,"I plan on sending this post to my husband once the verdict is in, whichever way it goes, so I’ll add as much of his perspective as I can.

Our toddler was sick through the weekend. I was up with him one night from 12:15-2:45, and off and on the next night. I probably got 10-12 hours of broken sleep the whole weekend.

Yesterday, my husband mentioned he was starting to feel a little sick. Last night I went to bed early hoping to catch up on rest. All throughout the night, my husband woke me up way more often than my toddler ever does, even on a bad night. Some of the times were not directly his fault, but other times I felt like he was being inconsiderate.

1: He snored loudly in my ear. 
2: He asked for another blanket because he had the chills. I told him it was at the foot of the bed. He asked for help and reminded me that he helps me when I’m sick, and that he’d still do the morning routine with our son.
3: He had a nightmare I had to shake him awake from. (normal)
4: He whispered at Alexa to ask for the time.
5: He asked for another blanket. I gave him mine.
6: He made a phone call (in bed) and left a full volume voicemail to his work to let them know he’d need to take a sick day.
7: At 5:30 in the morning, he woke me to ask if I could do the wake up routine with our son. (I do bedtime, he does wake up.)

At this point I blew up. I expressed how mad I was that he woke me up all night long, and now I have to wake up early to do what he said he’d still do, and I don’t get to stay home and catch up on sleep. He said I was in the wrong because marriage is in sickness and in health. I immediately got up to get ready. He said I didn’t have to start getting ready so early, I said yes I did because I start work at 7:30. I barely make it to work on time when I wake up at 6:00, and now I have to unexpectedly skip my shower, get my toddler ready, get his food ready for the day, feed him breakfast, drop him off at daycare, then take myself to work.

I said he was a grown man with a cold, and he robbed me of the rest I needed, and that I’ll be sleeping on the couch tonight. At that point I asked for space and we haven’t talked since. I was late for work which is a big deal at my job.

I might be the asshole for blowing up at my husband when he asked for support during an unexpected illness. Am I the asshole for being mad at my sick husband?

1nx9k3x,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a woman to charge a guy more at a yard sale.,"I was shopping around our city’s yard sales yesterday and stopped to look through some clothes. While I was looking a guy walked up and asked the old lady running the sale if she had anything golf related. My ears perked up because I have just recently gotten into golf. The lady said she had her late husband’s clubs but didn’t know what they would be worth so she dragged them out to show the guy. It was obvious the guy knew golf by the way he took a couple practice swings and you could tell by his car and clothing he appeared to be well off. As he looked around the bag the lady was telling him that her husband had just passed and that she didn’t know if the clubs were worth anything. He said they weren’t that great and offered $200 for everything. She seemed hesitant and said she didn’t know and he just kind of talked over her and said “here I’ll go grab the money” and walked towards his car. I walked over to see what was in the bag and for anyone who knows golf I’ll throw this out there. 

Almost new GT3 driver and 3 wood 
Gently used mizuno Irons
Nice titlest wedges 
A very nice looking Scotty putter
Great condition titelist cart bag

This stuff combined would be a steal at 1k. 
Obviously this ladies late husband had spent a good penny on the clubs and I felt bad for her so I told her she should pass on that guys offer and have someone at a local course’s pro shop help her price the stuff out to sell if she wanted. She seemed totally shocked when I told her the driver and 3 wood were probably worth 800 alone. When the guy came back he was glaring at me and when he tried to hand the lady the cash she said no thanks and that she was going to get the stuff appraised. He got upset and told her she can’t back out of a deal so I chimed in that they didn’t really make a deal. He got pissed at me and told me I needed mind my business. The lady then told him she wasn’t interested again and to please leave. He walked to the e d of the driveway and just stood there angry like my toddler would. Before he walked away he called me an asshole and stomped off. 

The whole thing was more funny than anything to me. 

I was telling this story to my coworkers today and they were all dogging on me saying I should have kept my mouth shut and let the guy get the good deal but it felt wrong letting him rip her off. So am I the asshole here?

1hltmaz,AmItheAsshole,AITA for getting engaged after my brother’s wedding?,"EDIT: paraphrased some direct quotes and removed some potentially identifiable info. 

My brother and his now wife got married three days ago. A very small destination ceremony under 15 people total. My now fiancé and I extended our trip after everyone went home and spent a couple of days exploring the Grand Canyon, a couple hours north of the wedding, where he proposed. 

When I shared the news with my brother and now SIL, he responded with hostility saying that it looked like we were competing.

I apologized, quickly realizing that he was advocating for my SIL and that she felt hurt (although I’m truly failing to understand why). I also texted her a separate apology and explained that it was not our intent to encroach and just wanted to share the news with family and that it’s my belief that there’s room for happiness for everyone. She did not respond. 

In response to my apology, my brother doubled down and said the timing and location were hurtful and that we shouldn’t planned around the wedding.",12495,0.98,12495,0,12755.0,260.0,35,1735100679.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hltmaz/aita_for_getting_engaged_after_my_brothers_wedding/,False,True
1hccgwm,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my friend she shouldn't have chosen her sperm donor? ,"My (28F) friends (32F &amp; 32F) are having their fourth baby. Let's call them Allison and Jenna. They have three daughters already (10, 7, 5) that were birthed by Allison when she was married to her now ex husband. They decided they wanted to have a fourth because Jenna would like to have another baby and carry the baby. They chose to do a sperm donor through a fertility clinic. It's one of those ones where you flip through a book and pick out the donor based on your chosen criteria, like height, hair color, hobbies, etc. The sperm donor they chose is a black man. Allison, Jenna and all three of their daughters are fully white. I told them that they made a mistake choosing that particular donor and should have chosen a white donor. I told them I feel as though they are doing a disservice to their future child. They will look different than all of their siblings and grow up completely away from any sort of black culture and have no black relatives. They told me I was being racist and that mixed babies are cute. My issue isn't with mixed babies, my issue is that two white women chose to have a mixed baby knowing what obstacles she will face and that neither of them will be able to relate to her. Yes, I know they face discrimination as lesbians but I don't think that's the same as what black people deal with. Am I the asshole for telling her she shouldve chosen a different sperm donor?

1lkjvjf,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking why they ignored the no dog sign.,"I (33M) went to a coffee shop this past weekend. As soon as I open the door I'm hit with a dog looking at me at hip level sitting on a chari n this small shop.  The dog is indoors and the door had a clear no pets sign.  I watched for a second, this clearly wasn't a service animal as she was letting it interact with several other guests.   

I asked her why she ignored the no pets sign?  She ignores me.  I asked her did you miss the no pets sign?  She immediately says I think you should stop harassing me.   All I was doing was asking why she ignored the no pets sign.  This lady played the victim and called me an asshole.   

Another patron steps up for her and the dude says why's it an issue? Who cares?   Tells me don't be an asshole and drop it. I wave the guy off, tell him I care, and I don't like dogs.  I say it's not hard to not bring your dog to a coffee shop that doesn't allow dogs.  By that point it's my time to order, I complained to the employee who didn't seem interested in enforcing anything. The owner left on her own.  AITA?

1os46ue,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my sister in law what she's doing with her degree after she implied my university wasn't prestigious enough,"Last night my husband, our 2 year old daughter and I were at my in-laws. My sister-in-law and her husband and kids were there too. The topic of one of their cousin's kids going to university came up. We talked about how going to a good university helps in networking. I mentioned how I had gotten my first Business Analyst job because my interviewer had also gone to UofT. At this point my SIL chimed in with ""UofT Mississauga right? So not the actual one?""

My husband said politely that its the same thing and she just shrugged. I asked her where she went, she said she went to UofT and added St.George Campus. I then asked how she's using her degree (I knew shes a SAHM so thats why Im here that might have been an AH thing to say). She said she chose to be a SAHM mom and kind of stopped talking to me.

My husband thinks I was out of line. Admittedly I didn't think it through when I said it, just said what came to my mind. He says her question was tactless but not malicious. I said it was rude and thats what mattered. And the premise of it was just wrong. But I have been reconsidering it. She has texted him about how out of line I was. He's told her it was a misunderstanding between everyone and to let it go. 

AITA?

Update:

I was heartened by all the NTA votes. I read a lot of the comments and really appreciated those saying I wasn't the instigator so I was in the clear. As I read more comments and the way my SIL was being mentioned, it made me feel bad. I don't blame the comments they were only going by the context I had provided. But I took the fact that my SIL being criticized heavily was making me uneasy, as a cue to mend the relationship. She isnt a bad person, her and I aren't bffs but have always been cordial to each other.

The NTA verdict had given me the peace of mind that my reply wasn't totally uncalled for. So I asked my husband if she was still messaging him. He said she'd just sent a final wall of text of how hurt she was and then gone quiet. I asked him what he thought he said he'd told her that her remark was thoughtless. But told me that there's levels to this, my reply really cut her. I told him I was willing to apologize if she did too.

Last night I got a call from her. She said that she had realized that her comment about UTM had come across as insulting and that was not her intention. She said she was really proud of me and my career and the way I juggled it with being a mother and apologized for her remark. I thanked her and said my comment about her degree was out of line. That shes an awesome mother and my remark had zero thought behind it, it was just me saying whatever I could in the moment. She broke down a bit, and that honestly made me feel terrible. I teared up too and we just agreed to put this behind us.

Like I mentioned in my original post my reply was instinctive. I don't think she's wasting her degree and I hope her comment had equally no thought behind it. But I'm glad I patched it up with her.",12396,0.94,12396,0,13241.0,845.0,1392,1762645514.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1os46ue/aita_for_asking_my_sister_in_law_what_shes_doing/,False,True
1j8hml5,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my friend that I was done inviting her to parties?,"I, (22-F) throw a lot of dinner parties (like a ton). I LOVE to cook, so I always put food on the table and I'm a pretty good chef I'd say. One of my friends comes to all of them. The problem is? She takes all the leftovers. Istg, every single time that there's a scrap left, she takes it. And I appreciate that she doesn't wanna waste food. That's not the problem. The problem is: I want some leftovers, too! So, I told her when we were eating this time, hey, ""don't take the leftovers, ok?"" And she was like, ""yeah, sounds good.""   
  
Fast forward to the end of party. She takes the god damn leftovers. When I notice later that night, I text her ""hey if you can't stop taking the leftovers, I'm not gonna invite you anymore."" She says ok.   
  
Next time that she comes over for a party, I remind her when we're eating, don't take the leftovers. She says okay. When she's about to leave, I was sitting near the table. Guess what I see: SHE'S TAKING THE LEFTOVERS. So I tell her that if she couldn't listen to a boundary I set, the clear consequence that I discussed with her was that she would not be invited to any more parties. She said that it wasn't fair that she couldn't have some, and she was only taking a bit this time. I'm not sure if that's true but I told her I didn't want her to take any. She says okay and puts them back.   
  
Fast forward to next time I hosted a party. She isn't invited. Apparently she found out through the grape vine (makes sense, we share quite a few friends) and she got pissed as hell, saying that she put them back and I should have invited her again.

1kvd1su,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for posting screenshots of my SIL's texts online and ""making her look bad""?","I (29F) and my wife (28F) had our sons six days ago, the pregnancy was complicated and they had TTTS (Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome) which resulted in them coming early. They are currently in the Neonatal Unit and my wife and I practically live there so we can spend time with our boys. 

My brother and his wife got married two days ago, I didn't want to leave my sons or my wife so I missed the wedding though I sent them their gift from us and a text wishing them a fantastic day and I thought nothing more of it. Yesterday I got a text from my new sister in law explaining that because my wife and I missed the wedding she'd need us to send her £140 for our plates of food. I asked her if she was joking and she told me that she got my wife couldn't go as she had to stay in the hospital but that I wasn't the one who gave birth so I could have went and saved two plates of food from going to waste.

I told her she was being ridiculous and asked if my brother was aware she was asking his sister for money for food, she brushed that off and said weddings were expensive and she had to try and recoup her losses and this should be between us ""woman to woman"". Between this and her thinking I should have gone anyway I admit I lost my temper. I ended up taking screenshots of the conversation and posting it to facebook.

This shocked several people in the family and she must have gotten bombarded with messages as she told me to take it down, as I was making her look bad and people were taking it out of context and thinking she was some kind of villain. My brother called me and told me not to worry about the money that it was stupid to expect us to pay for the plates though asked me to take the post down and he'd handle it. He seemed kind of shocked by her even asking this.

Did I go too far? My wife is mostly upset by our sil's comment about how I wasn't the one to give birth, as if it makes me less of their mother. Maybe I should have handled it better but I admit at the time I wasn't thinking very clearly.

1n5gnbk,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not changing my annual backyard party plans for my boyfriend and his kids?,"I (42F) have been hosting an end-of-summer party with my neighbors for years. It’s always the same setup: adults and kids come, we all celebrate together, and at some point the kids go to sleep while the adults continue the evening.

This year’s plan was the same: I was going to bring my kids (6 &amp; 10yo) inside to sleep at our home which is right next to the backyard. From the balcony there is both audio and visual access to the yard, and my kids also have a phone they can use to call me if needed. After putting them to bed I planned to go back to the backyard for a little while longer to enjoy the evening with friends.

I invited my boyfriend of 6 months (46M) and his kids (5 &amp; 7yo) to join us. He declined, saying he didn’t feel comfortable leaving his kids to sleep at my place since they hadn’t stayed there before. He also didn’t like the idea of putting them to bed at my place while he stayed outside with me, or going to bed with them while I stayed outside.

I told him I understood completely, and I didn’t have a problem with him choosing not to come. But then he got upset and said that he and his kids weren’t actually welcome at the party because of the way the party was set up. I explained that this party has been running for years with the same format, and it’s not really something I can or want to change for one guest. My view is that guests can decide if the event works for them, and if not, they don’t have to come. In his opinion I should have left the party with him and our kids when it was bedtime.

On top of that, during the party I didn’t have time to call him because I wanted to focus on my guests and enjoy the evening. He was very hurt by this too, saying I should have made time.

This all turned into a big argument.

1is68j3,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for avoiding my mom after she told me to ""suck it up"" when I broke my fingers","I was at the gym where a heavy-weight fell onto three of the fingers on my left hand. I was in such severe pain that I thought I was going to pass out. While sobbing, I called my mom (as I am at college—far away from home). I told her that I thought I broke my finger/s, and that I wanted to go to urgent care. My mom has never been empathetic for physical injuries and mental health issues. When she heard me, she told me to suck it up and rest. 

I figured I would wait for a while—who knows, she could be right. 

edit: I feel I should mention that my fingers did not look deformed, so other than the bruising and swelling I was unsure if they were broken or not.

While waiting, my roommate came home and saw the state that I was in. She took one look at my hand and assured me we had to go to urgent care. I didn't want to betray my mom, because she always said to never go to the ER or urgent care due to our ""terrible insurance"". However, I went and researched the cost of an out-of-pocket X-ray at the nearest urgent care, and it was only $200, which I was willing to pay. I told my mom this, and she said, ""you better hope your fingers are broken or else I'm not helping you pay for anything"". 

So I was under a weird circumstance where I hoped my fingers were broken for the sake of saying ""I told you so"" to my mom.

I finally went to urgent care and got an X-ray. They confirmed both my pointer and middle fingers were broken, and may need surgery if not healed properly. 

When I called my mom back later that day and told her the news, she basically laughed and told me I should be glad that they were broken. 

Three weeks have gone by, and I have not spoken to her since. She's texted me and asked for updates on my fingers, but I feel conflicted on why she's suddenly acting like she cares when she clearly didn't in the first place. She's also not someone you can easily share your feelings with, so i'm not sure how to go about our next conversation. Should I just ignore it, or try to bring it up with her?

edit: I was not expecting the overflow of ""NTA"" comments, and I have gotten asked about why I believe I am the asshole. I spoke to my brother about it, and he told me that I was overreacting and that she just wants to check up on me, and probably feels bad for diminishing my issues.

My sister is 33 (female), and I’m 14 (female). She had a baby three months ago.

I just got out of school for the summer and really wanted to rest, but my sister decided she wants to finally get a job. Now she’s making me babysit my niece. I have zero experience with babies, and I get overstimulated easily. It’s been really hard for me.

I asked her if she could put the baby in daycare or something, but she refused. I decided to just suck it up, but it’s been exhausting. I have insomnia, and it’s hard to sleep when I feel like I need to be awake 24/7 to watch the baby. I’m constantly scared something might happen if I fall asleep.

I told my mom how I felt, but she said I’d just have to deal with it. Both my parents work, so I’m left alone with the baby for hours almost every day.

A few days ago, I got tired of everything. The night before my sister got ready for work, I snuck out and went to my friend’s house so I wouldn’t have to deal with it and could finally get some sleep. When I came home that morning after I saw all the missed calls and messages and my mom and sister were really mad at me. They said I was being selfish and lazy. My sister even quit her job because I told her I’d leave again if she kept making me babysit.

I definetly felt bad after It feels like my whole family is barely talking to me except for my dad and even he said I shouldn’t have done that.

(Also i love my niece this isn’t hate to her shes adorbs)


(A little edit for more info- I see my dad being brought up a bit but he works in different places with steel work so he’s very rarely home but we do call often, my nieces father doesn’t want anything to do with her or my sister it’s been that way since she was pregant anyway so she left him and moved back in with us, she had a job before but quit to take care of the baby when she was a newborn and up until now of course, Also her and my mom work at the same place so they’re both night shift jobs and they’re tired when they come home from working so I usually have to watch my niece a bit longer so they can rest when they get home since they expect me to sleep while I’m babysitting but I just can’t I’m so paranoid something could happen, even when I’m feeding the baby and she coughs even a little or if she’s sleeping too hard I panic.

1ntoz9d,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not bringing my daughter’s friend home and making her parents come get her?,"My daughter and I live about an hour outside NYC. Since she was a baby, I’ve taken her there most weekends. As she got older, she occasionally brought friends. They always know the rules: bring a bag with things for the train, carry your own stuff, stick together, expect lots of walking, and have fun. Phones are fine, but I encourage screen-free activities. I always speak to parents beforehand and emphasize the walking, we sometimes walk 45 minutes or more.

For her 12th birthday last weekend, she wanted to go to the city with friends, visit favorite spots, have dinner, and maybe see a show. My mom helped pay for tickets and joined us. My daughter invited three girls: two longtime friends who know the routine and a new friend, “Leah.” I called Leah’s mom, explained the rules, warned about the walking, and suggested Leah bring something for the train since the signal is bad. Leah’s mom said she was excited. My daughter also explained expectations.

On the train, Leah brought only her phone, got bored when the signal cut out, refused to chat or play games with the others, and complained. When we arrived, she immediately asked for a cab. My daughter reminded her we walk. As we browsed shops, Leah kept whining and asking for a cab. I stayed patient, offered water and snack breaks, and even suggested the subway to be nice, but she refused when she learned what it was.

A few hours in, we stopped for dinner at a place with options for everyone. Leah complained again and said she wanted to go home. I pulled her aside to check if she was sick or upset; she just said it was boring. I told her we’d be there a few more hours for the show, but if she wanted to leave, she could call her mom.

Leah called, and her mom asked me to bring her back. Even if my mom or I left with Leah and took a train back after we dropped her off, we’d miss the show, and my daughter wanted both of us there. I explained we wouldn’t head back until after the show. Leah’s mom didn’t want to pay for a train ticket or drive. She eventually sent Leah’s dad, who picked her up before the show. Leah stayed crabby through dinner.

Afterward, Leah’s mom trashed me to the other moms, but they backed me up, saying they wouldn’t expect me to cut the trip short unless a child was sick or hurt (which I would do). Now Leah’s mom won’t let her hang out with my daughter. I can’t help wondering if I should’ve just sucked it up and taken her home.

I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. 

In the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. 

I am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. 

They’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. 

Yesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. 

I had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. 

My kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. 

But afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. 

So AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",11987,0.95,11987,0,12653.0,666.0,1447,1751846334.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ltfwg9/aita_for_telling_my_family_if_they_dont_like_the/,False,True
1jieab3,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my friend to leave my birthday party because she brought her crying baby?,"Sorry longish post

I (27F) recently threw a birthday party at my apartment. It was a pretty low-key gathering with about 10 friends, lots of snacks, a couple of drinks, and just a fun night hanging out. Everything was going fine until my friend, Sarah (28F), showed up with her 7-month-old baby.

Now, I love Sarah, and I know she’s a mom, but I wasn’t expecting her to bring the baby to a party, especially since we had planned to play games, drink, and chat. The baby started crying almost immediately when they walked in, and Sarah tried to calm her down, but she was clearly struggling. At first, I thought it was just a momentary thing, but the crying continued for almost an hour**.......**super loud and non-stop. It was hard to hear anything over the noise, and some of the other guests were getting visibly uncomfortable.I eventually pulled Sarah aside and asked her if she could maybe step outside with the baby or take a break in the other room until the baby calmed down. I explained that it was just hard to enjoy the party with the crying. She was clearly upset and told me that I “should be more understanding” since she can’t just leave the baby at home, and she was doing her best to keep her calm. She ended up leaving shortly after, and now she’s not speaking to me. I feel bad because I know being a mom is hard, but I also feel like it was my birthday, and I wanted to have a good time without the crying baby. Some people think I was rude for asking her to leave, while others think I was just trying to protect the vibe of the party.

1na8ojr,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to pay for our firends now broken Iphone and sunglasses that our son broke,"
I am 28F, and my husband is 32M; our son in question is 6 months old. 

Whenever someone holds them, we warn them that they'll try to grab your glasses or phone, and sometimes even your hair. (We are trying to break this habit, but he is 6 months old) Now, I warned my husband that a friend of mine, 33 F, let's call her Jean, came to visit and wants to hold, which we didn't mind at all. I warned her about it all, saying, ""ohh, best taking your sunglasses off your head, he'll grab them. "" Now these are Gucci sunglasses costing almost 800 pounds ( which to me is a crazy amount for sunglasses, but each to ther own), she rolled her eyes at me, and accused me of hogging my own baby 🤷‍♀️. I warned her again, she said, "" It's fine. 

So she stood holding him. Took her phone out wanting to take a selfie, which again I am fine with as long as it's not posted ( dont want a pic of him online as of yet.) He, of course, grabbed her sunglasses, got excited as he got them, waved his hands about the sunglasses, and they flew. She screamed, scaring him. He panicked and flailed, hitting her iPhone to the floor. I quickly took him as she was freaking out.

She says I need to buy her a new iPhone 16 and replace her sunglasses, or give her the money for them, which is £2300.

I said, ""we can't pay that as that's not even my monthly wage. Plus, I am on maternity, but also I dont feel like I should, as you ignored my warnings. "" I'm called Heartless for not being more understanding of her upset. I was more concerned with calming down my son. My husband just shrugged, telling her I did warn her. 

I fixed the issues since they were so triggering to people. Also, to those who thought an adult didn't write this, adults can have dyslexia. dyslexia

1hf3hjd,AmItheAsshole,AITA for accepting cake at my friend's birthday party?,"So this is a bit of a weird one. I (41M) was at a friend's birthday party on the weekend just past. There were 9 of us at the party including the birthday boy (which is surprisingly relevant). All fake names from here on out.

Amy (30ish F), one of the guests, baked a cake for the birthday boy. After the relevant party traditions of singing the birthday song, and the hip-hip-hooraying that happens after the birthday song here in Australia, I went back to talking to one of my friends when Amy came up to me and the other friend with 2 plates of cake and offered them to my friend and I. We both said yes, thanked her, and then she made a really odd face and walked away. My friend and I both said it was weird, and went back to chatting. I ate some of the cake and it had desiccated coconut inside it, which I don't particularly like, so after a couple of bites, I ignored it and then chucked it out when the party ended about an hour or so later.

About 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her. I replied, ""Why did she even offer me any cake if she knew there was coconut inside?"" Steven said that she did it to be polite and not leave me out, and that I was an asshole for taking her slice and throwing it away.

I forwarded the message to my other friends that were there, and most of them have left me on read so far, except one who responded with a thumbs down emoji, and another who hasn't seen it yet (as of this writing). The fact that no one's responding to me is making me worry that I might have been the asshole here.",11860,0.98,11860,0,12107.0,247.0,2320,1734299790.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hf3hjd/aita_for_accepting_cake_at_my_friends_birthday/,False,True
1lcezl9,AmItheAsshole,AITA for locking the bedroom door when my husband works?,"I work first shift and my husband works second shift. Because of that, I often spend nights alone. He gets home around 2am. 

I lock the bedroom door when I am home and he is working. I would hear noises and be not sure what it was, and I got tired of checking. It was usually my cats or an appliance. But I got tired of checking. So I lock the door so if I hear a noise, I know it’s the cats or an appliance and if not, I have a locked barrier between me and whatever it could be. And when I go to sleep, I unlock the bedroom door so he can get in. 

Last night he came hours early. He was cut from work because it was extra slow. I didn’t hear him come in through the front door because I had the TV and air conditioner on. If I did hear him, I always go out to say hi and I unlock the door as I do. But I didn’t hear him so I couldn’t. He tried to get in and found the door locked. It took me a few seconds to pause the TV and get my cat off of me and get up to unlock the door. 

He started questioning me about why the door was locked and what I was hiding. I told him I wasn’t hiding anything, I just lock it when I’m in here and he’s working just in case. He doesn’t believe me and thinks I was hiding something because it was locked and I wasn’t there instantly to let him in. 

So AITA for locking the bedroom door while my husband works?

Please don't say anything."" I said the smell is not from me. The BF got his nose close to my cousin upper body and smelled her. He kissed her on top of her head and told her it's humanizing when such a beautiful woman gets smelly. She laughed awkwardly.

I asked her why she is asking me that and she showed me a passage saying a guy has the features of a Greek god. So I told her 'You know, muscular and handsome.'

I noticed my mom giving me a weird look and asked her if something's wrong. She said 'Nothing'. Later asked me if I like my best friend(20m) because he's tall and muscular. I was taken aback. As it turns out, she had always assumed he and I are gay, which is not the case. I quickly told her we're not gays but she didn't believe me, saying the way we behave around each other leaves no other possible interpretation.

So I told her she should stop trying to interpret and see things that are not there. She said 'Okay' before telling me she told her friends that I am gay but haven't come out to her yet, and that she was worried about me keeping it bottled up inside.

I snapped at her for it. I have nothing against gays but I don’t want them to think I’m one when I’m not since it’ll only lead to awkwardness. Not to mention one of them has a daughter I have a crush on and might ask out. She said she only told them because she was worried about me and wanted some advice on what to do.

1k6ynzc,AmItheAsshole,AITA for snapping when someone rubbed my belly and implied I might be pregnant?,"So today, my office building was throwing a little fiesta-themed event and they offered free lunch in the cafeteria. A bunch of us went down to grab food.

While I was standing in line, I opened the Nest camera app to check on something and saw a little bird that’s been showing up outside every day. I laughed and casually said to no one in particular, “This bird comes to visit me every day.”

Right after I said that, a coworker (who has made pregnancy comments toward me before) came up, rubbed my belly without asking, and said something like, “Maybe it’s because you’ve got a baby bird on the way.”

I felt this immediate wave of rage—like why are we still doing this in 2025?? So I said, “Don’t be wishing that kind of bad luck on me.”

She looked super taken aback, and my boss (who overheard) also looked at me like I’d just said something offensive. It felt like I was the crazy one for being upset. But I didn’t ask to be touched, I’m not pregnant, and I really don’t like people making those kinds of comments about my body.

Now I’m wondering—AITA for reacting the way I did?

EDIT:

I am not overweight, which only makes it weirder cause I do not look pregnant.



There’s a couple of rays of sunshine trying to make me feel bad about my weight… maybe I need to be more specific, my coworker did not do this out of my “looks” that’s why I’m concerned cause even tho yes I’m not the fittest person, I know I don’t look pregnant.

1m5qpop,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking for my dead sisters  ring back after my brother used it to propose,"my sister died when i was like 6 and she was 17. we weren’t super close or anything but i still remember little bits of her. her laugh, how she always painted her nails, her posters. she was like this perfect angel to my mum after she passed. i barely remember the funeral.

when i was like 12 i found this old ring in her stuff. nothing fancy, just a silver ring w a small stone. it fit me and idk why but i kept it. it wasn’t some big dramatic thing, i didn’t steal it or anything, i just… took it and started keeping it. i didn’t wear it loads or flaunt it, just had it in this little box and sometimes i’d look at it when i missed her. it kinda became this one thing that felt like mine, like my piece of her

so anyway last weekend we had this family lunch and my brother (27m) brings his gf who everyone knew he was gonna propose to. and yeah, he stands up, does the big speech and pulls out THE ring. my sister’s ring. the one i’ve kept for like 7 years

i literally froze. his gf starts crying, ppl are clapping, i’m just sat there like wtf. i look at my mum and she just smiles at me like nothing happened. after dinner i ask her was that the ring and she’s like yeah, your brother asked me and dad and we said it was fine. she said it was sweet and symbolic and my sister would’ve wanted it passed down or whatever

and i was like ??? it was never yours to give tho??? like i’ve had it for years?? and she just goes oh come on it’s just a ring don’t be dramatic. but like when i had it it wasn’t “just a ring”

so yeah i kinda snapped. waited till ppl were outside and told my brother i wanted it back. he laughed at first then was like no wtf and i said ok well then i’ll tell your gf where it came from and let her decide. he got mad said i was ruining his proposal and making it about me like always. my mum dragged me into the kitchen saying everyone noticed i wasn’t happy and that i left halfway thru dinner. yeah bc i was crying in the bathroom like ????

dad tried to calm it down but my brother kept going on about how selfish i was and that i’d been weird about my sister for years. i didn’t even say anything i just left early and haven’t spoken to any of them since. mum rang me yesterday saying have i calmed down and am i ready to say sorry and i said not really and she hung up

my cousin texted me later saying it was actually super messed up and she doesn’t blame me but idk. i probably could’ve handled it better but i just felt so blindsided. it’s not even about the stupid ring it’s just like. they acted like it didn’t matter to me. like i didn’t matter

so yeah. aita?

1hudlhy,AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving my dad’s birthday dinner after overhearing my sister’s comment about my miscarriage?,"A few months ago me (28f) and my sister “Eva” (33f) realized that we were both pregnant (I’d say she was about 6 weeks further than I was). She’s been struggling with infertility, so we were all happy for her. I have an older son (2m) with my husband (32m). 

Sadly, a couple weeks ago I lost my baby. We told my family. They were all supportive, but I did sort of pull away from them. They would’ve tried to avoid discussing Eva’s baby around me, but I didn’t want to overshadow her, especially since she’s wanted this for a long time. I also didn’t want to be reminded of my own loss whenever I saw her.

So I haven’t been to my parents’ place for Sunday dinner since or really spent time with Eva, which we had been doing a lot before. I replied vaguely to any messages about my absence, wasn’t the best communication from me.

Yesterday my parents were hosting family dinner for my dad’s birthday. I’d been thinking about going because I missed my family, and while of course the pain of losing my child has not faded, I’m at a point where I can at least put it a little to the side to be there for my sister and my new niece (when she is born). 

So I let my family know that we would be coming. However, we had to get a gift for my dad and then my son had a bit of a tantrum, so we got to my parents’ place about an hour late. I wished my dad and then went to the kitchen, where my mom, Eva, and my SILs were.

But before I went in, I heard them say my name so I stopped. My mom was saying something like “Well I guess [OP]’s not coming” and Eva said “What did you expect, she probably changed her mind and is just staying home again. Honestly, I’m sorry for her but you would think she was the first woman to ever lose a kid. And it’s not even her first kid.” They then kept talking about other things, but I just wanted to leave. 

I went and got my husband, who was with my BIL, dad, and brothers in the living room. I told my dad I was really sorry but we needed to go. They all protested, but my husband could see how upset I was so he didn’t. We got my son and left. 

When we got home, I just kind of cried for a while. My husband asked me what happened and I told him. He was angry that she said that, but thought we shouldn’t have abruptly left because my dad had been looking forward to seeing us, and my son missed his cousins.

After this, I was feeling conflicted. Later my brother texted me saying my dad had been really upset about us leaving and brought it up at dinner, which caused a whole fight because mom and Eva realized that I must’ve heard them talking, and my dad was mad about it. My brother said that it was pretty bad and he wished I had just stayed so none of it would’ve happened, obviously Eva didn’t mean for me to hear that, they were all just frustrated that I’d been AWOL for so long. 

Now I feel bad, because I didn’t mean to ruin dinner. Obviously what Eva said was hurtful, but I can see how my actions might have led to her saying something out of anger, and I could’ve talked to her about it later instead of just leaving. Idk, AITA?


ETA for additional context:

- My family is the type to just drop by at each other’s places and see one other multiple times throughout the week besides just Sunday dinner. Lately I’ve been kind of fielding off any requests for people to visit. I just want to I guess emphasize how close my family is and how abnormal it is for me to not be seeing them regularly even for a little bit. I haven’t been ghosting them, but I just text them saying “I’m not feeling up to it” for dinner and kind of leave it there.

- My sister and my mom have always been closer to each other, as have me and my dad. Additionally, my brothers are closer to her since they’re all closer in age.

- I mentioned this in a comment, but we didn’t text anyone saying we were going to be late since my family is usually pretty lax about time (me and my husband usually show up early though so it’s unusual for us to be late and might’ve been why they thought we weren’t coming). Also my son was continuing to be a handful all the way there so that kept us busy and we kind of didn’t think about notifying anyone.

- I’ve started looking into grief counseling, now that I feel like I can at least talk about it.

- As far as she’s told us, my sister hasn’t had a miscarriage before, she just had trouble getting pregnant to begin with.

- From what my brother told me, my sister and mom didn’t admit to saying anything, they just kind of looked at each other once my dad mentioned me leaving, and he noticed and asked about it. Then one of my SILs who was also in the kitchen (my other brother’s wife) mentioned what they said and my dad got mad. My other brother was also apparently angry with them and it just turned into my mom and sister trying to defend themselves, my dad and other brother yelling, and my brother (who texted me) trying to stay out of it.

1j7wfci,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my boyfriend's mom to call me by my actual name?,"I (30M) have a name that, in English-speaking countries, is usually a gender-neutral nickname (think Alex, Charlie, Frankie etc). I am half Asian, and in the country of my name's origin, it's a unisex name that isn't short for anything.

Since I first met my boyfriend's (46M) mom (70sF), she has repeatedly asked what my name is short for. I've told her it isn't short for anything and different languages just have different naming conventions, but she keeps asking anyway. She also makes other related comments that make me uncomfortable - asking where I'm ""really"" from; that it doesn't make sense for me to have a name from Country A if I'm ""really"" from Country B; that she hates the trend among young people of having gender-neutral names and I must have a ""proper"" name she can call me. I've talked to my boyfriend about it, and he says he gets why it's uncomfortable, but doesn't want to bring it up because she wouldn't understand. I've started clarifying what my name is and asking to leave it at that, because I'm sick of answering the same questions every time.

Last time we saw her, she greeted me by calling me a ""long version"" of my name (eg Alexis instead of Alex). I didn't say anything but my boyfriend laughed, assuming it was a joke. However, she continued to refer to me by this name, despite mine and my boyfriend's corrections, until I eventually snapped at her to stop. I'm usually polite in trying to divert these kinds of comments, but being referred to by a Western name really pissed me off, and I said something like, ""Can you stop this bullshit with my name please, I've had enough of it now and it's fucking racist.""

She got really upset, saying she couldn't believe I would speak to her like that. I left the table, and my boyfriend shouted after me to come back and apologize, but I went outside to calm down. Eventually, my boyfriend came outside to tell me to apologize for swearing and calling her racist. I said I would apologize for swearing, because I shouldn't have been disrespectful, but I wasn't going to apologize for calling what she said racist. He said she doesn't see it as a race thing and she just finds my name a little funny, so I told him to forget it, I was going to drive home and he could get an Uber by himself.

I left by myself and he came home later. I apologized for leaving without him, and he said he understands why I was upset, but I need to apologize to his mom because she's really hurt that I called her a racist. I said I hadn't called her a racist, and that I wanted to apologize for swearing, but didn't want to apologize for saying that what she said was racist, because then she'll just keep doing it. However, I'm worried I'm wrong to be so stubborn, because my distinction between saying something racist/being a racist feels kind of pedantic, and because she keeps phoning my boyfriend to tell him he shouldn't allow me to talk to his own mother like that.

1lq038o,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting my niece sew me a dress for a big career moment because she doesn’t do a good job?,"I love my niece, and I support her creative expression. I’ve told her that she could make me a dress for running around the house, running errands, hanging out, etc. I’m happy to wear something she’s made at times where it’s appropriate. I’ve worn the acrylic scarf she crocheted me for a few years now and it’s not because it looks good.

She uses youtube and tiktok tutorials, so she doesn’t know how to work off patterns, make tailoring adjustments, choose the right fabric, etc. On tiktok and other social media spaces the “cool” thing to do is announce that you made your garment from a ratty thrifted sheet using an old pair of shorts you had lying around. Sometimes it looks good, sometimes it doesn't. But she doesn’t take the time to do things like pressing or finishing steams, trimming or sewing in ends, etc. When I’ve suggested it to her, she said it’s more authentic the way she does it.

She begged me to do an outfit for an event I have coming up where I’ll be on stage. I tried to let her down gently and said that I had a dress being tailored as we speak. She said I could wear that one to something else, but that I should wear something she made because it would be special and a bonding experience for us. Everyone in my family is obsessed with “bonding experiences.” Everything has to be a bonding experience between the adults and kids. It’s exhausting.  I reiterated my no, saying “No, I do not want you to make me anything.” 

Her mom (my sister in law) is telling me that I care way too much about my appearance and my image. This is an event related to my career. The last thing I need to do is walk up on stage in something that doesn’t fit, or looks like it was made with a sheet. And especially because I am plus sized, how I look is judged more harshly.

SIL complaining about me being superficial is not new. I dared to buy ONE designer bag for myself and she did the whole thing you see on Reels, the whole “STUPID! I would just thrift a bag and put the rest of my money IN the bag!” bit.

1jkw66s,AmItheAsshole,AITAH for refusing to drive if my wife is in the car?,"For years, after we got married, I could never figure out why I would be so angry and moody anytime my wife and I went somewhere.  Then it finally clicked.  I was only in a bad mood if I drove with my wife.  My wife is the absolute worst back seat driver I have ever seen.

Doesn't matter how I drive, she still finds things to complain about.
 
Why did you go this way?  If you would of went that way we would be there by now!

You're driving too fast!
You're driving too slow!
You could of made that light unfuckingreal!
That light was red and you blew threw it!
Can you brake any harder idiot!?
There were 17 great parking spots and you had to choose parking spot 18 which is the absolute worst!  

You turned your blinker on too late!
You turned your blinker on too early!
Why are you accelerating so slowly?
Whoa!  Was it necessary to accerlate that quickly?  Etc...

So for the past couple of years, I have refused to drive.  I now make her do all the driving.  And lo and behold, I'm no longer a grumpy person when we travel.  

 She has now gotten upset that she now is always driving and told me I needed to atleast split driving 50/50 with her.  I told her if she could keep her opinions to her self while I was driving then I would.  She agreed.  So Last weekend I started driving.  She couldn't even last 3 minutes without criticizing my driving.  I pulled over and told her I'm done.  Either she takes over driving or we're going home.  She eventually took the wheel.  As she muttered that I drive like a moron even though there's only one of us who has any tickets and has at fault accidents on their record and it's not me.

So AITAH for refusing to drive if she's present?",11521,0.98,11521,0,11761.0,240.0,837,1743050830.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jkw66s/aitah_for_refusing_to_drive_if_my_wife_is_in_the/,False,True
1i6u3os,AmItheAsshole,AITA for declining to invite a woman who has called herself ‘a total klepto’ into my home?,"I joined a Women’s Social Club 6 months ago because I’ve been struggling to make friends after relocating to a new-to-me city. It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often.

I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I’ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she’s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem “cool” to the other people in the group.

I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we’d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come.

Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn’t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying “I thought we got along” which yes, is true. 

I told her I’m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I’ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it. 

She said ‘Okay’ very quietly. She then said “You’re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don’t even know anything about me.” 

I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is.

This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I’m out of touch and take things too literally. Am I?",11493,0.98,11493,0,11732.0,239.0,629,1737495527.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i6u3os/aita_for_declining_to_invite_a_woman_who_has/,False,True
1o2fliz,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not disclosing my medical history to a stranger?,"I (F27) am an amputee. Ever since my amputation, countless people have asked me what happened to me. At first I wasn’t bothered by it and sometimes would poke fun saying a shark bit it off or some other random story. 

However, as time progressed it began to upset me more and more. I would get stopped in the middle of a parking lot, stopped in a busy aisle of the store, stopped on my way to and from appointments, etc. The part that bothered me the most is that they didn’t even have the decency to introduce themselves, make small talk, or even ask me my name first. Children are actually infinitely more respectful than these grown ass adults. 

One morning, I was outside a hotel I was in smoking. This lady came outside and immediately asked “What did you do to lose your leg?” Mind you, it was like literally 6am. I said (verbatim): “You haven’t said good morning, hello, or even asked me my name and yet you feel entitled to my medical history? Would you like that to happen to you?”

She started cussing me out and said that I was rude and a cunt etc. 

AITAH for saying this and feeling that was out of line?

TLDR: people always ask me what happened to my amputated leg as the first thing they say without even being cordial enough to introduce themselves or have small talk.

1k0hdqq,AmItheAsshole,AITAH for kicking my houseguests out 11 hours before their flight is scheduled to leave?,"My friend and his wife have made plans to visit us this summer for a weekend stay. The flight is two hours, so not a really long journey for them. 

We have our home professionally cleaned regularly and go all in to be good hosts to our guests. However, with any good thing, some people try to take advantage. 

I usually will take an extra day from work after guests leave to get rest or even tidy up the house a bit. It’s just a peaceful time for me to return to the normalcy of our household after being in host mode. Before my friend booked his flight, my husband let it slip that I will not be working the Monday after my friends’ stay with us. Next thing I know, my friend tells me that they will be flying out on a red eye the Monday I  took off for rest. This means they will arrive early Friday morning, and leave late Monday night. To that I responded that I will be taking them to the airport as early as 8am Monday morning so I can have my day of rest like I planned. 

My friend tells me that he doesn’t understand why they can’t just hang out at our place or have us show them around town more on that Monday since they have a late flight. I explained to them that the day off is for me to rest, not to continue to be their host. I told them that they are more than welcome to leave their luggage here if they want to go explore on their own, but we will not be hosting them or playing tour guide after Monday morning. 

He goes on to admit that it was cheaper for him to book the later flight on Monday and that it’s not a big deal for him and his wife to just hang out at my house all day until it’s time for them to fly out. Keep in mind that I will have to take them to the airport or pay for rideshare because he refuses to pay.  I will also have to feed them. 

I told him that they are welcome to visit and stay with us, but staying at our house all day Monday is not an option and he needs to make other arrangements. He’s now accusing me of being a horrible friend and his wife says we’re AHs. Your thoughts?

1hio70x,AmItheAsshole,AITA for reminding my dad he didn’t pay child support? ,"Growing up I never really knew my dad. He was in and out of the picture and later years him and my mom would argue over his jail time for not paying child support. My mom died and I live in her house with my girlfriend and her child. 

In my adult life my relationship has been the same with my dad. He reached out after my mom’s death but he never really made the effort and it always felt that if he tried to have a relationship with me it was always for a new girlfriend or wife benefit not mine. 

My dad recently had a bed wreck and his apartment only had stairs. Him and his new wife acted like they will move into my home since it’s an old school ranch house. All one floor. 

I told him no. He asked my why I didn’t trust him and he would pay rent. I told him why would I trust him to pay rent when he never paid my mom child support for years. 

His wife told me that was a rude thing to say.  I told maybe my they should ask one of her kids (she has 5) or one of my dad’s 3 other kids because of 1 of 9 I’m not stepping up to help because my dad has never helped me. 

They accused me of dragging up their past and I told them their attitude is not going to mesh with mine long term.

1hlpdki,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my mom about my dads weaponized incompetence?,"I (18F) do all the shopping in the house. Its been my job since I was like 12. My dad hates going shopping so i never ask him. For Christmas, i am cooking. I had a very specific grocery list because im making things that i havent made before. My parents didn’t let me go shopping yesterday so I had to go today. My dad said he would grab certain things to help me out and i said okay. I gave him a list. I really needed chicken thighs and blocks of cheese. He came home with ground chicken and only mozzarella cheese thats pre shredded. 

I told my mom about it because this isn’t the first time hes done this and its made me upset. 
She got mad at me for being upset with him because we never ask him for anything. I have asked him multiple times to get things for me and he either gets the wrong thing, doesn’t get anything i need or complains. 

For example, i wanted to go shopping before my wisdom tooth removal. I had a list of things with pictures because he said he could grab it and certain brands make me sick.
He got 4/20 things on the list and said everything else was not necessary. He went with my money and said that.

Now my moms upset with me because she is in debt from always buying stuff for the house. But the whole reason that’s happened is because of my dads weaponized incompetence.
So am i the Asshole for being mad at me dad and telling my mom?

We’ve been close since college but lately it feels like I’m just... aesthetic filler to her. She picked her bridal party dresses without asking for input and they’re tight. Like SKIMS-meets-sausage-casing tight. I'm a size 16. The other girls are size 2–6. I asked if there were other options and she laughed and said, “Nooo I love how it looks with all different body types, like it’s giving real women.”

Excuse me?

I asked her straight up if she just wanted me there as some token diversity of size and she got quiet, then hit me with the “You’re so confident, though! That’s why I wanted you in it!” Which is honestly code for “you make me look better.”

I told her I’m not comfortable being someone’s walking body positivity prop, and maybe she should get one of her influencer friends instead. She cried, told me I was ruining her vision, and now the group chat is weirdly quiet.

1lcqpzv,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for requesting to remove my thesis partner from our research, which may cause her not to graduate?","So I (M) am in a college course with only 8 people, so we’re all pretty close. For our thesis, we were assigned to work in pairs and I got partnered with a woman I’ve already worked with several school projects before. She tends to do things last-minute, but she usually does them, so I wasn’t thrilled but figured we’d manage.

That changed quickly.

We both work night shifts, but she also has a kid. I get that, and I’ve really tried to be understanding. But I still managed to interview her three times over three months, while she was constantly unavailable. When it came time to transcribe the interviews (each an hour long), we split the work, but she didn’t do any of hers. I ended up doing all of it just to keep us from falling behind.

Then came encoding, which is the most tedious and time-consuming part of our paper. We split the work again, and for almost a month, I kept bugging her and messaging her to finish her part, and she never did. I eventually gave up and just did the whole thing myself. I told our advisor, and they made her pay for the subscription to the software we were using as compensation. But that was the only thing she contributed.

Still trying to be fair, I asked her to handle our thesis defense presentation and script instead. But on the day of the defense, the presentation was unfinished, and I had to fix it myself right there in the room. She arrived 1.5 hours late, and the script she gave only covered 20 pages for a 45+ slide deck.

After the defense, we were told to redo the encoding and rewrite chapters 3 and 4 separately so we could compare and combine. I started mine right away. She? Still hasn’t done anything. I’ve been consistently messaging her to ask for updates, to follow up on her encoding, her write-up and I just got “yeah I’ll do it” but still nothing. And I constantly see her active on Facebook and posting stories.

Finally, I asked our advisor if I could submit the thesis under my name only, which would mean she won’t graduate . Now people are telling me I’m being too harsh and should just carry her one last time, but I honestly feel like I’ve carried her through the entire thing already.

AITA for doing this, even if it might cost her graduation?

1kzbn3v,AmItheAsshole,AITAH for telling my parents that they neglected me because of my brothers illness?,"So I'm a 16 year old girl and I have an older brother who is 20 and he moved out about 2 months ago.

My brother has misophonia. I don't know everything about the illness and I dont wanna say anything wrong, but its basically being triggered by certain sounds. He was diagnosed at 7 when I was 4 and he has a very strong version of the illness I think.

Me and my brother used to get along ok, but it got worse after that. Funnily enough all of his triggers were connected to me. My laughing, my walking, my eating, everything seemed to trigger him. I remember my father yelling at me when I was like 6, because I laughed while my brother was also in the car. I wasn't allowed to eat dinner with them, my parents would eat with him and when he was finished he could leave and then I could get my food. I didn't even really understand what was going on, because I was a little kid.

I was often alone, because I couldn't go anywhere with them and would trigger him and when we did something together it didn't feel the same, because even alone, I was always scared to do something wrong and get yelled at. Even in school I would barely talk or laugh.

I was never very close with my family and spend most time alone in my room or with friends outside.

Since my brother moved out my parents are trying to get me to connect with them more. This morning my mom asked me if I wanted to go see a movie with her and I was already in a bad mood, because I was stressed due to exams, so I sorta just snapped and told her I didn't want to and to stop trying to fix things with me, because it was ruined and that she couldn't fix the neglect they put me through simply by watching a movie with me. She then yelled back at me and told me to stop being jealous of my brother and that they were doing the best they could and that they didn't wanna neglect me and just tried to take care of my brother.

I just left after that and both my parents have been ignoring me all day and now I feel kinda bad, I still rlly love them

EDIT UPDATE: So I dont know how many people are still gonna see this considering its probably not shown on the main page anymore, but I wanna provide at least a little update here. Many people suggested I show this post and the comments to my parents and I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do, considering the whole situation in general, but I did do it a few hours ago and it didn't go too well.

Well didn't go too well, my parents have been and are still yelling at each other in the living room right now and I'm just sitting here.

1ol30a8,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not saying thank you when a parent returned my son's lunch box,"I (35F) have a son (4M), let's call him Ben. I pack lunch for all my kids and purchased Bento lunch boxes for each of them. They go for about $50 on Amazon. I label my kids lunches, lunch box, as well as pretty much everything they own and take to school. A few weeks ago when I went to pick up my son from school on a Tuesday, I noticed that his book bag was a little light, and when I looked inside I realized that he was missing his Bento box. No biggie - I mentioned it to one of the after school teachers and she said that she had accidentally sent it home with another kid (he has a similar name to my son - let's say Ken). I should note that I have never met this kid or his parent.

Any way, again, no biggie, I just kindly asked her have the parent return the lunch box the next day. The following day I inquired about the lunch box and the teacher said that the parent had messaged her saying she would bring it the following day as they are PT students coming on T/Th. Alright cool. Thursday comes around and after school I'm like okay, where's my son's lunch box. The teacher tells me the parent forgot it but will def bring it next Tues. I'm a little annoyed, but I figure I'll give the parent some grace. Next Tue comes, and no lunch box. At this point, I'm properly annoyed. I mention the missing lunch box to my son's daytime teachers. Asking them to reach out to this parent so I can get my son's lunch box back because wtf.

Fast forward to another WEEK. Still no lunch box. Apparently the mother is postpartum and very forgetful. She made a joke to the teacher saying the lunch box was getting closer to school because she put it by her front door. Needless to say, I'm properly pissed. I really don't understand why this is such an ordeal...just put the lunch box in your car or your kid's book bag to bring to school. My husband wants me to find the parent and confront her myself, but the teachers won't give me her name, and I can never catch the kid or her at pick up. Sooo I send a very stern email to the principal, admin, and all my son's teachers expressing my frustration with this and explaining that I want my kid's stuff. I guess they FINALLY are able to get through to this parent and the next Thursday (nearly 4 WEEKS later), she meets me and brings the lunch box. She apologizes and she tried to joke about the situation, but I was so annoyed that I just kind of stared at her blankly. Then I just said okay, took the lunch box and left. She apparently told some of the other parents that I was rude to her and that I could have been more APPRECIATIVE that she brought the lunch box back. Ma'am...(eyeroll). So anyway, AITA for not saying thank you?

  
EDIT: Soooo last Friday we had a Halloween parade at the kids school and a lot of the parents were there. One of the parents who heard about the “hostage lunchbox,” was chatting me up and I was explaining the situation, and for those of you who said she wanted it for herself - spot on. Apparently her son really liked it and was always telling his mom for it, but she didn’t want to get it for him. When it was mistakenly put in her son’s bag, she thought it was the perfect opportunity to just keep it. She thought I would just let it go and she would be able to keep it for her son. But no dice on that. Circling back to the folks who were talking about the price of the lunchbox — it’s BECAUSE it’s expensive that I wanted it back. I’m not made of money and I buy quality stuff for my kids so they can last throughout the school year and beyond, so for me to just “let it go,” and then have to spend money to purchase another one wasn’t going to happen. Plus I really did feel like she was playing games with me. Anywho, I’ll admit that I wasn’t the nicest when she returned it (I'm only human), but when I saw her at the parade I made sure I was polite-ish and showed her the link if she wanted to get the lunchbox for her kid as well as mentioned that there were some less expensive options. All's well that ends well.",11101,0.9,11101,0,12489.0,1388.0,3082,1761936777.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ol30a8/aita_for_not_saying_thank_you_when_a_parent/,False,True
1hgygoz,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not attending my family Christmas gathering because I can’t afford the $250 white elephant gift?,"My (29F) family has a tradition where we do a big Christmas get-together every year, and the highlight is the white elephant gift exchange. It’s always been a fun time, but this year my family decided to raise the price limit to $250 per gift.

I’m honestly a little shocked. I get that inflation has hit, but that’s a lot of money for one gift, especially for something that’s supposed to be fun and quirky, not something super expensive or meaningful. I have a pretty tight budget this year with unexpected medical bills, and just general life expenses. After paying for all my bills and essentials, there’s barely enough left to get by. The idea of spending $250 on a gift is totally unrealistic for me. xpected to show up for the family dinner and festivities.

I started feeling like I was being pushed out of the tradition because of my financial situation. I told her that, honestly, if I can’t participate in the gift exchange, then I might not come at all. I didn’t want to be the person who has to sit awkwardly and watch everyone else exchange expensive gifts when I couldn’t contribute. Plus, I didn’t want to feel embarrassed about not meeting their expectations.. My mom thinks I’m being “petty” and that it’s “just one gift.” My dad says I’m overreacting and that it’s not about the price, it’s about the spirit of Christmas (which, to be fair, I do agree with, but still—$250??). Some of my siblings are saying I should just suck it up and “join in” because it’s about being together, while others are telling me they agree with me but are still going to participate since the majority of the family agreed to this.

 There’s approximately 18-25 people in my family that will be there, and we are still expected to get gifts for our family members as well. I really don’t want to make a big scene or cause drama, but at the same time, I feel like this is a massive financial burden that’s being placed on me, and I just don’t know if it’s worth it to show up and feel out of place…

So, aita if I decide to sit this one out? 

Edit: to clarify $250 is the amount my family “agreed” to when it comes to the cost of the gift. I don’t even think a maximum amount was discussed.

1hxr5ew,AmItheAsshole,Update: AITA for leaving my dad’s birthday dinner after overhearing my sister’s comment about my miscarriage?,"[link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/7nVIk1V4PJ)

Hi everyone, I want to thank you all for the support and feedback on my last post. This update is mostly about a few different conversations that I had.

I took your suggestions and called my dad, apologizing for leaving early. He completely understood. We talked a bit and he asked if we could go out to lunch this week because he missed seeing me, so we made plans.

Then, I talked to my husband and told him that I didn’t think I could’ve stayed and still thought leaving was the best thing for us. He apologized for invalidating my feelings and said he would’ve liked for us to spend time with family but not at the cost of my mental wellbeing. He offered to call my brother (not the one who texted me) to set up a playdate for our son with his kids so my son could see some of his cousins, which I appreciated.

Later, my mom called (I guess my dad told her we talked) and she apologized for taking so long to call, saying she felt ashamed and didn’t know how to talk to me. She said she wouldn’t have let Eva say that if they’d known I was there and that she didn’t mean it. Eva has been hormonal and frustrated, and my mom thought calling her out at that point would've just made things worse. She felt terrible for hurting my feelings. I thanked her for the apology but told her I needed more time before meeting her.

After this, Eva texted me, and I wanted to hear her out, so I called. She apologized a lot and emphasized that she didn’t mean it and regretted saying it, attributing it to the same thing my mom had. Apparently she and BIL also had a big fight about it when they got home, which delayed her talking to me.   
  
We had a long conversation, in which she confessed that she had a few early miscarriages before they even told us she was pregnant. But she felt she had to keep smiling through it, which made her slightly resent how I was handling my situation. I told her I was hurting and keeping my distance so she could enjoy her pregnancy. She felt bad for misunderstanding and thinking I was shutting everyone out. I assured her that this wasn’t the case; I hadn’t let anyone in, and with her being pregnant, it was tough for me. I wished her luck but told her I hoped she could understand why I didn’t think I could be there with her. She was sad but agreed.

We talked more, and by the end, things were better. I texted my family group chat with a long message about how I was feeling and why I would be taking space from meetups, because I feel I need it after this. While the apologies eased my mind and I can see myself forgiving them in the future, I am still hurting, and I think right now, I need to spend time with my husband and son and handle my grief with a professional.

1ik31ah,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my SIL to get over herself and stop trying to one up us,"Throwaway account. My (29M) wife (27F) and her sister (30F) got pregnant around the same time. The babies are the first of a new generation on their side of the family so everyone was excited. SIL was further along, but my wife ended up giving birth on week 32, plus she had some complications that had her hospitalized. My nephew was born 2 weeks later at full term.

Apparently SIL was resenting ""having her thunder stolen"" and felt like she and her new baby weren't getting enough attention. She keeps making these comments like she's trying to one-up us. First she was saying how sorry she was that my wife missed the ""golden hour"" because they had to take our son to the NICU. This upset my wife since during her hospitalization she was often too sick to visit the NICU and she's already feeling crappy about missing skin-to-skin on those first few weeks.

After we started to bring our son to family gatherings SIL started comparing the boys. Saying how much bigger and more alert her son looks like compared to ours and how he hit more milestones.

Last weekend we had lunch at my in laws'. My wife and I were excited to tell everyone that our son laughed for the first time earlier that day (he's 5.5 months old, 3.5 corrected). MIL and FIL were having a good time watching the video when SIL made another comment about how HER son did that a month ago. I don't know why that was the last straw, but I just about had it. I told SIL that she's pathetic for trying to one-up a freaking baby. That her full term son wasn't special for being more developed than a preemie. That she should get the f*** over not giving birth to the first grandbaby.

Needless to say this ruined lunch and my wife's family is pissed. I admit I was harsh with my words and tone and this was the first time I confronted her family like this. Up until now we'd each handle our own relatives. But these comments upset my wife and pissed me off. So AITA for being so harsh and not staying in ""my"" lane?",11026,0.98,11026,0,11256.0,230.0,583,1738955604.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ik31ah/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_get_over_herself_and/,False,True
1ht9y9g,AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving my mother's party after she insulted my daughter?,"I (36F) have a stepdaughter (14F), ""Anna"".

Her father and I married when Anna was two. I consider her to be my real daughter in every way that matters, and love her just as much as my biological children.

Most of my family adores Anna, she's a very sweet and hardworking girl who does her best to make them proud. However, my mother (55F) appears to not. She's never outright said that she dislikes my daughter or why, but I've always thought it's because Anna wasn't my biological child.

I've been teaching Anna to cook for a few years now. She asked me last year if she could start bringing her cooking to family gatherings and potlucks, and of course I agreed.

My mother started critiquing Anna's dishes. It began with just suggesting she add different spices or cook an ingredient a little longer, but over the past few months it's been getting worse. She doesn't criticize the dishes of any family members.

This Thanksgiving, she told Anna that the casserole she made was disgusting and inedible. I told my mother to stop criticizing Anna and that she was doing her best, but she just brushed me off, which was the final straw.

My family was in town this week to celebrate my mother's birthday. I had some curry that my mother had made about six months ago and given to me to freeze, so I reheated it and brought it to the party, and told everyone Anna had worked very hard to make it just like her grandmother always did.

Immediately, my mother started criticizing the curry, saying how Anna had added too much spice and overcooked the chicken. She even went so far as to tell Anna that she should stop bringing food to potlucks altogether.

I hadn't originally intended to make a big deal out of this, but that comment crossed a line. I informed my mother that it was her own curry that I had reheated, and Anna had not actually cooked it.

She immediately started sputtering and backpedaled, saying she was just trying to give constructive criticism and make Anna a better cook, but I knew she didn't really believe it. I asked her why she would treat my own stepdaughter so badly, and she admitted that she didn't see Anna as her real grandchild.

This was the final straw for me. I found my husband, Anna, and my other children, and told them we had to leave, explaining what my mother said. We probably won't be attending any family gatherings for the forseeable future either.

My mother has gone full scorched-earth on facebook and most family members have taken her side. She says that I ruined her party by leaving, and that I destroyed our relationship for someone who isn't even my ""real"" child. My husband is on my side, but he thinks that we shouldn't have left the party, since I'd already proven my point.",11022,0.98,11022,0,11252.0,230.0,671,1735978782.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ht9y9g/aita_for_leaving_my_mothers_party_after_she/,False,True
1kg8vng,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to let my daughter’s fiancé stay in our guest room because I use it for my hobby?,"So I (M49) might be in the wrong here, but I honestly don’t think I am, and would love to hear outside perspectives.

My daughter (23F) got engaged recently and came to visit us with her fiancé (24M). We live a few states away, so I get that traveling is tiring, but we were happy to host, for the weekend.

Now, I’ve had my guest room set up for my miniature wargaming for the past few years. It’s my space, where I go to decompress after work, and it's honestly the only spot in the house that's fully mine. My wife has the sunroom, and the rest of the house is kind of communal. I’ve got thousands of dollars of models in there, custom terrain, a 3D printer setup, etc. It’s not just a hobby, it’s an investment, and frankly, a form of art.

Anyway, when they arrived, I had the office couch made up for them, pull-out, memory foam, decent blanket, very clean. My daughter seemed fine with it, but her fiancé kind of made a face and later asked why they couldn’t just sleep in the guest room. I told him plainly it wasn’t available because it’s not a guest room anymore. It’s my studio.

Later that night, my daughter confronted me privately and said I was being selfish and ridiculous and that it’s just for two nights. She said they felt unwelcome and like I was prioritizing plastic figurines over family. I told her that’s not fair, they have a place to sleep. It’s not like I made them sleep on the floor.

Now my wife is giving me the cold shoulder and said I could have just packed it up for a weekend, but again, it’s not like these are toys you throw in a box. Some of them are fragile. Some are half-painted. I don’t want to spend days reorganizing and then undoing all that work just because they didn’t like the setup.

They left a day early, and now I’m getting texts from my daughter about how I chose my hobby over her happiness, which just seems dramatic to me.

I might be the asshole because maybe I could’ve moved some stuff around for a few nights, but I really don’t think it’s fair to expect me to dismantle my entire setup just because someone didn’t want to sleep on a perfectly good pull-out. I have a right to my space too, right?",10995,0.84,10995,0,13582.0,2587.0,5595,1746548957.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kg8vng/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_daughters_fiancé_stay/,False,True
1n2odkk,AmItheAsshole,AITA - Do not want a service dog to participate in my wedding.,"Throwaway

I'm (28F) am getting married in the spring.  I've asked one of my best friends to be one of my bridesmaids.  She has a service dog for PTSD.  I respect her dog and glad she has it in her life.  My Fiance and I don't particularly care for dogs, and we've decided we don't want her service dog in our photos or in the ceremony.  

When I asked her she got excited and immediately said her dog could wear something to match the rest of the bridesmaids.  Thats when I explained that the dog could come to the wedding, but wouldn't be an active participant in the day.  We don't want it in photos or in the ceremony.  It could go to photos, but not be in them.  It'll be off to the side for the 10-15 minute ceremony.  In preliminary discussions with our photographer we've brought this up. 

She did not take it well.  Called me an asshole and ableist and it was not a constructive conversation after the ask.  She hasn't accepted my offer to be a bridesmaid, but also hasn't declined formally.  AITA?

1kbwjfq,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a friend exactly why my wife and I wouldn't go on a trip with her.,"My wife and I (both 32, both F) have a friend named Anna (33). Anna is so sweet, very funny and can also be very naive. While this isn't *always* a bad thing, she is at times ignorant of how the world works/news etc. 

Anna has family that owns a large vacation property in another country. She's long wanted to take a friends trip there, and is finally planning on doing so. Multiple people have been invited, and this past weekend when she and I got coffee, my wife and I were invited. 

The problem is, homosexuality is criminalized in this country. In case you missed it, I am a woman married to a woman and I would not feel safe traveling there. I would especially be worried about my wife- she has a very classic ""butch"" look whereas I am more feminine. I know a lot of times these laws will pertain more towards gay men, but still. We would not feel safe, and that's what matters. 

(FWIW, my wife knew we were probably going to be invited and said ""fuck no"" to any idea of traveling there when I mentioned it. I didn't make a choice for the both of us by myself.)

I told Anna, no, I'm sorry but my wife and I would not be able to travel there. Well, she pressed why, I said ""because we're gay. That country criminalizes gay people."" She just said ""oh"" and kind of awkwardly changed the topic. 

Later though, I got a text. She said she felt I  embarrassed her for not knowing and while she didn't know, it's not like she's homophobic or anything, just that she wants to go on a trip there and why did I have to be so blunt about it? 

I'm really frustrated, and also- I feel bad. I'm not sure why. I guess I could have made an excuse, that airfare is pricey right now or we had something else planned but? My wife is saying I didn't do anything wrong. I don't know. AITA? 

EDIT- forgot to add, but I didn't include which country because I felt it was wrong. The government etc makes these choices- I would feel bad putting the blame on a whole country that certainly has an LGBTQ population, hidden or not. It's in the Middle East and that's all I'll say.

1jp0a41,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my brother in law to stop picking on my kids or he’s not coming on vacation?,"I have three kids, Rob (16m), Lisa (14f), Anne (9F). Lisa is autistic, and her special interest is Taylor Swift. Rob and Anne go along with it and indulge her. They’re good kids who care and support each other and Rob and yes Anne get attention and support for their interests too.

My brother in law Hector's entire personality is trying to rile people. You know the whole “it’s just a joke bro”. Super childish but whatever “he’s family.” Except my husband is out of the country, so I guess he thinks he gets to do whatever he wants.

A few weeks ago he started needling at Lisa by making fun of Taylor Swift using lots of childish name calling words, intentionally using the wrong word for fans and stuff. Just really immature kid stuff. Lisa knows that not everyone likes TS and some people even hate her. One of her best friends hates her. She’s not unable to hear different opinions. She has her own I’m sure she’d LOVE to share with you all if you had 4 hours to spare.

He would say “Well Swiffers did x y z” she would say “Uncle Hector it’s Swifties” and he would say it again to needle at her. Rob was in the room, I was not. Rob said to him “Why do you keep using the wrong word, she told you the right word?”

Hector said he can say whatever he wants and to “cry about it.”

Rob said “It just seems like you’re going out of your way to upset Lisa”

Rob asked her to finish what she was talking about and to ignore Hector. This is when I came into the room, and Hector waved at the kids and said “Roberta’s getting real mad that someone’s joking about mother (?)”

(I wasn’t in the room so I didn’t hear the comment about me and Rob said I wouldn't get it)

Before I could say anything Rob said “Bro did you really just call me a girl’s name? Are you 12?”

I put my hands up and said okay enough, Hector, stop. He said I’m raising soft kids who can’t take a joke. I said he’s being so effing rude and that he wouldn’t be acting like this if my husband was home. I said that if he wants to still go with us to Colorado in the summer like we were planning, he has to stop NOW or he’s not coming.

This set him off and he said I had no right to do that (yes I do) and that I’m being a controlling yak over Taylor Swift. I said no, fuck Taylor Swift, this is about you being mean to your niece because her dad isn't home.

He said fuck you and good luck next time we have a problem, we’re on our own. He took his Costco chicken and left and I swear he must have immediately gone running to my MIL because she called me to ask for what really happened and sighed a lot. I asked her if I was overreacting and she said she just hopes we can work it out because that trip was all he had to look forward to since he was laid off from work. I HATE causing drama in the family so am I the asshole and I’m out of line?

  
Thanks for all the feedback, I have a path forward. It also needs to be said that some of you are just inventing an entirely new story involving Hector losing his job because his has a bad personality. This is entirely fictional, this didn't happen. His job laid off almost everyone because they are struggling with money and likely won't recover.

1id64xi,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling ski patrol on a guy after he hit my son with his skis?,"My son (11M) and I (44M) recently booked a trip to go skiing in Colorado. It was my son's first time skiing, but he had seen a lot of skiing videos on YouTube, and he seemed really excited for the trip. We also live in Florida, so this is not the trip you can just go and do whenever you like (we are not rich). I grew up in Utah and I loved skiing when I was younger, and I would say I'm an expert on the mountain. The first day goes all good, and my son really enjoyed skiing for the first time, even though he fell a lot, lol. I made sure to be as supportive and caring as possible, even when he was struggling, because I wanted to make this as fun an experience as possible for him. However, on the second day of skiing, he says he's finally ready to ski down the whole mountain, and so we take the lift to the top. Luckily, there was a way to get down the mountain while only staying on green level trails, so we took that way. 

My son is having a blast, when all of a sudden, this guy in his 20s careens into my son from behind going on insane speeds, wiping them both out. My son immediately started crying and came running to me after he got his skis off, and once he calmed down, he ran to the lodge where my wife was, and she decided to take him to the doctor's office. I immediately confront the guy for being so reckless, and he simply says that I should have been paying better attention to my kid, and then he rode off. That was the final straw for me, and I called the ski patrol number in the app and told the guy the situation and what the skier was wearing, and they told me they would find him and kick him out. Later on, I saw him getting escorted out of the park by two ski patrol officers, and when he saw me, he immediately started cursing me out and calling me a horrible dad. I tried to ignore it, but now I'm second guessing myself if I overreacted.

1ldvlba,AmItheAsshole,AITA: I was yelled at today by a male co worker and clapped back,"I was yelled at today by a male co worker and clapped back. Still unsure if I did the right thing

I'm part of a team of 6 developers and I'm the only woman in the team. We have several teams and I get along well with everyone. I'm usually thought of us as nice to everyone, and joking around etc. I've heard several co workers tell me that they enjoy working with me.

Today I got into an altercation with one of my male co workers. He is stubborn and is known to have outbursts at people. Especially if we don't do exactly as he wants us to. He seems to struggle with nuances and gets mad at you if you don't solve something code related in the way that pleases him. He has been working at this company for over 10 years, whereas I've been here for a year so there's that. I've never been micro managed by someone as much as him and he is not even my manager or boss.

In short, the altercation was this: I was handed a document with descriptions of how certain software components in our code base is intended to work. Some of the descriptions are newly revised, so I have to rewrite code to fit the new description.

The descriptions were unclear, so I decided to email the engineer who had written the document. He is very well versed into the system design of these components, we can call him M. As I was typing my email, my male co worker exploded and was yelling ""I KNOW THESE THINGS, YOU SHOULD ASK ME. STOP BOTHERING M"". I'm usually cold in these situations and don't really care about his outbursts, but this one really caught me due to his usage of the words ""bothering"". I was typing a two sentence email, and he made it sound like I was sending M 100 of emails.

I looked back and responded ""I'm sorry, are you my boss or something? I'm emailing him because I want his explanation since he has written this document"". And he responded by saying ""you're so rude, that's so rude of you"" and I was like ""yeah, then go and cry about it"".

When I said the last words, the entire landscape went quiet. Usually no one stands up to this co worker and he is having angry outbursts without anyone stepping in and this is the first time I stood up for myself.

Did I do something wrong in this situation? Like, is it normal to have these outbursts at co workers? I'm second guessing myself all the time but I really feel like he is the unreasonable one.",10852,0.95,10852,0,11455.0,603.0,632,1750186595.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ldvlba/aita_i_was_yelled_at_today_by_a_male_co_worker/,False,True
1ofejo2,AmItheAsshole,AITA for trying to set a boundary with my little sister after she opened my birthday present?,"23F, little sister is 13F. I live back &amp; forth between my mum’s and my dad’s house. All of my siblings are half-siblings on my dad’s side.

I love my little sister but lately I've been getting annoyed about certain boundaries she crosses.

She’s obsessed with face cream, hand cream, body spray, perfume, any hair products that smell good, lip gloss/balm - she has a very big collection of all these things. I once sat and counted how many lip stuff she has accumulated over the years and I counted 37. Despite having TONS of her own, she always asks to borrow mine and often ends up using up the entire thing (one of my perfumes was almost completely used up because she would spray it at *least* 20 times every time she used it)

She gets upset if I don’t share my stuff with her. For example, I got a body mist from Bath &amp; Body Works recently because I loved the smell. I decided to leave it at my mum’s house. My sister saw it in the background during a facetime and said “oh that looks like it smells good, can you bring it the next time you come here?!” and I jokingly said something along the lines of “I think we’ve got more than enough perfumes at dads”, and she was visibly upset.

I’m quite a patient person so I brush all of this off bc she’s my lil sister and that's just what siblings do, right? But this recent situation has really upset me and I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not. So:

It was my birthday on Tuesday. I went to my dad’s to celebrate after work. When I sat down to open presents I noticed that all of them were intact except one, of which the packaging had been ripped open and the contents removed. Hm, weird, so I asked my little sister what happened and she told me that it was one of my brother’s gifts to me (a set that included hand cream, a nail file, a nail/cuticle oil, and a little nail clipper) and she “really wanted to try it” and couldn’t wait for me to open it so she decided to go ahead and open it herself and try everything out. Half the hand cream had been squeezed out of the tube, the nail file was used because it had those tell tale scratches on it, and the small nail/cuticle oil bottle wasn’t closed properly so it was also opened. I understand that, in the grand scheme of things, this isn’t a big deal, but it made me sad that she had just gone and opened my gift like that without even thinking to consult me first.

I said to her, verbatim, “You need to stop thinking all of my things are automatically yours too.”

Her mum taught her that everything that belongs to your siblings also belongs to you. Her philosophy: siblings share everything. So, setting a boundary is very difficult; 

My sister got mad because I “never share” my things with her anymore and am “purposely” leaving some of my stuff at my mum’s place to avoid her using them. Her mum called me “quite selfish” for belittling my own sister for wanting to be “closer to me” by borrowing my things.

AITA? WIBTA if I continued to be harsh about these boundaries?

1m7m35l,AmItheAsshole,AITA for forcing my diet on my boyfriend?,"I’m from France originally, and I moved to the states almost 2 years ago. Now for some reason, the food here makes me sick. Not in an “Ew, that’s gross.” Kind of way. But actually physically sick. My body seems to struggle to digest it. Whether it’s take out or fancy restaurant food. Either I can’t go to the bathroom for days, or I’m violently vomiting. I tried dealing with it for months and months, but I started losing weight very quickly because I couldn’t eat. I ended up developing a serious aversion to food, and my family recommended I go and speak to a specialist.

I had never had a problem back home, and I was terrified I was seriously ill. So I went to multiple doctors where I was poked and prodded and I had multiple tests done. They have all said nothing is wrong with me physically.

I spoke to a dietitian and he explained that my body is probably not used to the amount of salt and preservatives that is found in the food in the states. (Please don’t think I’m bashing the US! I love it here and it’s a great country.) My dietician recommended fresh and organic produce to see how my body coped, and to my delight, I improved.

I stopped vomiting and I was able to start slowly putting weight back on. I started making meals from scratch and meal prepping to save time throughout the week. My dad is actually a chef back home, so he was more than happy to send me some recipes to keep my diet interesting. I made a delicious vegetarian lasagna from scratch, and put it in the oven to cook. My boyfriend (American) came home after work and asked what was for dinner. I said I was making a veggie lasagna. He rolled his eyes and said he was sick of “that organic crap” and wanted a cheeseburger.

The comment hurt. I made a real effort at meal times to keep it varied so we’re not always eating the same thing. I said I couldn’t make one because I didn’t even have any burger buns. He said it was unfair to “make” him eat my diet. I had never realized he was opposed to it. He benefited from home cooked meals and I had seen that his clothes were fitting him better. He had more energy and he didn’t sleep so much on the weekends. I apologized and said I didn’t mean to make him feel forced.

1hvgupu,AmItheAsshole,"AITAH, for refusing to sign my neighbors “Use of Yard” waiver?","Last Thursday, my neighbors approached my wife regarding a Use of Yard waiver since they don’t have the clearance to move excavators and bobcats to their backyard to build a pool. The waiver states they need 10ft of clearance (4ft would be into our yard based on my measurements) and they would repair the grass to its original state. I have an irrigation system and internet lines which run beneath the area which would be used. The neighbors were leaving for FL and asked for a 48 hour turnaround.

I spoke to the pool company on Friday and the PM said they need 10-12ft and they need the waiver because there is a good chance the ground will be totally torn up.

It was my wife’s 30th birthday this weekend so this situation was not top of mind but my neighbor knocks on the door Saturday afternoon asking for a response. I kindly explain I am not comfortable signing the current waiver given the typos, lack of notarization, and ambiguities regarding repairs. He takes it personally and storms out of the house complaining about how much money he is going to lose.

Today, the project manager from the pool company knocks on our door asking what they can do to resolve this. I told him I really don’t want my yard torn up but at minimum a new waiver needs drafted and I would consider it. He then says we have an electrical easement which runs 1.5ft into our yard in the exact spot he wants to use and would just call for access. I check my plat design and deed to see there is NOT any easement running thru the area they need. He leaves and the situation is still up in the air.

Edit: thanks everyone for your input. I had run this situation by many friends and colleagues and the answers were consistently “no” unless you can get outrageous stipulations and even so it is still a risk. At the end of the day, I don’t want to be dealing with the pool contractor or neighbor to return my yard and irrigation to its original state.",10718,0.98,10718,0,10941.0,223.0,650,1736216251.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hvgupu/aitah_for_refusing_to_sign_my_neighbors_use_of/,False,True
1nkwbtw,AmItheAsshole,AITA for buying dishware at a thrift store before someone else could?,"This happened a few weeks ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I went to goodwill and saw a really lovely set of wood plates and 2 matching bowls. I actually needed them for their intended purpose. I was going to grab the stuff but there was this woman standing in front of them with her phone out loudly ccomplaining about how she can't find the maker's mark on the dishware as the bottoms were left blank. I assumed she was one of those resellers as her cart was filled to the brim with glassware and I did see a leather jacket in there too. I walked up next to her and asked if she was going to buy the dishes. She glared at me and said yes and told me to get lost she was here first. So I just said fine no need to be rude lady it was a simple yes or no question. 

I walked away to go look elsewhere and she was now looking in the books but the wood dishes were not in her cart. I walked over saw them still on the shelf and put them in mine. As I walked away she came back and noticed I had them in my cart and she started flipping her shit telling me she was going to buy those as they were from a super high end artist. I told her she walked away from the shelf and left them there if she really wanted them she should have put them in her cart. She immediately started grabbing my cart and taking out everything from my cart as I found a hoodie thing called 'the comfy' and some vintage pyrex in a collectable pattern. She said I am taking money away from good people like her and that she was losing sales because of people like me buying shit to use and not resell. I yelled to take her hands off my shit and by this point an employee stocking nearby came over and asked what was going on. Lady tried to say I stole stuff from her cart. I said she was stealing from mine. Reseller lady looked around and saw a different employee had taken her abandoned cart she left in the book section and was putting her stuff back. She freaked out dropped my stuff and ran after him. I looked at the employee who then just waved me off and I left with mt purchases.

Told some people about it and a close friend said I should have just given her everything because reselling is her job and another friend agreed with her. But they only said that when I said my 'the comfy' was a $50 garment.

1jso17j,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my dad's wife I'm sorry but she's not my mom?,"I (16M) was the product of what is pretty much a friend with benefits type relationship between my dad (at the time 33) and my mom (at the time 22.) My mom didn't want to be a mom. Yet my dad didn't want my mom to abort. From what little I have been told there was an agreement. My mom would leave, my dad would raise me on his own but if she wanted to, she could come back into my life whenever.





The first 7 years of my life were just my dad and I. He didn't date any other woman; it was just us two and his family. I remember my mom would send me gifts on my Birthday and Christmas with letters attached. I remember members of her family doing the same. When I turned 7, my mom came back. I started spending time with her. She would take me to parks, zoos, and aquariums etc. I also met her family. I loved this, although I now know my dad didn't like the fact that my mom randomly showed up out of nowhere wanting to spend time with me, although he did soften up to it over time. I still have contact with my mom. I don't see her as often as before. But I still love her and see her as much as possible.



There was no conflict due to this situation at all until when I was 14, my dad met a new woman. I will call ""A"" for this. A and my dad started dating when I was 14, married when I was 15. A brought her twins (15M for both) from her previous relationship into her marriage with my dad. I have a good relationship with both my stepbrothers. I have a decent relationship with A but 2 things always bugged me. 1. How my dad seemed to rush into marrying A (he proposed to her 3 months into their relationship.) 2. A wanted me to call her mom literally the day I met her. She had two reasons for this. 1. I don't have a mom, and I need one. 2. She wants our family to be more united. I always just shrugged this off. I got away with it because when my dad married A it's like he forgot about me completely and didn't care about me. I also felt like it wasn't my place to complain. 



That's the context of all of this. We're a year into Dad and A's marriage. A's birthday is coming up. All of us bought her a gift but she says she doesn't like physical ones and also said she wants a more ""verbal gift"" from me. Last night at dinner I learned what this was. She asked me if I say yes to letting her adopt me so she could be my mom. Of course it caught me off guard. I said no, I already have a mom. A doesn't like the fact I talk to my actual mom still, and she said that she's my mom because she's at home with me every day and is married to my dad. Then called my actual mom a part timer in my life. I told her no, I'm sorry I can't her son but even if my actual mom is a part timer she was there for me a long time before she was. I received an angry scolding for this from both my dad and A. A specifically has been cold towards me since then. I'm struggling to comprehend this, and need to ask anonymously if I was in the wrong here?",10683,0.95,10683,0,11277.0,594.0,1035,1743921893.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jso17j/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_im_sorry_but_shes/,False,True
1if2mc6,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not telling my uncles we won’t inherit anything?,"Before my(18m) grandma passed away, she and I had an arrangement. She gave me money to buy horror novels and I read them to her twice a week. We spent a fair amount of time together.

During one of our last sessions, she confided in me that she wanted to leave all her money to charities but decided to leave a college fund for my cousin(16f) since ‘Uncle Henry’ lost a massive part of his savings through gambling. The guy thought he could recover all he lost by making a big bet on Mike Tyson but then Jake Paul won, so he ended up losing even more.

Grandma asked me not to tell anyone about this and I didn’t. I kept my mouth shut.

When my dad and uncles found out, they reacted in different ways. Dad wasn’t really that surprised since Grandma was rather charitable, especially in her later years. Uncle Henry was grateful for the fund but ‘Uncle John’ was quite upset, saying that she’s their mom and should have left them something

All three of them got suspicious and asked me if Grandma told me about this during one of the afternoons I spent at her place. I admitted that I knew about it and Uncle John said I should’ve told them first instead of letting them find out this way.

1kejaif,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s wedding—or give a gift—after she invited my ex but excluded my wife?,"My (32F) sister (28F) is getting married in a few weeks. She recently sent out the official invites, and while I was included, my wife (30F) was not.

When I asked about it, my sister told me the decision was intentional. She said she wants her wedding to be “as peaceful as possible” and that she doesn’t feel comfortable having my wife there. For context: my wife and sister have never gotten along particularly well. There’s no major incident or explosive history—just mutual dislike and a few passive-aggressive exchanges over the years. That said, my wife has always been respectful at family gatherings, and I’ve never seen her act out.

What makes this worse, though, is that my ex-girlfriend (whom I dated for four years before meeting my wife) is invited. My sister remained friends with her after we broke up six years ago. I didn’t love it, but I never made an issue of it. Still, it’s incredibly hurtful to see that my sister would rather include someone from my past—someone I haven’t spoken to in years—over the person I’ve chosen to build a life with.

I told my sister that I wasn’t comfortable attending under these circumstances and that I wouldn’t be sending a wedding gift either. I said if she doesn’t recognize my wife as part of the family, then she shouldn’t expect me to play along with the celebration as if everything is fine. She accused me of being petty and trying to punish her for “setting boundaries.” My parents have since called to say I’m overreacting and that I should “just go and keep the peace.”

To me, this feels like more than a disagreement—it feels like a fundamental lack of respect for my marriage. But the family seems to think I’m making it about me.

1o64wiy,AmItheAsshole,AITA for replacing pictures of my cousins with pictures of my dog,"My grandpas birthday was a couple weeks ago. 6 weeks before his birthday, I texted all of my siblings and cousins (there’s 9 of us) and told them to send me a picture of themselves within the next 4 weeks so I could put it on a phone case for our grandpa’s birthday. 

2 weeks later I sent the text again, saying I needed a picture of them and anybody that chooses not to send a picture will be replaced by a picture of my dog. I had 3 cousins tell me to screenshot something from their instagrams. I didn’t respond. 

I sent a text out the day before I put in the order saying anybody that did not send a picture of themselves in the next 24 hours would be replaced by pictures of my dog. 

The same 3 cousins never sent pictures. Their spots have my dog in a sombrero, my dog at the pumpkin patch, and my dog in a chicken costume. 

They came over for my grandpas birthday and saw him open his new phone case. They saw that their pictures weren’t on the case and got mad at me for not picking something off their instagrams like they told me to. I said that I sent 3 reminders to send me a picture with a clear warning that anybody that did not send a picture would be replaced with a picture of the dog. They knew exactly what would happen. 

My grandpa finds it hilarious but their parents are telling my parents that I kept them off the phone case on purpose and they want me to apologize.

1lwqser,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for ""embarrassing"" my more fit coworker?","I am a camp counselor (25M) who works with elementary aged boys. To give some context, I am incredibly short and fat. Like, I am under 5 feet tall and around 200 pounds. This does not affect my ability to do my job. I'm just as active as any other counselor, I work with the kids just as much.I have to get blood tests done regularly for unrelated reasons (related to why I'm so short) and there's never really any concern when it comes to my cholesterol or insulin or anything weight related. I'm just saying this so you have some context for my general appearance and the fact that no, my weight doesn't affect my health or my level of activity.

My co-counselor is a guy around my age who is (I think) a baseball player. We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. 

The issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.

The issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the ""strong counselor"". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am ""embarrassing"" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy ""like me"". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure.

1k542y7,AmItheAsshole,AITA for explaining to my future SIL why her kids will never receive anything from us?,"I (27F) have a brother (33M) who has been dating his girlfriend Sarah for 2 years and he proposed a couple of moths ago. Sarah has 2 kids from her previous relationship 8M &amp; 6F. I would say that my parents and I are not very close to Sarah and her kids but we are cordial and never had any problems before. 

My partner, I, bro and Sarah attended the Easter dinner at my parents and that's when the drama happened. Sarah's kids were at their father's so Sarah used this celebration to confront us about my brother requesting a prenup. Basically my brother explained to her that he expects them to sign a prenup and that only his biological kids will have the right to inherit anything from our family assests. This is something that we as a family discussed before and we all agree that only our children should receive assests or money from our inheritance. My brother is free to pay whatever he wants for his stepchildren out of his own money, but my children and his bio children will never have to share anything that our family has with them.

Sarah claimed that we are being unfair and that we are treating her and her kids like some strangers instead of embracing them like family. She said that the normal and decent thing to do was for us to see her kids like my brother's kids who should have equal rights to any children they may have together. I told her sure, after she gets married to my brother she will become our in law and her kids will be my brother's stepchildren but this does not mean we have to share anything with them. I asked her, will my future kids receive anything from her parents or from their bio father's parents? She said no obviously so I asked her than why would her kids be entitled to receive anything from us? Sarah said because they will be our family so I told her that we have plenty of cousins that are also family but I don't go around wishing to share my inheritance with them. 

There was a lot more back and forth between us and Sarah was not letting this go. My brother asked her to stop because we were there to celebrate Easter, not to have this kind of conversation but she kept on going saying we need to clarify it once and for all. I told her from where we stand everything is clear and it is only her who has a problem. She said we are  greedy and cruel to some kids and I snapped. I told her to deal with it. She is free to work her ass off and gather assets to leave to her children but we will never divide anything outside of our family and she should not expect her children to be our problem or burden to finance. 

I honestly feel she is very manipulative and is using my brother for what she and her kids can get from him but that's my brother's problem to decide if this is the kind of partner he wants. I just want to know if I was too blunt in telling her the truth.

1i1ya0t,AmItheAsshole,AITA for no longer giving support to my wife's family after I became successful with my own company after they talked down about me.,"My (early-30's) wife (mid-20's) grew up in a fairly poor enviroment. Her grandpa had money, but her mom didn't and her sister doesn't. My wife has an incredibly strong work ethic (she's probably moreso defined as a workaholic). When I first met her, I was in trucking, making about 50k-70k/year. Since then I developed a niche for a speciality marketing field and became very good at it. All my friends encouraged me to go into business for myself with a marketing company. My wife was fully supportive of this, even after we discussed the financial difficulties we would have for the first year or so due to a l limited budget. I made sure she knew that some months, I may not get a check from the business (my salary is paid monthly). 

Her family, however, were not. They accused me of neglecting my family, being lazy, not wanting to work, etc. They would constantly be bringing up the fact that I ""didn't have a job"" because I was always home (working remote). She would defend me, but they would ignore it and continue to call me lazy and a ""deadbeat"" for putting my daughter in daycare while I worked from home. I was still driving a truck part-time to have steady, reliable income but it was only half of what I was making on a good week. 

In the last year however, I have grown my income from my business beyond what I was making in trucking, and have very little overhead. Since we cut costs back when I first started, we realized a lot of things we were paying for, we could do without or found other alternatives and we never really added those expenses back so it's like we have significantly more money now. I still drive a semi occasionally for a friend who owns his truck (mainly to keep my CDL active and stay knowledgable in the industry as a fallback).

Her family has taken note, and they are constantly asking to go out to eat with us, hang out with us, etc then get mad when I never pay for the meals, the outing, the vacation, etc (aside from my part of the tab, obviously). Looking back, I understand why they never had money, they were living well beyond their means, but if it makes them happy then it is what it is. 

I let my wife do whatever she wants with her money (which sometimes includes buying stuff for her family, which I support her doing with her money if that's how she wants to spend it) but I make sure that she knows I don't want a dime of my money going to her family since they were very unsupportive of what made us our money and would go as far as to talk down about me for doing what lead to our money.

Then he calls my son over and whispers in his ear, and I knew it was about the chestnuts.

1jkk319,AmItheAsshole,AITA for yelling at a mom and her kid to get out of my home?,"*There is an update to this on my profile, as I have not been able to post it to the subreddit.*

A few months ago, I (28F) started a new DnD campaign and invited a few friends. One of them, “Sarah”, asked if her friend “Anne” could join. Anne is a mom who doesn’t get many chances to hang out with adults, so I agreed, even though I knew she might be flaky due to childcare responsibilities. I asked Anne if she could attend at least the first few sessions to get familiar with the game, and she agreed.

She then proceeded to cancel, mostly last minute, every proposed first session for the next two months. I told her I'm sorry but if she can't make it to the next proposed session, she won't be in long campaigns (still welcome to join one-shots). She apologized and said she'll make it.

She made it. But brought her toddler without asking.

As soon as they came the kid needed to use the bathroom. He made a mess since he can't fully use an adult toilet yet. I told Anne that's fine but asked her to clean it up. This surprised her and she started being a bit on edge.

We finally sat down at the table and the kid started running around, looking for things to do. I was a bit stressed out by this. Anne noticed and put him in her lap. But now the kid was at the table, which was covered in mini figurines, dice, pretty pictures and maps, most being a choking hazard, along with glasses of various drinks. The kid started fussing about wanting to play with them, I was telling Anne no because it's not safe, she told me he's gentle and doesn't put stuff in his mouth- we bickered while her kid was throwing a tantrum. After the kid knocked over a glass, I loudly asked her to step out into the backyard and calm him down a bit while I make the table safer.

She did, visibly embarrassed, and I removed everything except for plain looking papers, pens and paper cups. I also did my best to calm down as this entire thing stressed me out to hell and back at this point.

They came back and things were fine for a minute. That is, until my dog came out of my bedroom to drink water. Now, I don’t have many house rules, but I have one that’s important: **“Ignore the dog”**, they were informed of that before coming over. The kid spotted her and yelled ""DOGGY"", Anne put him down ""to say hi"", he made a full speed beeline at my dog while making grabbing motions and yelling. I stopped him by stepping out in front of him, he ran into me, fell down and started crying. Anne started screaming at me, I screamed back, and very swiftly told her to get the f out of my home. Sarah was annoyed and told us it took them an hour and a half to get to me, then went with Anne since they carpooled.

The rest stayed, it was awkward for half an hour or so, but we ended up having fun and they even stayed for the night.

I then woke up to the local fb groups and people's instagram stories calling me a controlling asshole, saying I'm ""discriminating"" against various players, being too strict and ""have a dangerous dog"". To add insult to injury, Sarah, who I've been friends with for years, is not speaking to me.

I felt bad and I offered to let him have one that I had been saving for myself...only to discover that what he had thrown away was my lunch. I then got upset at him and told me to ""pick a lane.""","So, every now and then I buy a random frozen meal to keep on hand for lunch emergencies. I had one in the freezer for a month. My husband saw it a few weeks ago and asked if ""that was his"" (because he can't remember anything he buys or adds to the grocery list), and I said, ""No, that's mine.""

Fast forward to yesterday: I hear him nuking something in the kitchen, then he loudly declares it’s ""absolutely disgusting,"" tosses it down the sink, and starts whining about not having lunch. I hadn’t eaten that frozen meal and I did not think I would need it this week, so I thought, “Well, if I let him have it, he’ll have something to eat and I’ll just grab another one next time I’m at the store.” I offer him the meal I was saving. He asks which one, I say ""The white bean chicken chili."" He goes, ""That’s what I just threw away.""

Cue my rage. ""Wait, you took my lunch without asking and then threw it away when you didn’t like it?"" He says, ""You wouldn’t have liked it, it was completely different from chili."" I’m like, ""Yeah, I KNOW, it’s *white bean chicken chili*—it’s not supposed to be like regular chili. That’s why I bought it.""

His response? ""Well, it was disgusting."" I said, ""You didn’t even check what it was, didn’t remember it was mine, and when you didn’t like it, you threw it away instead of asking me about it.""

He goes, ""But you offered it to me."" I reply, ""Yeah, I offered it because I thought you had nothing else. But now that I know you just grabbed my meal without asking, and didn’t even eat it and threw it out instead and did not even ask if I wanted it when you decided you were not going to eat it, I’m a little pissed.""

He then got mad and started telling me I was setting him up, that no matter what he did he was wrong and I was being unreasonable. He told me to ""pick a lane.""

I tried to explain why I was mad and said, ""Imagine you heard me complaining about something I recently bought, and I decided I didn’t like it, so I just threw it away. Then, you have this gift card you’ve been saving for yourself, and you say, ‘You know, I was saving this for myself, but since you already spent your money on something you didn’t like, you can have my gift card to buy something better.’ So, I go, ‘Oh, well, thanks but I already used your gift card to buy the thing I didn’t like and threw away. I saw it lying on the counter, so I just used it.’”

My question is, AITA because I got mad at him after I discovered he ate took my lunch and then threw it away, even though there was a brief moment where he appeared to have nothing to eat for lunch so I offered him mine?

Update:

OP here providing some basic answers:

We have been together nearly 20 years; we are in our late 40s/early 50s (he is older).

Grocery shopping is done like this: I make a list of things I want/need for myself and for recipes I plan on making. He does the same and add them to our communal list. I go to the store and buy everything once a week (same day every week as that is how my schedule allows). He will usually go to the store separately on his own multiple times a week (at least 3 days usually 4) because he wants one specific thing or forgot to add something to the list or ran out of something and buys things for himself; these could be snacks, frozen lunches, or once in a while something we communally ran out of and need ASAP to cook dinner with or something like that.

He usually buys enough frozen meals or relies on leftovers for lunch; I do something similar except most of the time I do not rely on frozen things, I take time to prepare lunch each day (sandwich, omelette, random snacks, leftovers). Every week when I do the grocery shopping I plan what I am having that week for lunches and ensure I buy the things I need. The frozen things I buy usually 1 of to keep on hand in an emergency - such as I have no time to prepare a lunch and need to quickly throw something in the microwave. That is why I tend to buy just one every once in a while and it sits there like a spare tire in the trunk of the car. Also, I tend to always buy something that I know he won't enjoy, to deter him from eating it because he will just eat whatever is there even if I say ""oh hey I was saving that."" I have to do the same with snacks - if I buy a bag if chips or a box of crackers he will just plow through it in a day. My work around there is to either not buy snack food for myself, or go to extremes to find things he will not eat, like the one flavor he hates.

This happens a lot. Like I buy a certain type of protein bar that I use during my workouts and he will eat them like they are candy bars and then when I go to grab one for my workout - empty box. And if I ask him to please make sure he replaces them if he is going to eat them all, he gets angry and says he ""should not have to ration food."" I told him it was not rationing, it was simply making sure that if I buy something for a specific meal or purpose for myself, that I expect it to be there when I need it. This is an ongoing debate between us, and I am trying to not turn it into a hill to die on.

As to history - he most likely has undiagnosed ADD (we're older GenX, these things were not recognized as often when we were growing up). He has all the classic signs. He is also academically brilliant and can often block everything out (Sounds, things in his visual line of sight) when he is laser focused on something that is cognitively engaging. So he very likely forgot that I said it was mine. However, he could have read the label clearly; also it had been in the freezer for a month so I assumed he knew that was my backup emergency lunch.

Finally - when he does not like the taste of something he does tend to overreact in a very dramatic way, like gagging/screaming as if one was being poisoned as opposed to just quietly going ""gross...not going to eat this."" I sometimes wonder if he is also on the spectrum because has has quite visceral yet unusual reactions to very specific situations, such as when the smoke alarm goes off, when he does not like the taste of something...whereas I would just deal he has a rather over the top reaction.",10365,0.97,10365,0,10696.0,331.0,945,1741832433.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ja1n9k/aita_my_husband_made_himself_a_frozen_meal_for/,False,True
1heq2dn,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not defending a girl I barely know after she was kicked out of the friend group for asking to be paid?,"I (21f) have a group of 6 friends. 2 months ago, a new girl (Jane-22f) was introduced to the group.

For context, one thing our friend group does is ‘trade’ services. For example, I’ll do one of my friend’s nails for free and she’ll do my hair for free when I need it doing in the future. We generally try to keep the trades within the same price range. For example, if my hair costs £60, I’ll trade doing nails for £60-£70. Anything over £10 is usually paid on top of the free service (if my hair costs £60 and the nails are £100, my friend will pay me £40).

To be clear, there is ZERO obligation to do these trades and to my knowledge, no one has been pressured into one. It’s all about favours and doing nice things for your friends.

Anyways, Jane joins the group 2ish months ago and immediately starts asking about my nails. At one point, she says she can’t afford to get hers done right now so I asked her if she wanted to do a trade. Jane makes her own t shirts/clothing/accessories. The nails I ended up doing on her cost £160. When it was my turn to pick clothes/accessories, I ended up leaving with about £70 worth. I told her not to worry about ‘paying’ me back with the £90. All in all, I thought it was a good experience and I got to talk to Jane one-on-one. It was fun.

Until Wednesday (the 11th of December). I get a text from Jane apologising and saying she realised she can’t afford to just ‘give away’ £70 worths of her stuff and she needs me to pay her asap or she needs the stuff back. At first, I’m really confused because I could not have been more clear about the how the trades work and I never forced her into one. I apologised back to her but said I didn't have some of the smaller items as I planned to gift them to my sister for her birthday. Jane then kept telling me to just 'pay her back'. I said I would when I get paid from my job.

The issue then became her texting. She went to our group chat to complain about me not paying her for the clothes she gave me. She ended up letting it slip it was a trade and everyone told her she can't back out of a deal weeks after it happened. She ended up taking to tiktok to complain about how I 'stole' from her and am refusing to pay her back. In response, she was kicked out of the friend group.

However now the group is split. Half say I should have just paid her as she does seem to be genuinely struggling, while the other half say I am under no obligation to pay her due to the agreed terms of the trade. The first group think I'm kind of an asshole and Jane definitely thinks I am... so AITA?

EDIT: some people are questioning how my nails cost £160. I do custom sets that involve hours of art/'construction' (of charms, stamps, etc).

1iawnhv,AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving a party because my date refused to get me water?,"I had been seeing someone I met through mutual friends. We’d had good times one-on-one, and when he invited me to events with his friends, I’d contribute to the group dynamic by never showing up empty handed and offering to grab drinks for others.

Fast forward to a holiday-themed party with his friends. My date and I planned to meet there and hang out afterward. I spent the day cleaning my condo and preparing mulled wine to bring. During the party, people were getting drinks for one another, including me when I served the wine.

At one point, I was sitting on the couch, blocked in by only my date on one said and many others on my other side. I was tired and didn’t feel like tightly squeezing past people I didn’t know, so I asked my date if he could grab me a glass of water. He shook his head and after I said “huh” he said, “No. I was just up, and you could’ve asked before I sat down again.” I was taken aback because I view small gestures, like grabbing water, as basic acts of care for friends, but especially for someone you’re dating.

That moment, combined with a long day of preparation, left me feeling drained. Since the party was winding down and I didn’t have the energy to engage further, I said my goodbyes and called a ride. My date offered to walk me out and said he felt hurt that I was leaving. I explained I needed to recharge but that he was welcome to come over after the party.

As we walked out, I jokingly mentioned how him not getting me water surprised me. He replied, “Wow, that really upset you, huh? I have to be guarded about these things, you know.”

Later, we texted, but he seemed more upset about me leaving than interested in listening to why I felt drained. When I tried to call, he didn’t answer. His texts were curt, and I eventually told him I’d let him decompress. Two days later, I called to discuss what happened. He said he’d call that evening but didn’t reach out until three days later, saying, “I’m not dodging you, I’ve just been busy.” At that point, I was over it, especially since he never acknowledged the misunderstanding or my attempts to resolve it.

A month later, we finally had a conversation. He explained that getting me water felt “subservient” and was something I had to earn through time and “being in the trenches with him.” He also said I didn’t understand how busy his life was (for context, I work multiple jobs). I calmly explained that grabbing water for someone isn’t about being subservient but a small act of kindness.

After reflecting, I feel his responses and handling of the situation were disrespectful and indicative of bigger issues.

So, is there an asshole here? I appreciate the perspective.",10350,0.96,10350,0,10800.0,450.0,898,1737942495.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iawnhv/aita_for_leaving_a_party_because_my_date_refused/,False,True
1mc5zrg,AmItheAsshole,AITA For telling my sister that her lack of personal hygiene is the real reason no job will hire her and not sexism?,"This concerns my sister “Lily” who is graduating soon. Our parents taught us the importance of personal hygiene and keeping yourself presentable. But I guess Lily fell off the wagon while dorming in college because it feels like she dropped everything to do with personal hygiene since moving back home.



It’s easier to explain with a list of things she isn’t taking care of:



Hair: Very oily/greasy and always tangled from lack of wash and brushing.



Skin: Also very oily/greasy from no wash.



Nails: Never trims so they’re long and yellow from grime.



Clothes: Clothes themselves are nice but she leaves them sloppy/wrinkled.



Body: Showers once a week tops. I’m not sensitive to smell, but my sister REEKS and honestly makes me gag sometimes.



Lily is upset because she says she can’t get an in-person job in her field and wants to give up. Our parents have tried telling her that presentability/hygiene is as important as credentials when getting jobs, but my sister won’t listen. Lily has a rocky relationship with our family so she takes it as a personal attack rather than them trying to help.



Lily is now blaming sexism and says men are all just intimidated by a competent woman and that’s the sole reason why she hasn’t gotten a job. If she wants to lie to herself, it’s her life. Whatever. What I can’t stand is her trying to make it my problem and expect validation from me.



Lily just did a bunch interviews, but all went cold after and none panned out into jobs. She was venting to me last week about how companies in this field are all boys’ clubs and quick to shoot down a woman they know is intellectually above them. I was basically just like good for you, can I please finish my session in peace now?



Lily got defensive and said she’s just warning me. Then doubled down saying most men are selfish and I should save myself the headache now. She was saying this with my male friends on the voice call.



I had enough and told Lily that her lack of personal hygiene is the real reason no job will hire her, so stop blaming others and think for two seconds: If you were a company owner who needs to impress investors to keep your own family afloat, would you want to be represented by someone who looks and smells like a homeless person, or someone who is presentable and takes care of themselves? 



We got into an argument and Lily is now either giving me one-word answers or not saying anything to me at all. I’ll be honest that we argue a lot but Lily normally would have gotten over it by now. Did I do the right thing giving Lola a dose of reality or did I fuck up here?

1inpqxa,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not moving out of the way after someone deliberately walked infront of me after seeing me,"So today I (24f, 5'2"") was on the way home from work and walked down the stairs to the underpass to get to my train track. *Since I was a kid I was taught to stick to the right side.* I was so far on the right side, that the wall was literally next to me. While moving down the stairs I see an old man (60ish) on *(my left/his right)* side like 20 meters away, we make eye contact and he starts moving to the (his left) side where I was walking through. Weird, I think, but I have recently started to not move out of the way when I am walking on the most right side, so I kept walking, wall barely touching my shoulder. He moves right in front of me, I keep refusing to move until he is right in front of me and blocks me. Now, the underpass is a good 10 meters wide, so he wouldve still had plenty of space to move around. I still refuse to move out of the way and also come to a stop. He stared at me for a few seconds, before ***touching my right shoulder***, unsuccsefully trying to push me away saying ""Attention Madam"". I look at him, smile, before also putting my hand on his shoulder, mimicking him and gently push him away saying ""Attention, sir"" at this point his smug grin turned to him looking dumbfounded as he finally moved away. But not without calling me an asshole. 

*I want to add that he walked completely normal and we were nowhere close the stairs anymore to which he wouldve needed the railing. We were also almost the only two people in the underpass*

AITA? 

Edit: I forgot to mention that I live in Switzerland. Also he started out on (my left his right) side of the underpass so he crossed a few meters over before ending up in my path. Also, I obviously do move for people with mobility issues or cant move around freely? The rule of not moving concerns people that are just as capable of moving as I am.

1mkirpx,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for refusing to take my shoes off in my friend’s house, causing his wife to cancel the DnD session for everyone?","*Posting this on a throwaway because my friends know my main.*

I (38M) was invited to a DnD session with 4 other people at my friend Alex’s (34M) house. When I got there, his wife answered the door and immediately asked me to take my shoes off because they have a strict no-shoes policy due to them having a crawling baby.

I explained that I have a medical condition called epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), which makes the skin on my feet extremely fragile. Even mild friction or pressure can cause painful blisters and tears, so I have to wear supportive shoes with cushioned orthopedic insoles at all times, even indoors. Walking barefoot or just in socks causes me pain and can lead to bleeding.

She suggested I put grocery bags or socks over my shoes, but I told her that’s unsafe for walking and honestly just insulting. She said she “can’t compromise her baby’s health for my comfort.” When Alex came to the door, he told me to “just deal with it for a couple hours” or I wasn’t welcome inside. I told him I wasn’t going to risk injuring myself over a DnD session, and if my shoes were that big of an issue, I’d respectfully leave.

As I walked back to my car, I overheard his wife telling the other guests that were already there that the night was “off” because I “made a huge scene at the door.” Later, I got a group text from Alex saying he was canceling DnD night because “it’s not fair to expect everyone else to pretend nothing happened.”

Some mutual friends say I overreacted and could’ve just sucked it up, while others think Alex and his wife were ridiculous for ruining everyone else's plans just because I decided not to stay.

So, AITA?

**TL;DR:** I have a medical condition (EBS) that means I have to wear shoes indoors to protect my feet. My friend’s wife demanded I take my shoes off during DnD night for their crawling baby’s sake. I told them I would not participate and they ended up canceling the whole session.

  
**Edit:** I should add that I texted our friend group chat a few days ago about my concerns with my condition because we changed the location of the meetup to his house instead of mine. Alex reassured me that I shouldn't worry about it, so I didn't bring my indoor shoes.",10285,0.73,10285,0,16322.0,6037.0,10233,1754618345.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mkirpx/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_shoes_off_in_my/,False,True
1lekujs,AmItheAsshole,AITA for moving into a studio apartment away from my mother-in-law who moved in?,"Long story short, my boyfriend's mom is poor and had to move in to my boyfriend and I's apartment last month because my boyfriend's brother (who lived with her) got them both evicted. He stole her car and wrecked it into their apartment and almost killed someone. He's currently in rehab and before she moved in, I sat down with my boyfriend and laid out the requirements of her living here: she must cut off contact with his brother for his own good and never invite him over, as I'm afraid of him retaliating at our apartment and getting us evicted too, and she should stop enabling him with a constant safety net to continue his drug use (I know that sounds harsh but it was the only way to actually force him to get help, this has been an almost decade-long battle of her enabling him and he's not getting any better). My boyfriend agreed to this and she agreed. Cut to two weeks in, I come home from work. My boyfriend and her are laughing about how they took his brother to Golden Corral when I was gone and he was so high he was nodding off in the food. I was so upset that not only did she break the cardinal rule that I set for her but that my boyfriend went along with it and did it too. I told him I felt betrayed and that he just set a precedent to her that she can do whatever she wants now because any rule set isn't actually going to be enforced, clearly by his example. He told me he did it because he thought it was too harsh after the fact without telling me he had changed his mind, and thereby going against our agreement. I otherwise wouldn't have let her live here rent-free. My boyfriend said putting her on the street was too harsh of a punishment for breaking the rules, but isn't that the point? Now she's telling us we need to do HER chores when we pay the rent, because she doesn't want to do them, knowing he won't enforce or kick her out because he ultimately can't face the guilt of doing so. He has attachment issues with her and a heavy guilt complex.

Our apartment lease is up in a couple months and now that we're moving, she asked us ""So where are WE moving to?"" fully expecting a free-ride and free rent at our next place. I was so dumbfounded because she is only supposed to be here until she got housing, but low income housing waiting lists can be months to years long. I don't want to live with her anymore because she walks all over us and causes tension between my boyfriend and I. He will never put her on the street because he's controlled by his guilt. When I asked what he plans to do, he said he isn't taking her to our next place, but that would ultimately leave her on the street and I know deep down even if we initially move without her, she will be back in a week or two because he'll feel guilty. 

I want to move into a studio apartment now knowing that I don't believe he's going to let her go, and I've voiced this as a real possibility to him, but I'm being framed as trying to dismantle our relationship. AITA?

UPDATE: So it's been a few months and I still can't believe what an overwhelming response this post got. Needless to say you guys completely changed my life so thank you. I went ahead and got my own place when our lease ended. He got his own place about half an hour away and his mom managed to get accepted at an apartment of her own. I do genuinely hope her the best regardless of what happened but I don't keep in touch with her at all anymore. My bf and I decided that we should take some time apart and see other people, but we still keep in touch and he's always going to be someone that's important to me (I just think the limit of our relationship all along was friendship and not romantic, and that's okay). His brother has since been charged with some stuff and is in prison so that whole dynamic has changed as well. Having him out of the picture has been very emotional for everyone and again, I hope being in prison gets him the help he needs and he stays sober (he's not a bad person, just very misguided). Lastly, I've been exploring this new city on my own and trying my best to make new connections/discover things about myself, and this is my first time really socializing on my own since the pandemic so it's very liberating. I might've met someone special too 😏 but we're taking our time because I don't want to rush things, but none of this would've been possible without such unanimous support so thank you guys so much, I truly mean it 💖 ",10224,0.95,10224,0,10792.0,568.0,1768,1750262424.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lekujs/aita_for_moving_into_a_studio_apartment_away_from/,False,True

We’ve studied together a few times, and I shared my annotated notes with him before a big exam. I made them myself, with diagrams, explanations, and even some mnemonics I came up with.

A few weeks later, one of our professors used one of my made-up mnemonics in a lecture, crediting “an anonymous student.” I was confused. Turns out Jake had submitted my notes (with his name on them) to the prof’s “student tips” portal, where students can share study tips for extra credit. He didn’t even mention me.

I confronted him, he brushed it off and said, “It’s just notes, chill.” So I reported it to the academic honesty office, since it technically falls under plagiarism. Now he’s under investigation and might lose the extra credit — or worse.

1km0znf,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to give up my life insurance payout and asking my ex’s family to refinance the car he left me?,"So my ex passed away recently in a work-related accident. It’s sad, of course. I have a lot of mixed emotions about it. But the truth is, we hadn’t been together in over a year when it happened. We were together for five years, and we broke up because he cheated on me and got someone else pregnant. That breakup wrecked me. It took me a long time to recover. I haven’t seen him since.

After the breakup, I went no contact. I’ve spent the past year healing, learning to be happy again, and moving on. I didn’t go to the funeral. I didn’t want to see the baby mama or his family. And while I’m not happy he’s gone, I can’t say I’m devastated anymore either. I grieved this person when I left the relationship.

Now here’s where things get complicated.

Six months after our breakup, and **after**   the baby was born, he took out a life insurance policy. In it, he named me as the 50% beneficiary. His mom and the baby mama each got 25%. I didn’t know this until the insurance company called me. I assumed it was some paperwork leftover from when we were together. But nope this was a new policy, dated well *after* the breakup. That means this was his decision.

At the same time, there’s a car. He financed it while we were still together, but it’s under *my name and credit.* I begged him for **over a year** to refinance it, to the point the only reason I ever contacted him was for the refinancing of that car. He never refinanced that car, I doubt he was ever going to. Now that he’s gone, it’s still tied to me. The car is sitting in my garage, and his family has reached out saying the baby mama needs it for work. I told them, fine. You can have it as soon as it’s refinanced and no longer on *my credit.* I will **GLADLY** sign whatever paper they need. But I am not going to risk my credit on people I don’t trust to make payments.

And now they’re demanding that I give up the life insurance payout too. That I should “do the right thing” and give it to his mom or the baby mama. But here’s the thing, *I didn’t ask for any of this.* I didn’t ask to be put on that policy. He made that choice, after everything that happened between us.

Honestly?

I feel like I *earned* that money. I spent five years with that man. Five years dealing with the stress, the gaslighting, the emotional pain, the betrayal. I loved him deeply and I lost so much trying to make that relationship work. I stayed with him until *I found out* his baby mama was pregnant, because he was *actively hiding it from me* at that time. I was with him through the worst parts of his life. If anything, this money feels like the only thing I ever got back from all the bullshit. He chose to leave it to me. Probably because deep down, he knew how badly he treated me.

1l2j2zu,AmItheAsshole,AITA for blowing up at my parents for something my adult sister did?,"I (26F) have a sister, “Amy” (28F), who has always had a difficult relationship with food. She was bullied as a kid and turned to food for comfort. As an adult, she still struggles with self-control, especially around things she finds appetizing. Our parents have never set boundaries with her around food, and that’s carried into adulthood—she currently lives with them, and they do all the grocery shopping and cooking.

My husband (28M) recently had a birthday, and I planned a surprise party. I sent him out of the house for a few hours so I could set up and asked my parents to come help. I specifically asked them not to bring Amy setting up involved putting out snacks, drinks, and a homemade cake with frosting.

They showed up with Amy anyway, saying it wouldn’t be fair to exclude her. I gave her a few small tasks and specifically asked her not to touch any of the food until guests arrived, but I was too busy to keep a constant eye on her.

At one point, I went into the kitchen and found Amy with the fridge open, eating the frosting out of the mixing bowl. She had eaten nearly half of it. As soon as she saw me, she burst into tears and said she only meant to try a little but couldn’t stop.

My parents heard us and came in. My mom said it wasn’t that big of a deal since the cake was untouched and I still had enough frosting for a crumb coat, but I had planned to do specific cake decorations, and now there wasn’t enough frosting; I didn’t have the time or ingredients to make more. My dad suggested going to the store to buy a tub of pre-made frosting, saying it was the same thing. I explained my husband tries to avoid a lot of the ingredients found in store-bought frosting and wouldn’t want that. My dad said to just not tell him since he “wouldn’t even know the difference“. 

That suggestion was super frustrating to me. I told my parents that they couldn't convince me that this was no big deal, and that they had allowed this by not setting boundaries with Amy’s binge eating and by bringing her to set up. They told me to back off and be more sensitive to my sister, and that it wasn’t her fault. I responded by saying that I was more angry at them, because at least Amy felt bad while they were trying to downplay the situation. 

They got upset and said it wasn’t fair to blame them for Amy’s choices, and that she was an adult and they can’t control her. They also said that they were trying to help by giving suggestions, and that I was being stubborn by shutting all of them down. They ended up leaving, and now they’re giving me the silent treatment, even though Amy has apologized for eating the frosting.

Husband (28M) absolutely adores him and wants to spend every available moment with him. I know he wants to be an amazing father, however he enganges in unsafe behaviors like falling asleep on the couch while baby is contact napping, leaving baby on the playmat unattended while the dog is in the room or putting baby for a day nap with his bib still on.

Husband claims I'm too anxious, making a big deal out of nothing - baby can't roll yet and the dog won't hurt him, he holds baby firmly while sleeping etc. And I admit I don't react calmly and freak out, which makes him act defensive. But he is being unsafe and it stresses me out. I feel like I can't leave him alone with the baby which only offends him more.

Kylie has a physical disability, she struggles with fine motor tasks - and has a slight tremor in her hands when holding objects. Because of this, our mother stated that she did not want Kylie to hold the baby - ever. She kept saying how K's ""hands can't be trusted"" and that it would be best if she just looked at the baby. 


But K was so excited to meet her new niece that I decided it was worth trying. With some assistance from me, she was able to hold her without issue. When our mother saw it happening, she was not happy. She said that it was irresponsible of me and repeated that Kylie's ""hands can't be trusted"" around the baby.

I had a child tell me that she doesn't drink cocoa and asked for just a cup of whipped cream. (Note she and her friends were the first in line. ) As she ate the chocolate chip cookies, I'm fairly certain it wasn't an allergy to chocolate, just a preference to not drink cocoa.  As soon as she asked, the five other kids wanted to have just a cup of the whipped cream too. So I could see where this would end up.  So I told her no,  that I was sorry,  I only had a limited supply of the whipped cream and if I told her yes I'd have to let everyone do it too and the people behind her in line wouldn't have the cream to add to their cocoa.  I offered her a cup to grab some water, but she stomped away mad.  Five minutes later, her mom came up and asked for a cup of whipped cream, and there was another immediate chorus of people wanting cups of whipped cream too. So I explained again about the whipping cream and the people in line, and mom stomped away mad.  A teacher who was attending the event with her child and not connected to the class or parent group (only add a child in the class) came up and asked,  with the predictable round of ""me too"". I again explained as there is still a line out the door and down the hall,  and only having a certain amount of whipped cream available, if I say yes to this child, I'll have to let everyone get cups of cream too, so I was sorry,  but the answer is no.  When this unconnected teacher caught me with my back turned, she took the whipped cream anyway and gave it to the child.  Which started an avalanche of folks wanting the same thing.  So I kept having to say no,  sorry,  no for the next 45 minutes until everyone had made it through the line.

1hh4wyb,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for calling someone out of their white-elephant gift, that was significantly under the spending criteria?","A social group that I'm a part of held a white-elephant gift exchange last night.  Participation was by absolutely no means mandatory or even expected.  The event was divided up between two pricing tiers; under $25 - $50 and $75 - $100.  The majority of members went with the less expensive tier for obvious reasons, and there's absolutely no *stigma* within our circle for doing so.  In fact only 9 out of our nearly forty members chose the more expensive tier, myself included.

Well I was picked to go 3rd and I selected a gift that was wrapped quite beautifully, thinking that was a good sign, but I was disappointed to discover the gift was a hot chocolate set that certainly wouldn't have met the criteria of the lower range, let alone the one we were participating in.  I could tell the others in the group felt roughly the same just by the looks on their face, and my focus was directed to one woman (Jen) who was looking away, clearly embarrassed.  As you might imagine, no one took my gift.

Now I know its petty not to be happy with what you're given, but let's be honest here in saying that Jen was throwing in the sort of thing you'd find on clearance at Walmart knowing full well she'd walk away with something pricey in turn.  In this case, Jen wound up with brand new Keurig.

I *discreetly* pulled our social group's leader aside and mentioned my concern to her.  She expressed she wasn't happy with this herself and that she'd even tried to tell Jen not to participate with the more expensive tier because it was well known that Jen wasn't doing great financially, but Jen had sworn up and down that it wouldn't be an issue.

We didn't want to disrupt events, so I was asked to put on a kind face and to avoid talking about the gift for the remainder of the evening, which I accepted as people were trying to have fun.

This morning I received a long winded text chain from Jen, expressing how frustrated she was that I'd demeaned her by complaining about her gift.  She went on and on about how nice it must be that I can simply throw my money away while others, like her, are struggling, and that her income shouldn't mean she can't have nice things.  Instead of fighting, I forwarded the texts to our group leader, and I've since received word that Jen would no longer be a member of our social group.

Now, if I'm being honest, I do genuinely feel bad because I know how happy being a member of this group made Jen.  She has had a lot of setbacks in her life.  I do not hate her or hold any negative feelings for her at all.  I simply felt she was knowingly taking advantage of the rest of us to basically trade up beyond her means.

AITA?

  
Edit: So some additional details have emerged in the days since my post.  Apparently, our club's leader had never even had the opportunity to speak with Jen following my conversation with her.  Instead, Jen was riled up by other group members messaging her following the party, accusing her of taking advantage of the situation.  So when Jen messaged me in the morning, it was on the assumption that I had been going around talking poorly about her, when in reality I'd only expressed my concerns to the club's leadership.

When our club's leader (btw, I say leader because AITA's bot does not like you saying pr3zident) called her following me forwarding the text chain, Jen was amped up for a fight and was hostile from the very second she answered the call.  After a lot great deal of insults and cursing from Jen, our leader then decided that she should no longer be welcome in our group going forward.



Also, some people have expressed concern over why I say ""leader"".  This is because AITA's bot will automatically flag a conversation with pr3zident in it.

1ies40z,AmItheAsshole,AITA for kicking out my mom’s boyfriend?,"When I was 17 my mom came into money.  She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad’s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister’s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house.

Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn’t pay anything but he did work.

When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed.

Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey.

For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven’t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid.

He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She’s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit.

I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom’s past relationship as an adult was pathetic.

I hollered for my mom’s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn’t know what he current thing thought but I wasn’t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn’t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just “being kind” letting me stay.

First that isn’t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn’t that’s on him.

I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn’t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week).

Our first child was born in October, and we decided to turn the guest room into his nursery. We thought about sacrificing the office instead, but decided we needed it more than the guest room. I work on-site, but I also do some freelancing from home, and my husband works hybrid. We don’t need to do our work from the office, but it’s more comfortable and less chaotic, especially now that we have a baby. On the other hand, we rarely have guests over. If we do, the office is big enough to set a mattress ***(edit: a normal one, not an air mattress)*** on the floor.

My father lives in a different country. He’s traveling here for Christmas in about a week, and this will be his first time meeting my son in person. Last time he came, I was pregnant and we still had the guest room, so he stayed there during his visit.

A couple weeks ago, my father called to ask whether he could stay at my apartment again this year. I said sure, but we don’t have the guest room anymore, so he’d have to sleep in the office. He asked what I meant, and I told him we’d turned the guest room into the baby’s nursery.

He then asked why I hadn’t gotten rid of the office instead. I explained my and my husband’s reasoning. My father got annoyed and said, “Whatever, I’ll get a hotel”, before hanging up on me.

The next day, my father texted me. He said it was selfish and inconsiderate of me and my husband to keep an office we “don’t actually need” over a room to properly house potential guests. He added that he didn’t raise me to be such an awful hostess, and it’s insane of me to think people would be okay sleeping on a mattress on the floor.

My sister is siding with my father, and I’m starting to doubt myself here.

1l4ukuf,AmItheAsshole,AITA for loosing weight for my friends wedding although I’m already the “skinny friend”?,"I (F28) recently lost a fair bit of weight and now my friend (F30) is saying I’m trying to upstage her at her wedding. My best friend “Emily” got engaged at the end of last year and asked me to be a bridesmaid, I was super happy and of course said yes. 

In the past 3 years I have put on some weight, about two dress sizes, it didn’t really bother me until recently so I decided to use the wedding as an excuse to loose some weight. I just find it easier to do if I have a goal and end date.

This past weekend we were bridesmaid dress shopping and Emily was acting kind of weird towards me, giving me funny looks and talking over me. The two other bridesmaids (one I’m friends with the other I don’t know very well) didn’t seem to notice so I brushed it off thinking she was just stressed. 

Me and Emily live really close to each other so usually after something like this we would hang out for the day at one of our houses. At the end of the appointment I asked her who’s house she wanted to go to and she scoffed and told me she was going home. I asked what was wrong and this is when she went off on me. 

I don’t remember word for word what she said because I was so confused and shocked. But these are the bits I remember- she basically said it was clear I was trying to loose weight to upstage her for her wedding, that I was already “the skinny friend” and now I’m just trying to make it all about me especially as I never cleared my weigh loss with her. She said I clearly knew what I was doing was wrong because I was still wearing oversized clothes to disguise my weight loss - I just haven’t updated my wardrobe and prefer to be comfortable over wearing tight fitting stuff. 

I don’t consider myself skinny but I am the smallest out of the four of us, I also didn’t think about how changing my appearance would affect her vision for her wedding. I’ve never been a bridesmaid before so I don’t know if that was something I should have considered? 

So I don’t think I’m the AH for loosing the weight - unless I am? 
But AITH for not telling her I was going to loose weight? 

EDIT: guys I now know it’s LOSE I’m sorry for my dyslexia, I would go and edit all of them out but 1. I have been told there are many I’m too lazy for that and 2. I now think it’s hilarious how annoying you all seem to find it 

UPDATE:
First off thanks for all the support as well as all the spelling lessons they have cheered me up a lot.
 Not sure if anyone wanted an update but you’re getting one anyway. 
I called my my friend as I’m currently away for work so couldn’t meet face to face. 

Spoiler, it did not go well. 

I started by telling her it was not my intent to make her feel any kind of way and tried to explain I had already been on my weight loss journey before she got engaged. I asked her if she really thought that I would be vindictive enough to try and upstage her at her wedding. Apparently this was the wrong thing to say. 
She started ranting about how I think I’m better than her, how whenever we go out together no one ever looks at her only at me. (I don’t think this is true as she is very pretty and I’m pretty average looking). 

Here’s where it gets bonkers bananas. She told me that her ex boyfriend (who recently got married) is going to be at the wedding and for a while he was thinking of leaving his (at the time) fiancé to ask me out but my friend convinced him not to. 
I had no idea any of this went on and would have been appalled because 1. That’s just weird and 2. He’s my best friend’s ex and I’m now pretty sure she’s still in love with him. 

I have been uninvited from the wedding “unless I put the weight back on, then I can come but not as a bridesmaid” 
Safe to say I now have a new motivation to keep the weight off and shall not be attending any weddings in the near future. 

She’s always had a temper and has flipped out at me over random stuff before but nothing ever this insane. I guess I’m going to have to get better at identifying red flags.

1ivwpqc,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my friend to give back a gift I gave her after she openly expressed that she would be getting rid of it?,"I (27 F) have been friends with this girl (we'll call her Mary- 28 F) since high-school. Recently I was back in our hometown and she invited me to her birthday brunch to celebrate her 28th b-day. One day on my way home I happened to stumble across an estate sale where I found a set of really nice, crystal champagne glasses that were in really good condition and cheaper than their worth. Mary lives a high quality fancy lifestyle, so I thought they would be perfect for her, especially because they were within my budget (at the time I had been recovering from student loans and just put down a deposit on my first apartment in the city).

Fast forward to the brunch, we had a really good time and I got to catch up with Mary and other friends from high-school. Mary was eager to open the presents, and when she got to mine, she seemed to enjoy them, asking me where I got them since there was no label. I explained that I didn't know the brand, but the person running the estate sale had assured me that they were authentic and had been a wedding gift to the previous owners. At the mention of the estate sale, Mary became visibly disgusted. Although she didn't say anything to my face, she was very passive aggressive towards me for the rest of the afternoon. I overheard her whispering to some of the other guests about how I had the audacity to give her a used item and that she would be discarding them later.

  
After the event was over, I approached her privately, not wanting to make a scene and asked that if she wasn't going to use the glasses, if she could give them back as I would put them to good use and know their quality. She flipped out and told me it was extremely rude to ask for them back and it was not my business what she did with them.

My family is understanding and thinks that I did nothing wrong, but some mutual friends also at the event think otherwise.

To that she looked really confused and told me how she couldn’t afford plane tickets and she wanted to drive. 

I was sorta confused because if she can’t afford a $150 plane ticket how was she planning to pay for the activities and places SHE wants to go (Nobu, jetskiing, shopping, clubs etc) which all add up quickkk. She also doesn’t have her license which means I would have to do all the driving which would be hard as I have bad back issues and driving for so long would be painful.

She kinda just laughed and said since I have money she assumed I would pay for a majority of her expenses. I was shocked because why would she assume I would pay for her expenses without even asking? I have no problem covering something like drinks or ice cream but to assume I would pay for everything by myself except for the hotel? (we had previously agreed to split the hotel 50/50)

I told her that this trip was her idea and she shouldn’t have asked me to go if she was expecting me to pay for everything. She’s upset and complaining about how it’s unfair since I can afford to pay for her, AITA?

UPDATE! I told her for her to invite me on a trip then assume i’d cover expenses like this was ridiculous. As for now, I’m just gonna cut back and let our friendship fizzle off. We’ve been friends for years but this was childish and out of line.

1iy29sn,AmItheAsshole,"WIBTA if I don't ""share"" the inheritance that I received from a friend with her daughter?","I (F32) recently came into an inheritance when my neighbor and close friend, Valorie (F68), died. I met Valorie when I moved into my condo in 2018 and she became my next door neighbor. Our places are on the top floor and have almost connecting balconies.

We used to spend every Saturday morning outside taking care of our plant babies and chatting. I had learned that Valorie had been a widow since she was 55. I got the impression that she had married young and never had a true chance to learn who she was until after Garry had died.

I had always thought that Valorie was alone in the world. Turns out that Valorie had had one child, a daughter, Sam (F44). However, they had been estranged since the early 2000's. The story that Valorie told me was that Sam had come out as gay when she was just out of high school. That did not sit well with Garry. He told Sam that she was no longer his daughter and kicked her out; telling her to never contact them or come home again. The whole situation broke Valorie's heart and it was her biggest regret in life. She told me that she had always wished she had tried to fight for Sam, but in the moment she was so shocked that she watched the whole thing happen without saying a word.

When I had first heard that story, I asked if she had ever tried to reach out. Valorie told me that she hadn't because she didn't know how to even try. So I did some internet sleuthing and found Sam on Facebook. It turns out that Sam had managed to build a good life for herself.

I helped Valorie draft a heartfelt message to Sam. Valorie apologized for everything and told Sam how much her perspectives had changed over the years. Valorie also asked if they could try and build a new relationship. We sent the message and saw that Sam had seen and maybe read the message, but Sam never responded.

About a month ago, I got home from work to find Valorie passed away on her balcony. She had suffered an embolism. I sent the link to her obituary and memorial page to Sam. I didn't see Sam at the funeral. There is a lawyer handling all of Valorie's affairs. I thought that I would simple grieve the loss of my friend and eventually would have a new neighbor.

I never expected me to be the only person who Valorie mentioned in her will. Let alone to have been left everything.

A few days ago Sam messaged me. She was upset and demanded that I give her Valorie's things. Claiming that I took advantage of an old widow. I was upset when I first read Sam's message and thought, ""who does she think she is? She hasn't spoken to Valorie in literal decades and never responded when Valorie tried to reach out. Now Valorie is her mother and that entitles her to Valorie's stuff?""

Now I wonder if I should do something for Sam. I go back and forth if Valorie would want me to. Valorie knew where Sam was, so she could have included Sam somehow.

The lawyer I talked to said that the inheritance is completely mine and that Sam has no claim, but should I give Sam something?

UPDATE:

Thank you to everyone who has commented and giving me the outside perspective that I needed. I'm shocked at the volume of people who have reacted to this. I was really only hoping to have a handful of responses to help me think. I do want to clarify some things that I wasn't able to in the original post due to the character limits.

I first want to address the timeline of events:

* Sam was kicked out in the early 2000's. I think it was in 2002.
* Garry died in 2011.
* Valorie sold the ""family home"" and downsized to her condo in 2013, because the house was too big for just her.
* I moved in to my condo in 2018.
* I learned about Sam, Valorie wrote the letter, and we sent it to Sam in 2022.
* Valorie retired and had her will and estate set up in the end of 2023.
* Valorie died on January 23, 2025.
* The funereal was on January 31, 2025. I messaged Sam as soon as the funeral arrangements were finalized.
* Sam messaged me this past Sunday on February 23, 2025.

To clarify some questions that people had about the estate. It's currently in the formal probate process. Valorie was a legal secretary for a family law office and the lawyer she worked with specialized in estate law. She had a full carrier there and as part of her retirement package that lawyer helped her set up her will and take care of the estate. This is the lawyer who told me that everything is being done by the book, that everything will be fully settled in a few months, and that all of Valorie's wishes are being carried out to the letter.

I have taken reddit's advice and will be speaking to a different lawyer about both my legal interests in the estate and how to communicate with Sam. I still haven't responded to her, because I haven't been sure how. Her initial message was extremely harsh and attacking and that is what triggered that first emotional and protective response in me. I'm trying to take reddit's advice and be empathetic to Sam's situation. However, that is challenging because Sam has continued to send me a few additional messages demanding that I respond and calling me a ""heartless bitch"" and ""homophobic bigot"" among other things. I'm not going to respond until after I've talked to that lawyer and can do it in the right way.

I do think that reddit is right and that if Sam wants any sentimental items that she should have them because they might help her healing. I do want to be clear that the estate is not very big and is very simple. All that Valorie had was her condo and her car. That car was more valuable to her than it is on the market. It's a 2014 model of a daily-driver.

I hold the spare key to Valories condo and have been in to clear out the kitchen and to take care of her plant babies, because I can't bare to see them die too. It's been really strange being in that space without her. I've been given permission start cleaning out the condo, but not to get rid of anything. I'm going to spend this weekend going threw her things and organizing them into boxes. I don't know what type of sentimental item's that I'll find, because Valorie doesn't have any family photos on display in her place. There are no photos of Sam and no photos of Garry; not even wedding photos.

I can't speak to the Valorie who Sam knew. I do know that in her younger years Valorie was an active member of the LDS church, but that she had stopped being religious by the time that I knew her. The Valorie who I knew was by no means a bigot. I knew her as a kind, loving, and accepting person. She knew that I'm bi and never judged me for it. She has a Pride flag hanging on her balcony and she used to attend Pride parades as one of those ally moms/grandmas who would hug and be supportive to the LGBTQ+ youth who had no one. I knew her has someone who was trying to make amends to the universe. When I first heard the story about Sam I was shocked because that just didn't line up with the Valorie that I knew.

Valorie did have her own Facebook account and knew how to use it, but Sam was not easy to find. It took me a few months to track her down. We used Facebook Messenger because that was our only means of contacting Sam. The ""message"" was a 4-5 page letter where Valorie told Sam everything and completely shared her sole. Valorie only reached out once because, ""Sam was so much like her father and I don't want to push her or hurt her further by pestering. I've told her everything I can until she responds.""

The only direct communication that I've had with Sam was the Facebook messages I sent her about Valorie's death.

I think that covered everyone's questions. Thank you all for providing me with new perspectives, it's been helpful. There's been interested in all of this, so if people want any further updates after probate I'll try and provide them.

UPDATE: 

I met with a lawyer last week and learned some new things. Firstly, that lawyer is going to reaching out to Sam to ask her to stop contacting me directly and to only communicate via him or the probate process. He's also going to ask her what she wants, both from Valorie and what her goal was for contacting me directly. 

This lawyer also explained the formal probate process for my area for me. Legal next of kin only have during the formal probate process to file a contest against a will. Once the process is finished there is no legal way to contest the will. One of the steps of this process is also to legally/officially notify all next of kin and debtors of the death and that the estate is in the formal process. So, Sam was notified by the probate attorneys right around the time that she sent me that first message on Facebook. What's strange is that the probate documentation shows that Sam said she doesn't want anything from Valorie. 

My lawyer also told me that the way Valorie's will was written it would have been challenging for Sam to contest it during the formal probate process. He also said that it was extremely rare for judges to rule against the deceased's wishes; especially when it was easy to prove that those wishes were made when the person was of full sound mind and body. He also added that Sam telling probate that she didn't want anything from Valorie and her harassment style to contacting me would all add additional layers of challenge if she does change her mind and files a contest in court. 

So now I'm waiting to hear back from Sam. I'm now very curious as to why she would tell the probate attorneys that she didn't want anything, but would then turn around and contact me the way she did.

1ld6790,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my DIL that I will never be her mother and to leave me alone,"This is mostly about my daughter-in-law (Kat). Her mother ran out on her when she was a child, and she went into foster care. According to my son, she’s currently seeing a therapist.

My issue with Kat is that she has repeatedly stomped on my boundaries. She’s a very touchy person, she  refuses to call me by my name and only refers to me as “Mom.” I correct her every time since I’m not comfortable being called “Mom” by her, and I want her to use my name.

There have been multiple times where she’s asked inappropriate questions, mostly about why I’m not close to my own mother. (For context, my mother was horrible) Kat keeps pushing for details and insists I should get closer to her because “family sticks together.” She basically tells me to forgive my mom, and she doesn’t understand not being close with one’s parents. I’ve told her to drop the topic multiple times, and she refuses. Because of all this, I’m not a huge fan of hers.

I’ve spoken to my son about it, and he asked me to be patient. I’ve also talked to Kat multiple times and asked her to respect my boundaries. She always says she will, but then goes right back to ignoring them.

This is where I might be the jerk: My daughter Sam (20) and I are taking a weekend trip. Sam has medical issue and needs to see a specialist a few states over. She hasn’t disclosed the issue to the rest of the family yet (she plans to when she has a firm plan).

Somehow, word about the trip got back to Kat, and she called me asking why she wasn’t invited. I told her it’s an important trip and not a fun one. She accused me of lying, claiming it was a “mother-daughter” trip that she was excluded from. I told her again this is not a girls’ trip. She wouldn’t let it go and started demanding that she come, saying that she’s my daughter and needs to be there. I said no again. She kept insisting, saying I am her “mom”and she has to come on this trip since is my kid. That’s when I snapped. I told her I will never be her mother. Just because she married my son does not make me her parent. I told her to leave me the fuck alone and that even if this was a mother-daughter trip, she still wouldn’t be invited, because she isn’t my kid. I then hung up. 

My son says I need to apologize and invite her. That I am a huge dick to her. That I was way out of line and need to make it up to Kat. The situation has spread to the rest of the family, and everyone seems to have their own opinion. Sam is getting flack too, which isn’t helping especially since she doesn’t want to disclose the reason for the trip yet.

Am I being an asshole and need to apologize even tho those are my true feelings on her trying to make me her parent.",9758,0.94,9758,0,10423.0,665.0,1258,1750111521.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ld6790/aita_for_telling_my_dil_that_i_will_never_be_her/,False,True
1mvtfit,AmItheAsshole,"AITAH for kicking out my friend's neurodivergent friend, for what I felt was ignoring boundaries and touching my most personal stuff?","I'm just super annoyed that I'm made to be the bad guy but in case I'm missing something, here it is. 

My friends have a buddy (uses pronouns they/them), they bring along who is on the spectrum and high-functioning. They can drive, live independently, clearly make friends, and hold down a job - so personally, I think they can understand and respect boundaries. 

They have this annoying and disgusting habit of burping really hard, effortfully, so it is loud. And I have a sensitive nose and it smells. I don't care they do that but when it's in my literal personal space, less than three feet, that's an issue. 

I told them several times not to do that when they are literally facing me and talking to me, facing me, or eating right next to me, with an entire plate of food being passed around. 

The end of my patience was then met when I had a gathering and they invited them. They (their friend), came in and I was warm to them, then when I go to the bathroom, I come back looking for them to tell them we are eating dinner. Lo and behold they are playing with my hearing aids I put in a device to dry them out since it was raining.  (My friends just speak louder around me when they are off)

I literally need those for work and my safety, and other people playing with, let alone wearing them, is unsanitary. 

I flipped out and told them to put those down and he burped in my face, laughing, saying they was sorry and tried to hug me. They drop one of my hearing aids on the floor and almost spill their drink on it, the puddle barely touching it as I grabbed it. 

These are $3000 each...

I told them to let go and my friends were trying to get me to understand that they has trouble with these social cues. My response was:

  
""I'm allowed to decide what I put up with in my personal space and who handles my medical devces. Anybody who can hold down a job, make friends, and live alone should be able to respect boundaries. I don't care if they're on the spectrum, that doesn't mean anything on this.""

1nhb7vg,AmItheAsshole,AITA for planning international travel without my children?,"So here's the reality.

I have two kids. They are now 14 and 16. I've had 50/50 since I got divorced, up until a few months ago.

4 years ago, my ex wife got remarried and her husband advised her to start a custody dispute.

I spent $165,000 (basically my life savings) fighting for 4 years. For the record, my ex-wife's father is wealthy and paid all her legal fees. (This comes in to play later) The older child told the court appointed therapist ""I want to live with mom and only see Dad every other weekend"". The younger one just said they wanted to do 50/50.

The younger one then changed their mind and said: ""Oh maybe 70/30 with Mom. I just want court stuff to be over.""

I went to trial. My attorney fought like hell, but the judge said: ""Given the children's age, their preference will take precedence and we won't split them up, as it break their sibling bond.""

Well, my wife and I have been planning some travel with some of her friends, her sister and their husbands. It includes 9 days in Spain and France. They picked the dates. We got tickets. The kids found out about it and have been asking me: ""We want to go. Why can't we go?""

I told my children: ""This is something we planned. We saved for.""

They asked if it was an adults only trip. I told them it was not, and their 15 year old cousin was coming.

They said it was not fair we couldn't take them as they know we could afford it, and that it would be their only chance to travel internationally.

I told them: ""You’re young adults now. You chose to spend the majority of your time with your mother, and you got what you wanted. But choices have consequences. One of them is that you don’t get to join me on things like this.""

They're both very upset. My younger one said: ""You're just mad we have more fun at Mom's house.""

I'm afraid I'm being an asshole here. I'm happy to be wrong. But my gut is telling me what I'm doing is fair.

1kwoqim,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not claiming my friends mistake on my insurance,"Hi! I (26F) and my friend from college (26F) both moved into the same apartment building. She lives on the floor above mine. One weekend she put me along with a bunch of our mutual friends in a group chat because she wanted to have a barbecue on our roof. She has hosted many before, but this would be the first one I ever attended. Because I don’t eat red meat I did not eat anything that was cooked on the grill and only brought chips a bottle and paper plates. When the day was over, the group of us went downstairs to watch a reality show. My friend who lives in my building and the girl who owned the grill discussed that they would leave the grill to cool off. Once the reality show it was over, I went back to my apartment and went to sleep.

The next day everyone in my building receives an email saying that there was a fire on the roof last night because someone dumped coals in the trashcan on the roof and they re-lit due to the wind. I took a screenshot of the email and sent it to my friend who then put it in the group chat of everyone. her and our other friend, who owned the grill, told us that they decided to take the grill home the same day because they didn’t wanna have to come back and get it the next day. So the girl in my building gave the grill owner her keys to go get the grill on the roof and the grill owner decided that it would be the best thing to just toss the coals into the trashcan on the roof. Our building requires multiple key taps to get on and off the roof and they also have cameras so they immediately told  my friend in my building she was responsible since it was her guest using her keys.

A week later, my friend came to me and asked me to put it on my insurance since she nor the grill owner, had renters insurance. I spoke with a few lawyers and my old insurance agent, and they all said that this would be fraud. So I told my friend I did not feel comfortable doing so. Another week goes by and she asked me again because she believed that she would have to go bankrupt over the situation (she did not). I again said no because I did not feel comfortable and reiterated that I was told that this would be fraud.

From then, she started to run a smear campaign, saying that I was the bad friend and all of our friend group stop talking to me because they said that I should’ve at least tried to put it on my insurance. They now all want me to apologize to all of them and work for their friendship again since they believe that I was in the wrong but I feel like I didn’t do any wrong.

1hi5pmy,AmItheAsshole,AITA For Not Letting A Woman Cut The Line At The Grocery Store? ,"Hi Reddit. I need your opinion on grocery store etiquette and not letting someone cut the line. Tonight after work I stopped by my local grocery store to grab a handful of items to make dinner. 5 items in total. I maneuvered my cart behind an older woman who was slowly navigating putting her groceries on the belt to be checked out. She was the only person I noticed in front of me.

A few minutes later another woman tries to edge her way in line in front of my cart. I gave her a quizzical look and she said ""Oh, I was here before, but I went to go and see if the other line over there was moving faster.""

I said, ""Okay, but you weren't here when I arrived soooo (shrug).""

The woman proceeded to inform me, she was here first and that she should be let back in because she only stepped away to see if the other line was faster. I replied that I did not see her here before I joined the line, so, she could get behind me or go back to the other line.

At this point she showed me that she only had a few things and was shocked that I wasn't going to let her back in (she had 4 packs of jello). I pointed out that I too only had a few things and I wasn't going to move because I did not see her in the line in front of me when I joined.

Now this is where I may be the Asshole. At this point we're both getting frustrated in this grocery store pissing match for pole position. She says ""So you're not going to let me back in? Where's your Christmas spirit?"". I'd had enough of her entitlement at this point and I shot back ""Don't pull that shit.""

Honestly, if I had been behind her in line, I would have happily held her place if she has asked. But she wasn't there when I arrived and she just assumed she could cut back in line after a few minutes. Using Christmas Spirit as a means to get what she wanted was the last straw for me.

In the end she, glared at me and said ""I hope you have a Merry Christmas"" her voice dripping with sarcasm. And she left to go back over to another cashier.

The irony is, we both left the store with our items at the same time.

So Reddit, am I the Asshole for not letting this woman cut in front of me and calling her out when she tried to use ""Christmas Spirit"" to get her way",9663,0.98,9663,0,9864.0,201.0,1368,1734649406.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hi5pmy/aita_for_not_letting_a_woman_cut_the_line_at_the/,False,True
1omocby,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my mom why she had kids?,"I (17F) am still in high school and live in an area where it’s really hard to get a job. I don’t have a car because there’s no money for driving school.

Recently, my mom (37) told me she’s not going to buy food anymore because “we’re all grown” and everyone has to buy their own food. This started after she asked my brother (19), who works and also gets to use her car to get to work, to give her $100 to buy food since we rely on SNAP and the government shut it down. He refused, so she decided she’s not buying food for anyone and that everyone has to fend for themselves.

I completely lost it when she told me this and said, “Why did you even have kids? Why have kids if you’re poor and just end up regretting them?” She always talks about how we ruined her life, so I just snapped. I asked why, at 17, broke and having to take care of her own family, she decided to have kids anyway. Kids that she trauma dumps on every chance she gets. She always lets my brother have his way and then gets mad at the rest of us.


In the heat of the argument, I also told her that if she really didn’t want us, she should’ve just aborted us or never had us in the first place. I said that if she really wanted to punish someone, it should be my brother, since he’s the one who refused to help in the first place. She went on to say, “ I should have” “You guys are grown. I already raised you. I already raised you.”


I know what I said was rude and disrespectful, but it’s just so hard not to be when I’m this angry and hurt.

1o9mabt,AmItheAsshole,AITA For Asking Why My Co-Worker Wears Makeup Everyday?,"Howdy howdy, never posted here, throwaway account, yadda yadda yadda.

So I (29M) was at work during a pretty long meeting with a few other co-workers. One of my co-workers is new (late 30s F) and the conversation steered around our professional experiences and history. Pretty standard I guess.

Midway during reviewing some boring stuff this co-worker asked me with a smirk, « Can I ask you a question ? ». Since we were talking about our professional lives I was like « yeah sure what’s up? », and she followed up with why do you always wear hats?

Now, I’ll be honest I’m bald, however I like my baldness. I started balding at 21 and I was like, fuck that, and just shaved it off instead of trying to style my hair in anyway to hide it. Also since my hair is super curly and compact it just wasn’t gonna be an option. In college people loved it, said I had a good head shape and said I looked like Terry Crews, Shaquille O’Neal or The Rock (not sure about that last one lol) so I was pretty confident with it.

But when I turned 25 I started being mistaken for 30 cause of the bald cut so I started wearing hats pretty much everywhere. Grew a collection for all situations, work, gym, social life. Anywhere besides weddings and funerals tbh. And with hats on at 29 I’ve been mistaken to be as young as 22 (not the goal but yeah). The plan was to wear them until 30 and then cut back when my head matched my age lol

Anyways, this co-worker asks « why do you wear hats everyday? » to be fair it’s a corporate setting but it’s also tech, we’re in marketing and it’s 2025 so smart-casual is the rule of thumb and my bosses don’t care and dress in hoodies and hats to work some days.

I responded « I like hats » and she said « but everyday? », so I said « yeah I’m bald, I like my headshape but I don’t wanna look like I’m 35 so I’ll wear hats for now, plus I look good in them! ».

This truck a nerve with me so I responded « Well since joining I’ve seen you wear makeup everyday, even casual Fridays or on your work from home team calls, so why do YOU wear makeup everyday? » there was a muffled giggle but it’s clear the atmosphere was tense.

She got heated and said « that’s a sexist question » and I said « How? Other women in the office don’t wear makeup everyday and my boyfriend sometimes wears makeup when we go out to a high class event. He just doesn’t do it everyday. So why do you wear makeup everyday? »

She got heated and silent and one of the other co-workers went back to focusing on the deck. I feel like her and I not on the best of terms now as she will not talk to me now.

1lli21y,AmItheAsshole,AITA For Choosing to Go to My Grandfathers Funeral over my unborn daughter’s 20 week ultrasound?,"My wife (F 25) and I (M 26) are expecting a baby girl due in November. We are both so excited for it! I’ve been talking to her through my wife’s belly, being excited feeling kicks, all of the fun stuff. 3 weeks ago we scheduled the 20 week ultrasound (it’ll be closer to 22 weeks).

The last week and a half my grandfather’s health had been slowly diminishing. I had a talk with my father and family and were told that sometime within a week of his passing we would have the funeral. This made my wife and I have to talk about the plan. I was asked to be a pallbearer at the funeral. She said she’d want to stay home with the dogs so we didn’t have to board them and that I could go by myself to the 4-4.5 hour trip up north to my fathers home town.

Unfortunately, my grandfather passed away late last night/early this morning. I called my father to make sure he was okay which he was holding on as much as one would when your father passes away. But I was told the funeral would be held at 10 am on Wednesday… this just so happens to be the exact same day that my wife has the ultrasound.

My wife is now upset that I plan to go to my grandfathers funeral instead of go to the ultrasound appointment. I said “well we could FaceTime? But it’s my grandfather” I know FaceTime isn’t the same. But she said “yeah, but this is your daughter”. Now she is mad and upset at me. I’m emotionally torn from this because I’m so excited for my baby girl but also really sad about my grandfather..

I just.. I want to know if I’m the asshole here. My wife’s feeling are always going to be valid, but I feel like mine aren’t being considered in this situation.

1jv09au,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not bringing anything to my friend’s potluck after she told me not to?,"One of my close friends hosted a dinner at her place last weekend. She called it a “potluck” and sent a group text saying we should each bring a little something, drinks, snacks, whatever. It wasn’t anything fancy, just casual. I asked her what I should bring and mentioned I’d be coming straight from work and might be a little rushed. She replied that I didn’t need to worry about it, she had plenty of food and just wanted me to come.

So I didn’t bring anything. I showed up, said hi to everyone, and honestly, the night was going fine. People brought stuff, a salad, some cupcakes, a couple bottles of wine. I was planning to just help clean up or do dishes since I didn’t bring anything, and I figured she meant what she said.

But later on, while people were complimenting the food, she made this offhand comment like, “Well, not everyone contributed… but we’re still glad she showed up.” Everyone laughed, and it didn’t seem super serious, but I felt my face get hot. I didn’t know how to respond.

I stayed polite and tried not to act weird about it, but I felt uncomfortable the rest of the night. On the way home, I kept thinking about it. I get that maybe she was a little annoyed, but she literally told me not to bring anything. And now I feel like she put me on blast in front of people for something I didn’t even do wrong.

I haven’t said anything to her yet because it feels small and I don’t want to be dramatic, but I also can’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t fair.

1jgeljt,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not following my husband's family tradition?,"My (28f) husband (29m) comes from a very traditional family. While we disagree with his family on many things, it has never really been an issue until now.

I am currently 8 months pregnant and my husband and I couldn't be happier as we've been trying for a while. Since I first found out I was pregnant, we've been discussing names for our child. In my husband's family, the tradition wants the child to be named after his grandfather. Basically, first-born men in his family only have one of two names: James or Henry. My husband's grandfather was James, so his name is James too. My husband's father is called Henry, so our child should be too. And so on and so forth.

But my husband and I didn't really feel like calling our child Henry, and although it's a beautiful way to honor family members, we really wanted our child to have a name that would be personal, that would truly be his. So we chose another name, and decided to wait until after the birth to reveal it to everyone.

This week, my mother in law came to visit us and help us set up for the baby. She brought us some presents, amongst which was a bunch of clothes on which she hand embroidered the name Henry. I said that it was nice and thanked her for it, but told her that we wouldn't be naming our child Henry, as we had already told her in the past. She started insisting and saying that it was a tradition so it had to be that way. I explained to her that we'd rather give our child a name that we chose, and that Henry could be his middle name.

She immediately went to my husband and started saying things like ""you're not going to let her do that to our family"" and making it very dramatic, saying that I was breaking a tradition that went back hundreds of years (honestly not sure about that). My husband tried to explain that we both agreed on the name, and all the reasons why we made that choice, but she wouldn't listen. She suggested that we names him Henry on paper, as his legal name, and then called him something else, but I thought that would be confusing for him and told her that he would be named what we chose.

She kept begging my husband and saying that I was ruining the family tradition, and at one point I lost it (which is partially to blame on hormones I think) and told her that it was our child, so we did what we wanted, and we didn't have to follow a stupid tradition. She stormed out and my husband has since received texts from his father and sister accusing me of making his mother feel really bad and some other stuff that I don't really remember.

I get the importance of tradition and it can be really beautiful, but also I feel like that shouldn't be an obligation and it's okay to change things. We won't change our baby's name because we're really set on that, but maybe we were wrong for not following the tradition? I'm not entirely sure, and am mentally exhausted by all this drama...

  
Edit: I've seen many comments mentioning they saw similar stories in the past. I'd like to clarify: those weren't mine, all of those events happened two days ago. But it's crazy to see how many families have similar traditions, I really thought this was a super rare thing!

I saw it when I got a notification that I was tagged. I had over 50 messages from distant friends and coworkers before I could even process it. We hadn't even told our friends yet.

I was totally mad, called her screaming. She tried to say it was ""an accident"" and that she ""forgot"" and she was just teasing.

1n607gu,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to reimburse my friend for a chair that broke under me?,"I (F25) was at a friend’s house for a game night this past weekend with a group of about 6. Everyone brought food and drinks and we were having a good time, when about halfway through the night I got up to use the bathroom. When I came back, I saw that one of the girls had moved from a chair to the side to my space on the couch. This didn’t bug me as people shuffle around in groups, so whatever. The chair was an antique wooden chair that sat a bit lower to the ground with an added back/butt cushion. When I sat down it immediately broke, sending me to the ground with the seat under me and the arm frames falling to the side.

Everyone got quiet for a second before jumping up to help me. I wasn’t hurt, just very embarrassed. For context I’m a bigger girl, about 260 pounds at 5 foot 7 inches. My friend (F27) was very gracious and nice about it when it happened, accepting my apologies and telling me not to worry. Her boyfriend (M29) said that the chair was his grandmother’s and it has fallen apart before and he was able to repair it. I was ushered back to the couch and game night continued.

Fast forward to the next morning, I received a text from my friend who let me know that the chair couldn’t be put back together, and that from her research it would cost about $250 to get a new one, but she’d let me know exactly how much when she found one. I was a bit taken aback, and responded confused, asking why I would be expected to pay for a faulty chair. She said that while yes, on occasion the frames would become unattached and cause it to fall apart, but that that’s not what happened this time. She sent me pictures of the broken chair, particularly a bent support and 2 other broken supports. She said that the chair broke under my weight and couldn’t be fixed, and since the chair was an antique from her boyfriend’s late grandmother, she wanted a new one for him.

I responded that the chair was very old and had a history of collapsing. If they were concerned about preserving it, they should’ve not had it out for people to use, and $250+ for a chair I sat in for 1 second seems a bit ridiculous. At this point she seemingly got frustrated, and said that she loves me but that I’m her “biggest friend” and that it wouldn’t have happened to anyone else. She said: “It broke from your weight plopping down all at once, not because the frame was loose. I think it’s only fair you reimburse us for the chair since you’re responsible for breaking it.”

I’m still figuring out how to respond. I don’t want to pay her for something I don’t see as being completely my fault. I also think she’s using the scenario to shame me about my weight a bit, which I find frustrating. My friends’ opinions are mixed. A few are saying that I should just pay her and move on, even if it’s not exactly my fault. One thinks it is my fault and I should pay up, and a few more think she’s in the wrong for asking and I should continue to politely decline.

From the moment he sat down, Mark kept making little comments like, “Did you forget to season this?” or “This is why I stick to takeout.” At first, I laughed it off, but he wouldn’t stop. Eventually, he said something like, “Man, even a frozen pizza would’ve been better than this.”

That was the last straw for me. I told him, “If you hate it so much, maybe you should just leave.” He laughed, thinking I was joking, but I wasn’t. I made it clear he wasn’t welcome to stay if he was going to keep insulting me.

He ended up leaving, but since he didn’t drive, he had to walk home (about 20 minutes). Now, a few friends are saying I overreacted and that kicking him out was too harsh, while others think he deserved it. Mark texted me later, calling me “petty” and saying I made him feel humiliated.

1hjfuhg,AmItheAsshole,AITA refusing to ban alcohol from Christmas? ,"We have a large mix family. My wife is Mexican so her family starts dropping in on Christmas Eve and we host them and my family Christmas day for dinner. It could be over 50 people in and out of our house in those two days. There’s lots of mixing of cultures because who doesn’t want tequila and tamales.  I’m often gifted drinks and my wife likes wine. 

My older brother Mike started dating this new woman who has children.  I’ll call her Jenny. Jenny wants to bring her 3 children that I have only met briefly over the summer. But she said her children are not allowed around people who drink. So now Mike wants me to ban all alcohol at Christmas from my house. My mother backs him up saying it’s unnecessary to have all those people around children even though I have 2 of my own and my children love the loud bustling house at Christmas and playing with their cousins.  These no other children on my side of the family so Jenny’s children “like my family” and need to adjust my holiday to make Jenny and them feel welcome. 

Another issue I was told to talk about my kids is Santa. Santa wasn’t really a thing in my wife’s culture so we did away with it before my wife felt like the whole naughty and nice thing with Santa doesn’t go with her Mexican Catholic roots so Santa is more of symbol of Christmas for my children and the cousins. 

I understand that Jenny is really into Santa and Elf on the Shelf. My children are 5 &amp; 8 and Jenny’s are 4-10 and I don’t know how my children or their cousins would react to all of that if it was brought up. I said maybe next year maybe my mom could host our family’s Christmas or my brother and Jenny could (if they are still together) but I don’t feel like setting rules in my house about tequila and making kids pretend Santa and elf on the self is real or talk to their cousins about it. It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen so I think Jenny and her kids should stay at home.

1kc9kqm,AmItheAsshole,AITA for ruining my SIL's birthday by crying?,"I (43M) am an Advanced Paramedic in Critical Care. This means I’m trained to treat very serious injury and illness, and also work in my service’s Emergency Operations Centre to monitor emergency calls and dispatch other AP-CCs. Because it’s a high-stress job and my shifts can easily overrun, I usually only commit to social events on my days off.

Recently, my SIL (40F) booked a meal at a nice restaurant to celebrate her birthday. I initially told my partner (44M) I couldn’t go as I had a 6am-4pm shift that day. However, he really wanted me to go, so I got my shift changed from Ambulance Crew to EOC, thinking it would decrease the chance of being too late or too drained to go.

The shift was awful - my country’s healthcare system is extremely overburdened and I had to make a lot of difficult decisions prioritising calls. Near the end of my shift, I had to input on a complex, distressing call which took almost 2 hours. I left work 90 mins late and got to the restaurant about 20 mins late, in uniform and very tired.

When I arrived, SIL sarcastically said it was nice of me to finally show up and to make such an effort with my clothes. I apologised, saying I had a call that overran. My partner asked about the call, and I said I didn’t want to discuss it as it was upsetting and probably inappropriate for SIL’s daughter (8F) to hear. BIL (38M) said it was just a call and I wasn’t actually there, so if I’m going to use it as an excuse to disrespect his wife I should tell them what happened. I said it wasn’t an excuse, I couldn’t just hang up emergency calls when I felt like it, and SIL said I shouldn’t have taken the call when I knew I had to leave. I said I was the only AP on duty so what was I supposed to do, make a junior dispatcher do my job for me? SIL said not everything was about me or how important and special my job is, especially not her birthday.

I was honestly so overwhelmed I started crying, although I know it was probably an overreaction. I was also really embarrassed as I don’t cry in front of others, so I went to the toilet to calm down. My partner came to check on me and I said I just wanted to go home. He said it was fine, he would explain to SIL and BIL, so I left.

When he got home later, he said SIL and BIL were furious that I’d ruined the meal by making it about me, as they felt I should have made sure I was on time and out of uniform, or at least been more understanding about why SIL was upset. I said SIL made it about me by being rude over a 20 min delay when I was clearly exhausted, and he said I couldn’t expect others to manage my stress for me when I chose a high-stress job. I said I *was* managing my stress when I said I couldn’t go, and he said he also has a stressful job and still doesn’t use it as an excuse to flake on his family.

He wants me to apologise to SIL, and I’m still hurt over the situation. However, I feel really bad for ruining the meal, and I’m worried I did overreact and make everybody cater to my emotions. AITA?

1j59byb,AmItheAsshole,AITA for feeding my family a fish dinner while I eat steak and potatoes,"So apparently we don’t get many characters so I’ll try my best to make this short and simple and straight to the point. 

I am three months pregnant and almost everyday I’ve been craving steak and sour cream baked potatoes. I never really cared for steak I’m more of a chicken fingers and fries girlie but I’m guessing the baby must’ve loved steak in its past life because that literally all I crave when I don’t even care for it. 
Today I made my family baked pizza spaghetti with fried catfish a lunch eat salad (salad with chopped deli meat) and dinner rolls. I of course am making the same dish I’ve been eating for almost everyday these last few months. I pretty much make 2 separate meals each night for my cravings. 

Last night after I served the kids and was getting ready to make my finances plate he expressed he wanted steak and potatoes like me. Mind you he was aware of the menu because I have my meals planned night before . I told him I only had that one steak for me. He said “ well we can share” I politely told him that I will need to eat all of my food since I am feeding for two and this is all I have for the night knowing I’ll most likely still be hungry whilst you guys have a meal you can come back for seconds. I am now, in his words a “selfish woman using pregnancy as an excuse to be selfish”. I asked what’s different about today than all the other days when I’ve been literally eating the same shit almost everyday with no complaints? He said nothing but shook his head and said “ it’s the principle bae” and just walked off. We’ve barely spoken since. Just a dry good morning and goodbyes. AITA?

1metmmm,AmItheAsshole,WIBTA if I kick my boyfriend's sister out our house?,"Obligatory ""this is a throwaway account"", I don't really use Reddit that much but don't want people I know finding this. 

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for three years and he moved in with me last year. Everything was going great until last Christmas when his parents announced they were selling the family home, and downsizing but they wanted to go on one of those six month long cruises around the world. Fine, whatever they can do what they want except they have a younger daughter ""Emma"" who is 18. Completely unbeknownst to me, my boyfriend had agreed to let Emma live with us until she moved away to uni. This led to a lot of fights between my boyfriend and I because I didn't want Emma living with us. Despite all this, she moved in after the house sold in February. 

It has been hell. For starters, our house might have three bedrooms but only one was used as a bedroom. One is my home and the other was a home gym for me and my boyfriend. Emma turned the gym into her room and now a lot of our equipment is in storage. I hate having Emma here as she's a total brat and doesn't contribute anything to the house. Here is just a small list of shit I have to deal with:

- the second Emma turned 18 she was out with friends, coming back drunk at 3am and waking up my dogs as she clattered into the house, normally with an equally drunk friend. 

- for the first month of her living with us she would steal my stuff constantly. Skincare, haircare, perfume, clothes. Anything. I now have a lockable box for toiletries so she can't get to them. 

- has lost six different sets of house keys since moving in and I've had to have the lock changed twice due to various issues. 

- refuses to do anything I ask her to do because she's ""busy"" SHE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB. HOW IS SHE BUSY??

- refuses to eat anything I cook and will demand we order takeaway instead. I have asked her repeatedly for meals ideas and even if I make that exact meal, she refuses to eat it as ""it doesn't taste right"". 

The breaking point came last weekend when me, my boyfriend and the dogs went away for the weekend. I was reluctant to leave Emma in the house by herself but my boyfriend said it would be a great way for Emma to gain some independence before going to uni. Big fucking mistake. We came back in Sunday evening to a trashed house and a hungover Emma asleep in her room. I had to get a professional cleaner in on Monday to tackle the worst of the mess after I spent half the night cleaning. 

I'm done. I want her out the house. I thought I could deal with this until she moved away in September but I can't, especially now that she's talking about putting her place on hold for a year so she can go travelling and use our house as a base. No, I want her gone and out asap. True, she has nowhere to go as her parents aren't back from their cruise until the end of August but I don't care. I want her gone. 

I've talked to my boyfriend about this and he won't budge because Emma is family and he can't kick her out. So WIBTA if I kick her out??? 

Edit: Forgot to mention this in the post/maybe it wasn't clear. It's my house. I own it outright with no mortgage and my boyfriend is not on any official documents. The only thing in his name is our Sky TV payments. Everything else is in my name as I lived here before he moved in. He does pay half towards bills but he just sends the money to me each month. 

I'm going to try and talk to Emma and boyfriend's parents. I've sent them a text message asking to call me asap. I'm also reaching out to Emma and my boyfriend's older sister to see if she will take Emma in for a while. I doubt she will as they don't get along and she has a two year old but it's worth a shot. 

Edit Two: I AM SUCH A GODDAMN IDIOT. 

Firstly, thanks to all of the comments I have realised that my boyfriend is not the person I want to be spending the rest of my life with. 

Secondly, I managed to have a video call with my boyfriends parents and wow, just wow. First of all, THEY HAVE BEEN SENDING EMMA £700 A MONTH TO COVER HER LIVING WITH US AND I HAVEN'T SEEN A PENNY OF IT. Their mum mentioned that I could take the cleaner fee out of Emma's money and I asked what money she meant because Emma doesn't have a job. She laughed and said ""The £700 we send Emma each month to cover all her expenses while she lives with you."" They've been sending Emma money and she was supposed to be giving this money to us to cover everything. Either Emma has been keeping it or she's given it to my boyfriend and he hasn't said a word. 

Surprisingly her parents were furious that I haven't seen any of this money and they are sending me a bank transfer of £4200 to cover the money Emma should have been giving us since February. They are sending it to my personal account then I can do with what I see fit. 

I was brutally honest on the call and said that I can't have Emma staying with us any longer. Yes, she might leave in September but what if she doesn't get the results she needs for uni and has to defer or if she takes a gap year. I'm not putting up with this for another year. Their mum is going to talk to her sister and see if Emma can stay there until they get back at the end of August. 

For those wondering, yes they have a house all lined up for when they return. They will not be living with us when they get back. 

I'm going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend this evening and I'm now rethinking our whole relationship. If he tries to fight over Emma staying then it's over. A lot of the comments in this post have made me realise that I've been a doormat to this man since Emma moved in (also that I should have been charging him rent) and I'm not standing for it any more.

It has both public sessions and private sessions, I obviously booked one of the private sessions and didn't interfere with the usual times it's available 'to the public'.

When I opened the buffet, a woman I didn't know approached me, asking if her children could have some. I explained I had booked the venue for a private party, she said 'that doesn't matter, my children want some food'. I replied no because the food was for the party.

She walked away telling her children to just wait until I had left the food area. Realising she wasn't taking my answer, I asked staff to speak to her. 

They did, explaining it was a private event and they needed to leave. She shouted that her and her children were not leaving and that I should be told to allow the children to have the food.

I went back over, said again it was a private event, and she shouted 'what is a sandwich?!' repeatedly at me, until I shouted back that she needed to leave.

She did eventually leave, 'flicking the Vs' at me as she walked out the door.

The soft play wasn't at capacity, and in truth, there probably was enough for them to have some of the buffet, but the way she approached me with the assumption I'd say yes, and then blatantly planning to disregard my answer made me stand my ground.

So AITA for kicking out the gatecrashers?

EDIT:
OK so first of all, I did not expect this to literally blow up the way it has... I thought a couple of people would say yes or no, and that would be it 😅

Apolgies for the long edit, but there's been a few 'themes' within comments, so I'll try to address them;

- A soft play is a massive indoor climbing frame covered in padding and safety nets, with slides and ball pits etc. I think some may call it a 'jungle gym' but I'm not sure that is a direct comparison

- 'flicking the Vs' is a peace sign but showing the back of your hand. About the same level of rude as giving the middle finger in the UK

- The venue shares a desk with an adjoining spots hall, which wasn't running open sessions as it was hosting a game. Past the desk is the exit, (it's one door in, one door out thing) door 1 to the soft play, door 2 to the sports hall. I found out later she had come to use the sports hall and was told about the game. Staff thought she went out the exit

- I've spoken to the venue about her being able to get in, and they apologised and are changing how they operate the private sessions. Despite this happening, I think the place has appropriate security measures. I think she took advantage of staff being busy letting in spectators to the sports hall and tried her luck. As we have an invite for a party here in a few weeks, I'll know if they do and can raise it again if needed, but hopefully won't need to

- I went back over when the staff member was talking to her because I felt bad that I put a young girl in the firing line. This woman was just shouting that she wasn't leaving, and I also hadn't spotted them come in, but I should have let her/her manager sort it

- This is in the UK. This wasn't a food stamps have been taken and 'chance a free meal or starve tonight' situation. When she eventually left she brought snacks out of the over priced vending machine. That obviously doesn't tell any of us her full story, but the venue has like 10 places with a few minutes walk where much more affordable snacks and food choices are

- Some people asked about the kids ages. Top age of an invited child was 5. Her two kids were 8/9 and 9/10

- I replied to a couple of comments that I would have told her the kids could have some after all the guests had eaten, if it had been a question and not a demand. I am responsible for my actions, but they were influenced by hers, and I am glad I stood my ground and wasn't bullied at my own event, although not proud that I did shout at the end

Again, I didn't expect this would get so much attention, but to those who were polite and asked questions, thank you.

To anyone who asked 'why are you even asking?' or similar, I was asking to gauge if I was unreasonable for standing my ground because of her actions/reactions. Maybe this was the wrong sub, I'm not very reddit savvy, apologies if I put it in the wrong place...

And for anyone who thinks I made it up... I don't know what to tell you... it happened, and I'm glad you've not encountered a similar experience before and/or can't believe it",9318,0.92,9318,0,10205.0,887.0,638,1762040322.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1om2k64/aita_for_kicking_out_a_family_that_gatecrashed_a/,False,True
1jo7t2l,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my wife she can’t cook?,"I (29m) have been with my wife (28f) for 8 years, and meals are just about the only place of contention in our marriage, but I’m scared she’s going to kill someone one day.

Background - we split the cooking in our house 50/50, but when she cooks I feel like I have to watch her like a hawk. She undercooks just about everything, especially meat, and no matter how many times I try to politely correct her, she claims I’m being “picky”. 

For example, every time she makes rice, I just can’t convince her it’s 1 part rice to 2 parts water. She always says “are you sure? That seems like a lot of water.” Or “Maybe that’s how you like it, but I don’t want it so mushy”. The package and google won’t convince her either, and I just swallow my pride and eat the crunchy rice every time. It’s like that with everything. Pasta, veggies, bread, meat…

The thing is, I wouldn’t care so much if it was just me, but she always wants to cook for our friends. She really prides herself on her cooking and wants to make everything herself. I just trail behind her, trying to make sure it’s all edible, but there’s usually a few dishes that end up drastically over salted or undercooked. Our friends will politely eat, but I noticed they’ve been coming to fewer and fewer invitations for dinner.

Things all came to a head the other night when she went to put some chicken in the oven as I was hopping in the shower. When I came out, she had pulled the chicken out and said dinner was ready. I was skeptical and told her that it had only been like 10 minutes. She said she pan-seared it first so it was fine, but when I came to look, the sides were literally pink.

I snapped a little and told her she’s going to kill someone one day from serving them raw meat. Can’t you see that it’s pink? That’s food safety number 1. She said she thought it was done, and it’s not her fault, her mother never showed her how to cook chicken growing up. I then told her “Well you’re almost thirty, that’s no excuse for not knowing how to cook at all.”

Needless to say she was pretty upset with me, and I probably could’ve been nicer. But I’ve been nice about it for 8 years and nothing has changed. AITA?

One of them is on a visit in our country right now, and he brought his daughter(11) with him. He asked if I could take her to our National Museum since it’s ’good for kids to practice some art appreciation.’ I said ‘Sure!’ She wasn’t very enthusiastic about it though.

When we were waiting for the opening time, she pointed at a nearby cafe and asked if I could buy her a cup of coffee, saying it’s the least I could do before making her spend two hours look at some boring stuff. I hesitated and she said her dad lets her drink latte so I called him just to check. He said yes before asking ‘Did you think my daughter is a liar?’

And I didn’t know what to say. It didn’t occur to me that that was what I was insinuating when I was expressing my doubt. I just wanted to be sure.

1llepvm,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a woman to keep her comments to herself in an elevator?,"This happened earlier today. I was waiting for the elevator in my office building. The doors opened, no one was directly in front of me, so I stepped in. A woman and an elderly couple were just behind me, but I hadn’t seen or heard them until after I got on.

As soon as I stepped in, the woman complained out loud that I didn’t let her on first. I was caught off guard, but I apologized and said there was plenty of room for everyone, so it wasn’t a big deal. I wasn’t trying to cut anyone off; I genuinely didn’t notice anyone behind me.

She got on with the couple but kept going, saying how rude I was, how I had no manners, how people like me are what’s wrong these days, stuff like that. This went on for at least a minute, maybe more, and eventually I snapped a bit. I raised my voice and said Could you just keep your comments to yourself.

She went quiet, but the old couple sort of whispered something to her and gave me a look. Now I’m wondering if I just confirmed whatever idea they had about me, like maybe I actually was the jerk here.

I honestly didn’t mean to offend anyone. I just wanted to ride the elevator in peace.

So, AITA for finally telling her to be quiet?",9294,0.96,9294,0,9698.0,404.0,825,1750979765.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1llepvm/aita_for_telling_a_woman_to_keep_her_comments_to/,False,True
1nax76j,AmItheAsshole,WIBTA if I threatened to turn of my Life360?,"I (19F) am in my first week of college. I've had life360 with my parents since I was about 16 for general safety reasons. However, they're a bit overbearing and controlling about where I go, even after I turned 18. I've found myself being extremely stressed about doing very normal things and being worried about them getting upset.

Before I left for college my mom asked me to leave my life360 on, joking about how she ""wants to know what ditch to get me out of"" if something goes wrong, which I completely understand, but my parents have been obsessively checking my location since I've gotten here. They've mentioned in passing places I went (literally like stores to buy stuff for school) when I didn't tell them I was going. They've been pressuring me to go to church and checking my location frequently to make sure I am (I don't want to but I like to keep the peace). It's a bit uncomfortable.

I'm wondering if I'd be an asshole if I told them that if they don't stop stalking me, I'm going to turn off my life360. I understand their reasoning behind wanting me to have it, but it's uncomfortable knowing that wherever I am they're probably looking constantly. 

I'd appreciate any input yall have.

EDIT: Wow. Posting here has been so validating and I feel less crazy. Thank you for your kind words of support and advice.

1hts7rx,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my sister that my nephew is NOT my baby? ,"My sister (23f) lives at home and has a 6 month old baby. She never moved in with her boyfriend because they live far from each other and neither of them wanted to compromise. Her baby daddy never ever comes around, he’s seen their son probably less than 30 days total of his entire life. And because of this my sister has been treating me (21f) and my mom as his other parent. She expects free childcare CONSTANTLY while she works and whatnot and gets very upset when I act hesitant about it for whatever reason. Because she doesn’t want to send him to daycare (she’d be eligible to get free childcare in our state but doesn’t trust it). 

And I love my nephew to death but these are MY child free, college years; I have been parentified and forced to play mommy for my little siblings for years, and just when they’re getting to the age that they don’t need me so much I don’t think I should be forced to step up and play mommy to another child who isn’t mine. Especially when I’m on winter break for the next couple of weeks and just want to enjoy sleeping in way too late and being lazy before I’m thrown back into full time college (this has been happening for 4 months at this point though). So when she asked if I’d watch him tomorrow I got a bit of an attitude but ultimately said yes. But to that she got snappy with me and was like “Why do you always act like you don’t want to do it?!” To which I got upset and responded “Because he’s not my kid and I shouldn’t be expected to do this all the time.” 

She got VERY angry at me and is now not talking to me at all, and is surely going to weaponize my nephew against me. And to an extent, sure I understand her anger: I know that you should be able to rely on your village and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for not wanting to do this. But I am so tired of taking care of other people’s children all the time for free, even if I love the kids to death. I can’t tell if I’m being selfish or not, AITA here?

He moved in saying he just needed “a few months” until he was able to save enough money to rent his own place. It’s been a year, but he’s never once paid for bills, groceries, nothing. He doesn’t even do basic chores, but my wife (she's his brother) always tries to cover for him and does his chores for him instead. He leaves dishes in the sink, doesn’t take out the trash. Just sits around on his phone when he's at home to play mobile games or goes out on his motorcycle to go on long rides with his buddies. We’ve been biting our tongues because he’s family, but last week was the last straw. He came home late, parked his bike, and didn’t lock the gate. As a result of his neglect, our dog of 12 years got out. We searched everywhere and even made Facebook posts, only to find out a few hours later that he got hit by a car just outside our subdivision. We were devastated and I was very furious. But guess who was the one acting pissed off?? My BIL. Saying it “wasn’t his fault” and that “shit happens"" and that he'd just buy us a new dog. LOL. He hasn't even contributed a single cent to our monthly electric or internet bills.

I lost it. Told him to pack his stuff and get out. My wife thinks I was too harsh, but I honestly don’t care anymore. He doesn’t respect our home, our rules, or our damn dog.

1mnjm1v,AmItheAsshole,AITA if I gave my best friends kids a different lifechanging amount of money?,"I 37f recently received a lifechanging amount of money.  I haven’t told my best friend, 37f, yet that she &amp; her two kids (12f &amp; 2m) will each be gifted a lifechanging amount of money in an irrevocable trust.  Here is where it gets a bit sticky, I want to give 12f 2.5 million and 2m 1.5 million.  The reason I want to do this is because I helped raise 12f when she was little and I still have her with me every school vacation.  She genuinely fees like she is my child, she calls me mom, and there is no difference between her and my own children, it’s the exact same amount of love.  12f abused when she was younger which has resulted in several mental issues.  Her therapist has said it may be difficult for her to live a normal life and she will likely need lifelong therapy.  2m has his dad in his life (12f’s dad OD’d), his dad is a lifer in the military, and 2m is very blessed with new clothing, toys, etc (12f is not). 2m is setup better in life, it is what it is.  I grew up as the black sheep of the family and did not get the same opportunities my siblings did and has had a lifelong ramification.  I look at 12f’s life and I can’t help but see her childhood shaping up to be like mine and I don’t want that.  While I can’t change her situation, I can give her money to use to help her future.  Money is a tool after all. 

My concern is how my friend will take this.  In her eyes they are both her children, and they are treated equal.  I don’t want her to see the discrepancy in the amount and think I don’t love 2m as much or I see him as lesser than his sister, and I don’t.  But I am more invested in 12f and my motherly instinct is to provide and protect her.  In addition to this, this is a gift.  This is on my own free will and why can’t I do this?

So I (28F) got married last year. It was a small but beautiful ceremony with our closest family and friends. My older sister (32F) and I have always had a complicated relationship, we’re close, but she’s also extremely emotional and kind of dramatic. She was supposed to be my maid of honor.

Two days before my wedding, her 14 year old dog passed away unexpectedly. I was obviously sympathetic, but she called me sobbing, saying she couldn’t emotionally handle coming to the wedding because she was too devastated. I tried to talk her down, even offered to have someone bring her home early if it was too much, but she refused and didn’t show up.

It hurt. A lot. She missed one of the biggest days of my life, and I had no maid of honor. We didn’t talk much after that. A few months ago, she got engaged and just last week asked me to be her maid of honor.

I told her I couldn’t. I said I still felt hurt she missed my wedding, and while I love her, I just couldn’t pretend like everything was fine. She got extremely upset, said I was being cold and petty, and that her dog was like her child. Our parents are pressuring me to just be the bigger person.

1kd5li4,AmItheAsshole,AITA for moving someone else's birthday cake out of reach of an entitled toddler?,"I was just at my girlfriend's mom's birthday party. We'd ordered an expensive cake for her and split the cost three ways with her sisters. 

Her brother, who *never* contributes to any of the shared presents, brought his spoiled 2 year old kid.  
While everyone was singing Happy Birthday, the kid started sticking his hands into the cake and licking them, and picking off the decorations. I looked around in horror but her brother and his wife were just smiling at this like it was the absolute cutest thing ever, and everyone else was totally unfazed and said nothing.   
I bit my tongue and didn't say anything either, *but.....* I reached over and moved the cake a few inches out of reach of the kid.   
  
Immediately the kid started thrashing around and screaming bloody murder. Everyone glared at me like I was the most evil POS on earth for doing what I did and rushed to placate the kid, *""awwh you poor little thing""*\-ing and giving him cake.   
I doubled down and calmly, rationally said what the kid was doing was incredibly unhygienic, it wasn't his birthday cake and he's old enough to be taught to wait literally one minute until he gets a slice of cake instead of destroying someone else's birthday cake and covering it with his germs.

1ljmdro,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not bringing gifts to my nephews’ birthdays because they never give my kids anything?,"I (34F) have two kids. Over the past few years, my nephews have had several birthday parties. We’ve always been invited, and I used to bring gifts every time. But I started noticing that when it’s my kids’ birthdays, their parents never bring anything, or even acknowledge it. My kids don’t even get a “happy birthday” from them.

It’s started to feel very one-sided. Their parents (my brother and sister-in-law) are often cold and dismissive toward me and my kids. So this year, I decided I wasn’t going to keep doing something for people who clearly don’t return the effort. I still went to the party — but didn’t bring any gifts.

After the party, I got a bunch of texts saying I was being petty and “you don’t punish kids for adult problems.” Now I’m starting to wonder if I was in the wrong, and maybe I should’ve separated the kids from how I feel about their parents. AITA for not bringing any gifts?

**Edit:** For those asking — yes, we’ve always had birthday parties for my kids, and my brother, sister-in-law, and their children were invited every time. They attended a few over the years but never brought gifts or really acknowledged the occasion.

Also, for clarification: it wasn’t even my brother or SIL who texted me after the party — it was my parents. So clearly, someone complained to them behind the scenes.

1m1bx4k,AmItheAsshole,AITA For telling my Niece her mother tried to give her away as a baby?,"I (28 M) got into a huge argument with my sister (31 F) last week. The argument had been simmering for a long time, as tension between us has been high for years.

When I was 17 my sister had an accidental pregnancy, and when she told her boyfriend he left her. Due to our religious family she kept the baby, but once her daughter was born she panicked. She didn’t want to go through the legal troubles of adoption, so she asked that me and our mother took care of her kid. There was no legal custody, but it was an agreement made within the family.

I essentially raised my niece from birth until she was 3. With help from my mother, as she was working to support the new edition to the family. I dropped out of school and took care of her, fed her, changed her and taught her how to walk while my mom was away at work.

Then, my sister met her now husband, cleaned her life up and suddenly wanted her kid back. No warning, she moves back to home says thanks and starts being a mother. My niece is now eleven and doesn’t remember all I and her grandmother did. It’s been a family agreement to forget this all happened until the argument.

My sister made a petty comment during a fight, where she implied since I lost my job recently I can’t handle responsibility. I snapped and told her she was lucky her daughter was too young to remember how she abandoned her. My niece overheard this, and now wants to know what I meant. I outright said that her mother didn’t think she could raise her, and left her with me and grandma. Now my sister says I traumatised her daughter, and my mom says I should have kept the secret like we agreed. I think this secret couldn’t stay kept forever. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: hello, I’m here to give some more context and answer a bunch of the most common questions. When the argument happened, I had put my niece to bed hours ago. We were at my mothers house, and so no one knew she was going to come in.

Secondly, after my niece was born my sister moved states to get a job. Also, she was 20 and I was 17.

And finally, in the aftermath I said that we can’t go back now since my niece already overheard us all talking, so as a group with her stepfather we should get together to explain it better. But since the event (a week ago) my sister has been saying that we should blow over it and that my niece will forget if we don’t bring it up again. I’m frustrated at this, and at how she’s now slating me alongside my mother. My mother believes I’m in the wrong for arguing with my sister in the first place, whereas I say she has no right to criticise me for losing my job when I lost my education to caring for her child. I’m trying to get in contact with my nieces stepfather to ask him for his opinion. 

Edit 2: yes, I was asked by my mom to drop out of school and I did so. I didn’t go to college later. I had no intention of hurting my niece, but she had already overheard what was said so I felt that keeping it from her now would just cause her confusion. I’m now trying to backpedal the best I can with the families assistance, to be able to properly explain the situation to her. But, my sister and my mother both want to just pretend this never happened and hope my niece forgets as she grows up.

Edit 3: I’m starting to wish I was clearer from the beginning. I said I was 17 when my sister “had” the accidental pregnancy. I meant that I was 17 when the baby was born.

We’ve been divorced for 3+ years and she remarried 2+ years ago. We have legit 50/50 custody and split everything down the middle pretty well. We have built a good routine for co parenting and things have been smooth for the last few years without any hostility. If ever a time in the past where she had to leave for work she would ask me to watch them full time in her absence which u always do, happily. A few weeks ago she found out she’s deploying for 6 months overseas and asked if while she was gone her husband could kept the same routine 50/50. I said no, that I had assumed I would have full responsibility of them. This upset them and it’s been a huge discussion ever since. She says I’m not thinking of the kids, their stability, their happiness. I argue that I disagree and that what parent wouldn’t want the opportunity to have them full again even if for a temporary time. I tried to explain that just because they are with me that I won’t cut their other lives out completely. They don’t want to hear it. The husband tries to make demands, every solution I’ve come up with doesn’t work for him and I clearly the bad guy to them. I want to add that our custody agreement even states I get them if she deploys and we live in California. So even though I don’t think I’m in the wrong here, AITA?

EDIT: I want to clarify the biggest question that seems to be asked and the reason some feel I am TA. I have not told my kids about their mother deploying. I do not feel this is my position to. She will tell them when she is ready and I am respecting that. Of course I want to talk to my children about this and see what they think.

I set them up when I got home and a couple days later my neighbor was knocking on my door. She was demanding I take down my flamingos because they’re “extremely gauche” and “lowering the property value of the neighborhood”. I told her I am not taking them down because I like them, and the property value isn’t going to be hurt by two yard flamingos.

She has posted pictures of my house, the street I live on, and a close up of my flamingos in our towns Facebook group to complain about them. Some people agreed I should take them down. After that, another neighbor came over to tell me to get rid of them. My mom also agreed I should take them down to keep the peace with my neighbor. 

I like them, I smile when I see them when I pull into my driveway. I have no plans to take them down. 

AITA for not taking down my yard flamingos after some neighbors complained?

Edit: everyone keeps suggesting garden gnomes. I kinda hate those a lot 🙈 but also I’d never say anything to someone with a yard full of gnomes. But I won’t buy them.

1nvg74z,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to sell my house to a landlord?,"I bought a fixer-upper in my 20s with my now ex. I bought him out, but agreed to give him back his portion of deposit he paid upon sale whenever that may be. 

We remained friends as we've known eachother since childhood, regardless of that I still plan to stick to my work 8 years later.

I told him I was in the process of selling the house, he asked me if I had any offers and i told him yeah but from a few landlords. I didn't think that needed further explanation because he knows full well how I feel about landlords buying up starter homes in lower income areas, and how strongly I felt about turning this house into a home for myself and the next occupants.

He's absolutely furious at me for not going for a quick sale because he wants his measley 5k back _now_. I told him no way, and tried to remind him of all the offers we made on starter homes that just got swept up by landlords. It was devastating and we almost lost all hope of getting on the property ladder. None of them wanted this one because it needed so much work.

He's blowing my phone up, and told my parents who are more gently telling me to just go for the easy sale but I'm in no rush to move and want all my hard work to go to a family instead of someones business. AITA?

Edit: giving him the 5K specifically from the sale has been discussed over messages many times in the past. If I just give him 5k now, he could still say I owe him from the sale of the house. Getting him out was a nightmare as he can be pretty nasty. Most of the time he's fine but he suddenly switches and ""goes to war"" with people.",9141,0.93,9141,0,9885.0,744.0,802,1759343128.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nvg74z/aita_for_refusing_to_sell_my_house_to_a_landlord/,False,True
1oi51kf,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my dad I can’t see how his prank was funny?,"I(16) live with my mom and visit my dad every Saturday. Last Saturday was different though. He asked to meet outside for lunch instead of having me over.

When I ordered iced latte, he snorted. I asked him what’s so funny and he said he ‘pulled a prank’ on my stepmom. Now Dad enjoys these things. He used to play videos of cats in heat to see our male cat’s reaction to the sound, along with videos of dogs barking. Switched off the light when I was in the toilet several times. Once he put a snake plush next to my mom when she was sleeping, knowing she is terrified of snakes. A lot of shouting that day.

So I asked him what he did. He said he made her latte but with whole milk instead of her usual oat milk, knowing she is vegan. Wanted to see if she would be able to tell. She got really upset at him, hence why he asked to meet outside.

Then Dad said to me ‘That’s funny, right?’ And I just pulled a face and said ‘Don’t think so, Dad.’ Because I couldn’t see how it’s funny. He looked annoyed and said that ‘people these days can’t take a joke.’ Told me that I’m his son and supposed to side with him, saying I shouldn’t be judgmental since it was ‘harmless.’",9107,0.97,9107,0,9398.0,291.0,571,1761644835.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oi51kf/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_cant_see_how_his_prank/,False,True
1j9dagd,AmItheAsshole,AITA for taking an Uber home instead of sitting on a man’s lap?,"So my best friend (Sarah, F22) recently got a new boyfriend (James, M23) and she is over the moon into him. Sarah is one of the very few people I hangout with. She recently just met James’ friend group, a group of guys, and they invited her to go on a beach trip with them. Sarah begged me to go with and kept insisting I join even when I declined the offer about 4 times. Eventually, I just agreed to go to get her off my back about being sad and alone. 

I was told that I would have a ride. Sarah and I were the last to be picked up, and when they pull up, there are four guys in a five passenger car. I see this as my way out. I say, “oh! Looks like there isn’t enough room for both of us. You can go enjoy the beach with your boyfriend, I don’t mind staying behind.” Sarah tells me that it isn’t a big deal if she has to sit on James’ lap to make it work. Immediately I feel on edge. 

Turns out, James was the one driving and said he wouldn’t trust anyone else to drive his car. He told me that I would be the one sitting on someone’s lap because there’s no way that he would let Sarah do that. I don’t know these guys at all. I pull Sarah aside and tell her that im uncomfortable, thinking that she would help me out. Instead she encourages me, saying that she thinks I would have fun and maybe even get a date. 

She is so into James and has been talking about this trip nonstop for over a week, so I decided to just do it to make her happy. 

Two of the three guys in the back (Sarah sits up front next to James) offer up their laps. I just pick the guy with the most leg room. We live about 45 minutes from the nearest beach so I thought it wouldn’t be too bad, except that I was told ON THE DRIVE that we were actually going to a beach an hour and a half away instead. My mood just becomes more and more sour. I never once relax, and eventually find myself quietly fuming once my emotions set in. 

The boys that I am squeezed into the back with just talk around me, physically leaning over me constantly, brushing up against me. Once we get to the beach, we set up and I finally find a moment to relax. I eat a sandwich I packed and read a book while sarah and James are lovey dovey and the guys mess around in the ocean. I was asked TWICE about why I only packed a sandwich for myself. Not jokingly either. Not once had I been asked to bring a single thing. 

When it came to the part where everyone was getting in the car, I just told James and Sarah that I had called an uber to pick me up because I didn’t want to sit on anyone’s lap for another hour and a half. Sarah tried to argue, but my ride showed up, so I left.

I got a call from Sarah a few hours later. She called me a bad friend for ditching everyone. When I told her how the whole day was making me feel shitty, she told me I was being selfish and that I had been acting like a bitch all day. I do not think I deserve that, but I am also pretty paranoid that I did something wrong.

As dinner was being served, they casually offered me some mutton curry. I politely declined and reminded them that I’m vegetarian and would stick to cottage cheese curry and flat bread. I thought that would be the end of it. But no—just moments later, they again insisted I take some non-veg, as if my earlier response didn’t even matter.

At that point, I firmly told them that I found it disrespectful and that it actually hurt my sentiments. The room got a little awkward, but honestly, I felt like I had to say something. My friends who were invited as well told me that I was rude while refusing the food for the second time. They also mentioned I should have not called the host disrespectful during the conversation.

1hgsnrf,AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking why I was left off a family photo collage?,"My in-laws are celebrating their 30th anniversary. My wife &amp; all her siblings decided to get a large framed photo collage for them as a present.

The collage, of course, has their wedding pictures &amp; and pictures of my wife &amp; her siblings as children. The collage also includes the most recent group photo of their whole family together at our wedding back in April. Additionally, the collage also has (seperate) pictures of her 3 married brothers with their wives &amp; children, &amp; a picture of her recently-engaged brother &amp; his fiancée.

However, there is no picture of me &amp; my wife, nor do I appear in any of the group pictures, not even in the family pic from our wedding.

I brought this to my wife's attention, &amp; her immediate &amp; annoyed sounding response was, ""It's not about you. It's about my parents and my family &amp; the grandkids.""

I said, ""I understand, &amp; I'm not saying it's about me, but I'm wondering, if there's pictures of your married brothers with their wives, shouldn't there also be one of us?"" Her response was, ""It's not about my married brothers &amp; their wives, it's to show off the grandkids!""

""Okay. What about the pic of [newly engaged brother] &amp; [fiancée]? There's no grandkids to show off there...""

At this point my wife gets upset. ""You know, you're really annoying me right now. My siblings &amp; I worked really hard to put this together, &amp; now you have to make it ALLLL about you &amp; the fact that you're not on it. Grow up. You'll be in other pictures in the future.""

Now truthfully, I don't really care that much about not being in the collage, but I am feeling very hurt and frustrated by my wife's response.

1jboy2w,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting my husband attend his sister’s wedding?,"
My husband (31M) and myself (28F) are expecting our first child this May, 2025. We found out very early in September, 2024. We did not keep this a secret from anyone and in fact, shared the news in person with his family and my family on the day we found out. During this period, his sister (29F) was getting to know someone and getting engaged in October 2024. It’s sort of an arranged marriage as she was set up and decided to get engaged only after 3 months of speaking to the guy. Her parents (my in-laws) were happy that she liked him and wanted to quickly move forward. She’s been wanting to get married for the past 5 years. 

After the engagement party in October, there was a brief discussion of when the wedding would be. His sister had mentioned that she wanted to be married by no later than April 2025. After our initial OB visit in September, my husband had mentioned to his parents that I would not be able to travel after 34 weeks as per the doctor. His mother decided to ignore this information and not address it. His sister and mother decided to plan on having the wedding in April 2025 even though they had not booked anything. His sister’s fiancé lives in Texas, a 3.5 hrs flight away. I briefly mentioned that I would not be able to attend in April as it would be too close to my due date but wished them all the best in their planning. 

February 2025 rolls around and they decided to have the wedding this upcoming April 19th of 2025 in Texas. I tell my husband that because I will be almost 37 weeks pregnant, that we would definitely not be able to go. A month prior, during a huge fight we had, his mom had told him it’s okay if I don’t go but that he would have to attend. At the time, I was not opposed to it, as I thought it would be fine.

Two weeks ago, we met with my OB, and I decide to ask her for advice while he was also in the room. I ask her for confirmation that it’s not a problem if he were to travel during my 37th week. She looks at both of us and says “Absolutely not” we both stare at her shocked and she continues and says “this would be like rolling a dice, I would not recommend it. If something were to happen, I would not be able to slow anything down.” He unenthusiastically agrees and says it’s messed up that they picked a date knowing we most likely would not be able to attend. 

It’s now almost April, and he just told his mother that we will both for sure not be able to attend. My husband and in-laws have a huge fight and he explains the situation so his dad threatens that he wouldn’t attend either if he’s not at the wedding. I don’t budge after he tells me this and calmly state that he simply cannot attend two weeks before my due date as we’re both having this baby together. 

So, AITA for not letting him attend his sister’s wedding? 


UPDATE: My in-laws have guilted him into rethinking his decision. I have an OB appointment two days before the wedding. He’s now planning on booking a ticket and deciding last minute if he’s going to attend the day before the wedding. He would fly out at 12pm on the day of, to make it in time for the main event and fly out the next morning at 7am. I honestly don’t know how to feel about this other than disappointment and fear of abandonment at such a vulnerable stage. My worry is that if it happens, he won’t make it in time because there are no flights between 6pm and 7am. To make myself feel better, I’m also trying to ration with myself about the likelihood of going into labour within less than 24hours at almost 37 weeks. Thank you all for your supportive messages, it feels good knowing that others see my perspective. 

UPDATE 2: Yes he went. I spent the time he was away with my mom and best friend (both decided to not attend the wedding) I did not move from the couch until he came back in fear of going into labour. His family called him on the phone nonstop until he got on a flight. I had booked him a 12:30pm flight so he arrived three hours before the event and he was on the 8am flight back the next day. My sisters were invited to the wedding and they told me that he refused to sit on his family’s table and that he did not speak to any of them all night long. He also refused to dance or be a part of the wedding. I sent his mother a very long text message explaining why I’ll never forgive her and that I will carry it with me forever.

He made it back and I did actually end up getting an emergency C-section a couple of days later. My baby is now here and he’s perfect in every way possible.

1lfhxlp,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling out my sister in law for using her children to emotionally manipulate me into going to dinner “now” instead of waiting 45 minutes?,"This happened 2 weeks ago. I am 32 and my spouse is 29. My spouse and their family (parents, sister, her kids) were hanging out. I was doing some chalk art with the kids while my spouse caught up with everyone. We had a very light lunch and some snacks for everyone to graze while hanging out.

The time for dinner started to approach and my sister in law brought up heading down for dinner. I said that it was only 5:15 and we should wait until 6:00. She said she would like to go now. I said we should just wait and go at 6 because I had a coupon and there would be deals to make the meal much cheaper. The difference being from estimated $175 to under $75. We had already offered to pay for dinner before they arrived.

My sister in law grumbled about it and went to check on the kids and their chalk stuff. I didn’t think 45 minutes would be such a big deal. But a few minutes later the kids, who were fine a few minutes ago, came to the patio and were dramatically clutching their stomachs and saying “I’m soooooo hungry”

This annoyed me. I don’t like it when people use their kids to emotionally manipulate others. I think it’s pathetic. My MIL and FIL were easily swayed and said “Oh, well, let’s just get ready and head down anyway, it’ll be fine.”

I looked at my spouse and they said we could just wait, but their sister said no, and started to get the kids ready to go out. I was super annoyed at this and while the kids ran inside, I turned to her and said “Using your children to emotionally manipulate people into getting your way is pathetic.”

She said “everyone is hungry, just get over it, if you couldn’t afford to pay for dinner then you shouldn’t have offered.” I do get she has a point that we offered, but is asking for just 45 minutes seriously that big of a deal to have her try to use her kids like that? I would think most family would want to help each other save a little money. Am i wrong?

1nkeftb,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to educate a kid about my wheelchair.,"Hey everyone, 

I(39F) temporarily have to use a wheelchair for longer distances due to a currently undiagnosed issue with my leg. 
My PT advised me to use one, and my husband rented a nice, small wheelchair for me. 
I'm able to roll myself (good workout) and did some training and manoeuvres in our local shopping centre. 

I visited an small zoo last weekend, with my husband.
My husband was getting coffee and I was waiting outside the restaurant. 
A kid (age 7? Idk, not good with ages) and his dad, got curious about my wheelchair. 
I understand that kids get curious and want to ask questions, but I barely understand why I'm in a wheelchair currently. I was really not in the mood to explain my issues or be educational about it. 
So I just mentioned that sometimes someones leg doesn't work. 
Cue to more questions and I said that I didn't want to answer more questions because I was tired. 
The kids dad wasn't pleased with that respons and mentioned that it was a good lesson for the kid. 
Now, I basically wanted to tell him that I'm not a zoo attraction. 
But there was a kid, and I didn't want to make a drama. Luckily my husband showed up with coffee and rolled me away. 

Tldr 
Kid asks questions about my wheelchair. I didn't want to educate the kid about my wheelchair. His dad didn't like that. 

AITA 
For not wanting to educate a kid about my wheelchair.

1i1ozwb,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to let my roommate's cat into my room after it 'apologized'?,"I (27F) share an apartment with my roommate, Lily (26F), who has a cat named Muffin. Muffin is adorable but has a habit of sneaking into my room and knocking things over. Last week, I came home to find Muffin had somehow gotten in and destroyed a puzzle I had spent hours working on. Pieces were scattered everywhere, some were chewed up, and one was lost entirely. I was furious.

I told Lily that Muffin needed to stay out of my room, and she agreed, but she also said Muffin felt bad and wanted to apologize. I laughed it off, assuming she was joking. The next day, I found a little note on my desk written in Lily’s handwriting that said, 'I’m sowwy – Muffin.' Along with it was a cat treat.

I thought it was funny but didn’t change my stance. Since then, Lily has been passive-aggressively saying things like, 'Muffin’s just trying to make things right,' or 'You’re holding a grudge against a cat.' She even suggested that I let Muffin into my room supervised so she can 'earn back my trust.'

I told her no and that I wasn’t interested in giving her cat another chance to destroy my stuff.

1nf3yka,AmItheAsshole,AITAH for not completely changing my kids life just do accommodate her father?,"I (35f) was with my ex Tom (40m) for a few years before having our daughter 10f, when she was a few weeks old he moved out and in with some other girl and has rarely been involved. I finally put him on child support a few years ago and you’d think he was father of the year for paying $300 a month. He never really had custody, I NEVER kept her from him but I wasn’t going to chase him around trying to force him to be involved. 

Last year he remarried Peggy (45f) and is now asking for more custody. Obviously I talked to my daughter’s therapist and agreed to every other weekend for now, I’m not forcing my kid to change her life just because Tom now wants to play family. 

The problem is that Tom and Peggy’s house is just miserable for my daughter. I’m trying to keep her positive about it but honestly? They’re just not the kind of people or behaviors she’s used to. They yell a lot, don’t care about hygiene or keeping a clean house (nothing CPS would do anything about but does not meet normal standards much less mine), and she hates Peggy’s kids. There are five but two are older and on their own, but she has a son 17, daughter 12 and a son my daughter’s age and they’re basically feral. Just no supervision over there, always on their phones, so structure. Oh, and Peggy is an antivaxxer so there's that whole situation. My daughter plays soccer and they were 45 minutes late to the game last weekend and didn't think it was that big of a deal! She was texting me freaking out that she'd be late and when I called Tom he screamed at ME for calling.
 
Tom and Peggy also live out in the boonies, it's about a 25-30min drive from my house to theirs. I told him when he started coming around that I had no intention of driving hours or changing any aspects of our lives to accommodate him and he promised it wouldn't be a problem. Now here we are, and he's saying we need to set up a meeting point or switch off hand overs. I'm already pissed that my daughter needs to be in a car for so long just because Peggy ""needs to have a lot of property."" I told him no way, he was the one that chose to live so far from us, he can do the driving.
 
Finally, his most outrageous request has been to TAKE MY KID OUT OF HER SCHOOL. She got into our district's competitive magnet school, it's not easy and we both worked hard for it (me just filling out the forms and setting up meetings, she got in on her own merits). Tom says that his stepkids (that apparently he's adopting btw lol) are jealous of what my daughter gets to do at school and he wants to enroll her in their public school. NOT happening. 
 
My daughter has male role models, ones who actually care about her well-being and not just social media clout. Tom can say he'll go to court but I'll believe that when I see it, he has no gumption and honestly I doubt a judge would side with him anyways. I have always had full custody, have never kept her from him, but need to stick up for my kid... but does that make me the AH?

We were neighbors, went to the same school, college, etc. She was my MoH when I married ""Rowan"" (28m), who we went to college with. At first, Kira had a big crush on him, but he started liking me. We slowly got closer and I started liking him too (this was after Kira had told me she'd gotten over it and was dating another guy). But I still felt really guilty and didn't want to date him if it would hurt Kira. I asked her multiple times if she was okay with it and she said she was, so I thought it was fine.

Kira's been with her latest boyfriend, ""Adam"" (27m), for a year or so. However, over the last few months, she's been acting strange around Rowan. Whenever we'd be hanging out with the three of us, or even with Adam there, she'd always find some way to sit next to Rowan, laugh at everything he said, etc. I didn't think anything of it initially because I knew that's kind of her personality, and her and Rowan are friends. But then she started always asking me if Rowan was there before she came over and if I said no, she'd often suddenly say she couldn't come, though sometimes she would say that even if I said he was here. Rowan also told me about a comment she made to him once about how he was so patient for putting up with me being ""too tired to do anything with him"" now that I was pregnant, which I thought was weird.

The odd behavior continued but tbh the pregnancy had been keeping me too exhausted to give it a lot more thought, and Rowan seemed as friendly with Kira as always. But two days ago, our mutual friend ""Shay"" threw a dinner party. Me and Rowan went, as did Kira and Adam. Kira got a bit tipsy, and she kept trying to sit with Rowan and touch him. He excused himself a few times but she kept finding him. I tried to get her off a few times, and I was getting mad because this was a new line she was crossing. She was slurring about how I ""stole Rowan from her"". Thankfully Adam was too busy talking to Shay's husband to hear this, but he definitely saw Kira's actions.

The next afternoon, I was at Shay's again with some friends when Kira showed up. She was crying about how Adam had broken up with her that day, saying he didn't think they were going to work out. Everyone was consoling her, but I was just kind of sitting there. I couldn't help but feel like she brought this upon herself. She asked me ""Aren't you going to say something?"" so I said ""Maybe Adam wouldn't have left you if you weren't trying to get with Rowan all the time"". Some of our other friends were shocked to hear this and got mad at Kira. Some got angry with me, saying Kira was just really friendly with everyone and that was a horrible accusation to make.

Kira was upset, saying she couldn't believe I thought that of her and maybe we really weren't that close. She left in tears and I left soon after too. Now I don't know, maybe I was wrong? Kira had been drinking at the dinner party and might not have meant what she said, and the other stuff could've been nothing. Maybe this was too harsh to say to her after a breakup and we could've talked privately, not in front of our friends.

1jlizx7,AmItheAsshole,WIBTA if I refused to give up a water fountain the previous homeowners abandoned 4 years ago?,"In September 2021, we purchased a home that was built in 2019 &amp; we moved in immediately. The previous owners (PO) left a few things at the home, including a water fountain.  Within the first month, the PO asked if they could collect the fountain, we said that was fine, but they never came. It’s now March/April of 2025, 4 years later, and has been sitting in the front yard.  Over the last 2 years I have been organizing, prepping, and designing my front garden where it will be incorporated into my design. 
I am an avid gardener and decided to redo the garden, but haven’t yet planted any thing. It’s has taken me a while to actually get started for multiple reasons. The first year we were settling in. 2nd year I had to learn about the seasons (I’m from FL, we don’t have seasons) research native plants, best planting times, amongst other things.  The most important reason was because the house was built poorly and we had to repair an entire wall that was in the main section of the garden. There is no point for me to plant when we will be doing construction work. After we finished the exterior part of the wall, winter started. 

The roof still needs repairs, but I have access to the area now. I planned on power washing, repairing, and painting the water fountain this weekend, but I got covid and again delayed. I dismantled the fountain and relocated it to various places to be worked on. 

Suddenly, the PO messaged my husband stating he wants the water fountain back, it’s his 45th anniversary soon and it was his wife’s 35th anniversary present. Stating he’ll be by this weekend to get it. I told my husband to inform the PO that I’m no longer willing to part with it. PO, states it’s not mine to ‘part with’ and he’ll be by to pick it up.  It has been on our property for 4 years. It’s considered abandoned property after 30 days, we gave him the chance to pick it up, but they didn’t. We’re not a storage unit. What claim is it his to come get it? I understand it was an anniversary gift but clearly he didn’t care enough to get it in the last 4 years. 

This house was brand new, but terribly built by the PO.  Everything that could be wrong is wrong. Roof is missing edge pieces, subfloor is uneven causing the entire floor to be uneven with gaps in all the wood, the ENTIRE house needs new siding because they installed the Hardy Board incorrectly and now falling off, 4 different colors &amp; textures of caulk used in the backsplash of kitchen, screws popping out of every single wall in the house, studs aren’t 16” on center. The list goes on and on. We literally have to rebuild the house from bottom up. Before you ask, yes we had an inspector but no he didn’t catch these things.  We’re also trapped in the house because we bought during the VID times and the interest rates were very low.  So, moving isn’t an option. Trust me, we would if we could. 

So, AITA for not giving up the water fountain 4 years after he sold us a terribly built home?

1hiffkk,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a mom that I don't care about her daughter being dumped by my son?,"My son Dylan dated ""Melanie"" since the 10th grade. They are now juniors. Dylan dumped her last week and Melanie took it hard. I got a text yesterday from Melanie's mom to call her. She wanted me to bring back Melanie's sweater that she left at our house a couple of weeks ago. I said sure.

I told her she could pick it up. The mom came and said that I should talk to Dylan about how much he hurt Melanie. Melanie was very attached to my son and my son broke up with her in the ""wrong way.""

I told her I wasn't talking to my son about anything. They're high schoolers and stuff like this happens all the time and Melanie isn't special. My son doesn't owe you or Melanie an apology for not wanting to date her anymore. 

Dylan wasn't mean about it. He just said that he didn't want to be in a relationship because he wanted to spend more time with his friends. The mom said that was bs. I said I don't care. He doesn't need a reason. It's none of your business.

She asked me if I cared about how my son treated his girlfriends. I said do you care how your daughter treat their boyfriends? She said it was different. I told her I had nothing left to say except I don't care about her or her daughter.

1kydarz,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for leaving my SIL’s house after she invited me over to ""not be alone"" but just wanted free childcare?","I (25F) had to put my cat down unexpectedly, and it has completely shattered me. He wasn’t “just a pet” — he was my best friend, my emotional support, my companion through everything. I’ve had him since I was a teenager, and I loved him more than I can explain. Making the decision to let him go was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I held him in my arms at the vet while he passed, and I genuinely don’t know how I made it home after. I cried all night. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t eat. I took the next day off work because I couldn’t even function — I was in absolute pieces.

That day, my sister-in-law called and said she didn’t want me to be alone, and invited me to come over. I was hesitant but also grateful that someone seemed to care. I thought I’d be able to just sit quietly, cry a little, maybe talk about him if I needed to — basically just *exist* around someone so I wasn’t drowning by myself.

But the moment I got there, it was clear that “not being alone” actually meant helping her with her kids. We immediately left to pick them up from school. Her son didn’t want to get off the jungle gym, and when I just stood there, SIL got annoyed that I wasn’t physically removing him — even though I could barely stand upright without crying.

Back at her place, she told her son I would help him with homework while she made dinner. I tried to gently bring up my cat once or twice — I honestly just needed to talk about him — and each time she cut me off with “you’re just having a moment” or said we didn’t need to dwell. I felt completely dismissed.

Then her son needed help in the bathroom and she asked *me* to do it. I don’t know if she realized, but I’d been crying on and off the entire time I was there. I hadn’t been able to think straight since yesterday. I wasn’t even sure why I agreed to come. And now I was being asked to play babysitter, while grieving the most traumatic loss I’ve ever experienced?

At that point, I just stood up and left. I didn’t say much — I didn’t trust myself not to sob or scream. I just got in my car and went home.

Later she texted me saying I upset her kids by “storming out” and that she was trying to *help me take my mind off things*. But I don’t think she ever actually saw how much pain I was in.

1mbgu22,AmItheAsshole,AITA for sending Child Maintenance statements to my ex-MIL,"I (35f) split up with my ex just over a year ago. We had some issues with getting him to provide for our son (now 8). His parents were very much interested in the drama. When I made an application through official ""Child Maintenance Service"" and he received a schedule listing his monthly payments. His parents contacted me asking to agree to an unofficial payment plan, because the CMS amount was just too much, claiming that getting a lower amount agreed between us was better than not receiving a single penny through CMS. I refused, deciding that having this agreement on paper and not receiving it would still be better than *maybe* getting something.

My ex didn't make a single payment and *lost his job* shortly after. His child maintenance amount was recalculated granting him payments of £7-ish/week, which he still refused to pay, which then caused the CMS to collect the money themselves and charging him (and me) some extra fees for the service. His parents were very much aware of it, and complained about it, especially about the fees \[he gets charged 20%\] and about the arrears that are still on the account.

I'm sorry for the long intro, but I find it important.

To the issue- it was my son's birthday last week. I took time off and took him on a 2 short stay at one of the UK's theme parks. When his dad and his family found out I received a call from his mother complaining that now that I live off her poor son I can afford taking my kid to trips like this and making his dad look bad in comparison. \[for context- we've been to multiple theme parks over the years, including last year, when my ex still refused to pay a penny for his son\]. I couldn't help but laugh \[in hindsight, I appreciate that it was immature, I just couldn't collect my self quickly enough\] and told her not to contact me about this ""issue"" again.

Well, she messaged me shortly after. I received a wall of text basically telling me off for making her son struggle, when I spent his money on memories and making myself look like the better parent.

I couldn't take the bs and took two screenshots:

1. holiday booking confirmation (including hotel, park tickets etc)
2. Total Child Maintenance payments received in the last year

I sent it to her with a note: ""Has your poor son sponsored our trip or has he taken active part in providing for \[son's name\] over the last year? You can't claim both. Pick one, please.""

In response I received more angry messages from both ex-MIL upset about being called out like that, and from my ex, who was angry that I got his mother involved and that I pointed out how bad he is at providing for our son.

I don't think I got her involved, but my opinion may be skewed, so here I am, asking: Reddit- AITA?



EDIT: I thought I'd edit the post to answer the most repeated question:

I've been in touch with my ex in-laws solely to allow them to stay in touch with my son. They have a good relationship with him, but they struggle to make arrangements with my ex to have proper grandparent- grandchild time during my ex's custody times. It's worked quite well in the last months.   
  
I do agree with you guys- this incident just made me want to ~~seize~~ cease all contact with my exMIL and I will contact them letting them know that from now on I'd like them to make alternative visitation arrangements between themselves, so I can have some peace and quiet. Your comments about being TA to myself made me realise that in attempts to keep my child happy and have contact with his extended family I've given them too much freedom to try to butt in and comment on my own life.",8775,0.96,8775,0,9157.0,382.0,306,1753710917.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mbgu22/aita_for_sending_child_maintenance_statements_to/,False,True
1kh50ec,AmItheAsshole,UPDATE: AITA for refusing to take my low functioning sister out with me and my other sister?,"UPDATE: Almost two years later

Hey, so… I forgot I even made this post until I was going through old screenshots. Life got busy, a lot happened, and I never came back to update. But since the post reached a lot of people and honestly helped me more than I expected, I figured I’d share how things turned out.

Yes, Missy and I went on our trip. It was amazing. Just the two of us, blasting music, grabbing fast food, staying up late talking, and doing normal sibling stuff without pressure. We both really needed it. I told my parents Macy wasn’t coming. They weren’t thrilled, especially my dad, but they didn’t stop us.

When I got home, we had a real conversation. I told them everything: how I felt invisible growing up, how Missy was starting to feel the same way, and how our whole world revolved around Macy. I said I wouldn’t be her future caregiver. That was when their tone changed. They said Macy would always be their priority. That told me everything I needed to know.

A few days later, I moved out. It wasn’t dramatic; we all kind of quietly agreed it was time. I started college early and finally got some space.

College has been life-changing. I started therapy, which helped me work through guilt and stress I didn’t realize I had. I’ve made new friends and started figuring out who I am outside of my family. I still go home sometimes. I still love Macy. That was never the issue. I just needed to choose myself too.

Missy’s doing better now. She’s more vocal and plans to leave for college soon. My parents and I are civil, but it’s different. They’ve started looking into long-term care options for Macy, and they know I won’t be stepping into that role.

Thanks to everyone who read or commented on the original post. You helped more than you know. If you’re going through something similar, just know you’re not selfish. Choosing yourself is okay.

We live in Germany where I work in an English-speaking environment, so to get extra practice in, I told him that after x date, we'd switch to German, which he is fluent in (grew up here). We've managed two days so far, where even if he accidentally says something in English I answer in German, but last night he told me he needed a break from me speaking German. I refused, and said it's only for 10 weeks until my exam, then I'll go back to English. He says I don't sound like his wife when I speak German. I asked if it was because my mistakes were jarring or my vocab was causing issues. He said it just 'didn't feel like he was speaking to his wife'. I think it's vital that I stick to my plan, to get my speaking practice in. He seemed a bit sad after I said no.

1jrpde7,personalfinance,Wife and I got married in 2022. Our wedding venue called us this week to say we still owe $7000 dollars.,"As stated in the title we got a call from our wedding venue saying that they found a cashier's check from us in a lockbox after doing an internal audit. The venue has a website portal that says everything has been paid (since before the actual wedding). Their rep says the check was never endorsed so it was never cashed. Now they're asking us to pay again.

It's my understanding that venues won't even let you have the wedding unless everything is paid up. I don't understand how they could have possibly made a $7000 mistake. 

With the way cashier's checks work, that money was gone as soon as the check was made. Not sure what to do since we definitely don't want to pay double for the venue's mistake.

EDIT:

We went through all of our statements for that year and the funds were never returned to our account. The venue also sent us a copy of both sides of the check showing that it doesn't have an endorsement signature. So, that's basically proof that they got it from us. The check says VOID AFTER 90 DAYS, so that's probably why they are asking for the money now. My wife and I will go to the bank to see if it can be reissued. It's really annoying that we have to jump through these hoops.",10990,0.98,10990,0,11219.0,229.0,492,1743807973.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jrpde7/wife_and_i_got_married_in_2022_our_wedding_venue/,False,True
1n96stx,personalfinance,"$20k raise, but only $100 more per paycheck","This is more of a warning than anything else. Make sure to check the fine print of your benefits summaries beforehand.

I recently accepted a job offer that brought a $20k raise, and significantly more management duties.

I, of course, checked benefit cost prior to accepting, and found it acceptable. The issue came on my second check, when my benefits cost was double the expected amount.

Turns out, they charge a spousal fee for each program, which is significant. My previous employer did not charge this.

This, alongside the new tax burden, means I make a whopping $100 more on my paycheck, plus a few cents.

In addition, I foolishly accepted verbal confirmation that the company contributed to HSA. They do not. So this will probably be a net loss in the long run when healthcare costs come up.

Not complaining, as I should have caught this in the fine print, just a forewarning to others.

1kn4xsn,personalfinance,"Chase only applied $23 of my $23,000 credit card payment.. now they’re reversing it and I’m stuck. Please help.","Hi everyone, I really need some advice or insight. About a month ago, I made a large payment of $23,000 to my Chase Freedom Unlimited card to pay off my balance. But when the payment posted, Chase only credited me $23.00.

I immediately reached out through their secure message center for a written record. Since then, it’s been a back and forth for almost two months. Chase asked me to provide:

	•	A full bank statement showing the withdrawal
	•	A fax of my payment confirmation and transmittal report
	•	An official letterhead statement from my bank confirming the payment

I provided everything they asked for, including confirmation that the funds were withdrawn by Chase on March 17, 2025. Today, they messaged me saying they couldn’t verify the payment and reversed the temporary credit they had applied during the investigation.

I’ve contacted my bank (Wells Fargo), and they’ve confirmed multiple times that the full $23,000 was sent to Chase. They even offered to speak to Chase directly and gave me a letter on official letterhead to back it up.

I’ve now filed a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but I’m scared. My money is in limbo, I feel like I’m getting the runaround, and no one is taking accountability.

Could this be a rare glitch or tech issue? Did my bank mess up? Is Chase ignoring the evidence? I don’t know what else to do, and this is incredibly stressful. If anyone has experience with something similar or has advice, I’d be grateful.

**** UPDATE #1: Hi.. just wanted to give an update! Thanks to all the advice, I filed a complaint with my OCC and State’s General Attorney. I posted on my socials just complaining lol and Chase reached out via X and suddenly forwarded my case to the Executive Team. I spoke with someone over the phone (they called me) and they said all they need is the ACH trace number and proof it left my bank account and they will continue the investigation. 

I was having a hard time with calling them myself, it was either they hung up multiple times or they would tell me to send documents and then send me an email saying the same thing, that they “exhausted all their resources” so they would leave my case closed. 

I also went into the branch on Monday and all they could do was call the online service team and basically do the same thing I did but I sent the documents through the branch via fax and email from a Chase location. 

I did as much as I possible could before needing to acquire any legal help, I’ll keep you guys updated on what happens after I send the documents to the executive team.

1mgqrp1,personalfinance,"My former sorority is telling me I owe thousands in debt, and has destroyed my credit score. I have no idea what to do.","Not sure if this falls under credit or debt. Really not sure what to do here at all.

For reference, I am 23, I graduated college a few months ago. My freshman year, I joined a sorority. Had a horrible time, but was living in the house, so couldn’t resign until the end of my sophomore year. But I paid all of my dues and rent during that period of time. I submitted the paperwork and severed all ties.

It’s been a few years since then. I recently received a letter saying I owe about $3,000 in unpaid dues to my sorority—or more specifically, to a debt collector. And despite my dues having been tied to my mom’s bank account, this debt has showed up on *my* account, and tanked my credit. I guess I’m grateful that *she* doesn’t have to deal with this, but I have no idea what to do. I can’t get approved for a credit card, I can’t get approved for an apartment without a guarantor. 

I brought it up to my mom, who is insistent that we don’t pay this, because we don’t owe it. And having seen a couple similar posts, it does look like sometimes they might just hit you with more charges after you pay the first one. I’ve also been told that debt collectors will fold relatively easily. But I have no idea what to do, and neither does she.

It seems like the bureaucracy element of this is gone, because 1) this collector bought my debt, so I’m negotiating with them, not the sorority itself, and 2) my sorority's chapter actually shut down last year. Do I talk to nationals? Do I get a lawyer? What kind? How do I restore my credit?

extra note re: paperwork: I'm worried they're going to say that I didn't submit all of the necessary paperwork. But when I tried to log into the account where it would be held, it basically said my account didn't exist... I imagine because I dropped years ago. (Or because they got shut down.) But I don't know how to provide proof, or if I'd even need to.

Worst case scenario, either because I can't prove otherwise or because I truly overlooked something, what if I did overlook one piece of paperwork? I had no involvement with them for several years.

1jo8uo2,personalfinance,My friend lent me 5k in 2019. I want to now return it with decent interest,"A few years ago I was struggling during a career change and a good friend of mine offered some financial support (5kEUR) during my darkest days. It's not much, but back then it was the only thing that kept the roof over my head. He never asked for his money back and time just kept on rolling. Now I'm fortunate to say I'm doing a lot better.

I'm planning to return the sum at the end of 2025Q2, after I'm done with my company's taxes. I want this to feel as if he had put the money into a stable financial instrument with good, steady performance over the timespan of 6 years (2019Q2 --&gt; 2025Q2). How much should I return?

**UPDATE:**  
I’d like to wholeheartedly thank everyone for their input! I honestly didn’t expect this simple question to attract so much activity.

I think I’ve settled for 7500 – it feels like the perfect middle ground (7% annual return). I want to be considerate and reasonable, while at the same time managing the risk of my friend refusing the extra interest. Just like several people commented, I went to check the S&amp;P500 for the period. However, if I return double the amount or even more on top, I’m sure he’ll refuse it. And if that happens, I’ll have to endure a lengthy argument with him to give in and at least account for inflation.

Is there risk of him getting offended? I don’t think so. He’s financially savvy, managing a well-balanced personal portfolio. I think he would find it thoughtful.

My question was concerned only with the financial aspect of things. Of course, as many of you suggested, I would accompany the transaction with a nice gesture and plenty of gratitude. My friend is well off. He’s the type of person you can’t get a gift, since he has absolutely everything he needs. Taking him to a nice dinner won’t work. If I wire him the money the same day, there’s no way he’s letting me pay for dinner. So, I’m most likely taking him to some sort of adventurous event/experience where I can pay in advance.

Also, thanks everyone for the kind words towards me! That was unexpected. Now I’m worried my friend might stumble upon this thread 😅

My dad passed in late 2023 and my mom, who is unfortunately not financially literate and never handled any of their finances, just alerted me to a final notice sent in the mail to my dad for my student loans.

I graduated in 2018 and had some federal loans (30k) under my name that I’ve been paying off. My dad handled all of my school payments and I’m just now finding out it was through loans that he took out only in his name. 65k worth. Now with interest, over 90k. 

My name isn’t anywhere on the loan as a co-signer or anything and doesn’t show up on any of my credit reports or anything right now, but he clearly took it out for my schooling because it shows the years I was in college and my university. 

We are sending them his death certificate so he stops getting notices but am I now on the hook for this 90k?  How does this work? 

I dont want to sound ignorant or spoiled, I’m very conscious school costs a lot and many people are in student debt… I just didn’t know I was that deep in? I thought my dad had paid for it outright. If I had known about them, I would’ve been paying them off over the last 7 years and made a lot of different decisions… 


Edit (10/21): thank you all so much for the tips, insight, support, and kind words. My dad always did everything he could to help and protect us and some of these comments have made me think that he may have been smart and really known what he was doing here. 

I will update here once we have a resolution in case anyone’s in a similar boat. 

Our action plan (I think they were parent plus loans given they were through the federal government and serviced by Nelnet)
1. Send the death certificate back to the lender.

1jrcyww,personalfinance,I just had my first experience filing with FreeTaxUSA,"My go to since I've been filing (over 10 years) has been with TurboTax and I was honestly a fan.  It's easy to use and very well built in terms of interface and guidance through the overall tax process.

I don't have anything bad to say about the software but I hate the company behind it because they lobby against making any real progress on making the tax process more approachable so that they can stay relevant.

1il2r0z,personalfinance,I Spent Years Optimizing My Finances—Then I Realized What I Was Missing,"For a long time, I believed that if I just saved and invested wisely, everything else would fall into place. I tracked my spending, optimized my ETF portfolio, and avoided unnecessary expenses. I told myself I was building for the future—financial freedom, options, security.

And in many ways, I was. But then I noticed something:

While my bank balance grew, my life wasn’t necessarily getting better.

I put off trips because I wanted to save more.
I hesitated to buy a new mattress, even though my old one sucked.
I skipped social events because I thought they were a “waste” of money.

At first, it felt responsible. Then it felt empty.

I was optimizing for security, not for happiness. And security is only half the equation.

So, I started making small changes:

I bought a quality mattress because good sleep is an investment.

I traveled, not recklessly, but without overanalyzing every expense.

I let myself spend money on things that actually improved my life—not just my future net worth.


The crazy part? I didn’t regret any of it.

I still save. I still invest. But I also live. Because money is just a tool—and a tool you never use is useless.

I have no idea what to do. I do have some credit card debt but it has never gone to collections or anything like that. I have never received a letter, phone call, or email saying I owe someone money. I have a 750 credit score just for reference. This has to be a mistake right?
Oddly enough my mom had the same thing happen to one of her accounts as well. Please someone help me. 

I know my sister has about $10,000 worth or credit card debt, if not more. Perhaps it has something to do with her. And my mom does not have much debt either and none of it has gone into collections.

They said there is nothing they can do other than provide me the number for the company that took the money.

1hjdmif,personalfinance,I'm an idiot and zelle'd $5000 to the wrong person,"**First of all, I recognize how incredible careless and stupid I was in doing this... no excuses**.

Yesterday, in error I sent $5k to the wrong contact in my Chase app using Zelle. The contact is someone in town who owns a shop that I've made purchases from before. I immediately reached out to them on the phone and explained the error. They seemed understanding but wanted to call their bank, TD Bank, for advice on what to do next.

I was conferenced into the call with his bank and they basically said we had 2 options:

1. The recipient sends me the money back

or

2) He files a dispute with TD Bank but there was no guarantee I would recover my money.

After this call, the recipient and I agreed that he would send me the money back via Zelle, but he backtracked after speaking to a ""banking friend"" who advised him that I should go through Chase and make a claim stating the money was sent in error. The recipient then advised me that he was basically washing his hands of the situation and he has no obligation to help me further. (I want to believe he's afraid this is a scam and that he's not trying to pocket my money, considering he owns a legitimate business in town.)

So I called Chase and spoke to someone in the claims department who is filing a dispute that the money was sent in error. They told me that the process is basically Chase will reach out to TD Bank who will then reach out to the person to get the money back and that's where we are at this point.

I'm losing sleep over this situation as the money is basically my entire savings. Does anyone have any advice or maybe can share a similar story where they got their money back?

1jlni4u,personalfinance,Stop Using Rocket Money -- PLEASE!!,"Alright, prefacing this with this is a throwaway account.  
Hopefully this isn't breaking any rules, I read through them and don't think I'm breaking any rules.  
I am only posting this to protect you, the consumer, from potentially being scammed while trying to save money.

I work for a large company and often we will get calls from ""customers"" wanting to lower their monthly bill.  
I don't fault people for wanting to do this at all, I realize the world is crazy and expensive and cutting corners where you can can often be helpful.

What happens on Rocket Money's side is out of my realm of knowledge. I only know what happens when they call in, pretending to be you.

So here's a little script for you. I will be the A role, while the person pretending to be you will be the B role.

A: Thank you for calling the company I work at, can I please have your name to get started?  
B: Yes my name is Frank Peters.  
A: Thank you very much, as an added level of security, I'm going to send the number you called in on a secondary PIN in a text, please read that back to me when you get it.  
B: Oh, I, uh, you can't because I'm driving.  
*(Spoiler: I can hear a call center in the back ground between the person muting their mic and unmuting it)*  
A: Oh, well we certainly don't want you to break any hands free laws, would you mind pulling over at your next safe opportunity so that we can continue?  
B: You can access my account with just my PIN.  
A: Unfortunately as added security we are now required to send a one time PIN, so without it I would only be able to provide you with generic information. What is your question today?  
B: (Hangs up.)

That's if we can't get into the account. Before the change they would get your PIN that you give them, along with your information, and they would call in and number spoof and claim to be you to access your account. Trust me, when they do this, they have the ability to do whatever they want. Cancel services, suspend services, order THOUSANDS of dollars worth of things, that you are now liable and responsible for.

***Fun Fact: Under the Truth in Caller ID Act, FCC rules prohibit anyone from transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud, cause harm or wrongly obtain anything of value. Anyone who is illegally spoofing can face penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation.***

So lets say the person gets through, here's a new script, same roles as above.

A: Now that we have accessed your account, what can I do for you today?  
B: I am facing (insert random financial struggle reason here) and I am looking for a way to reduce my monthly bill, but I don't want to make any changes to the account.  
A: Well hey I can understand wanting a bill that's less expensive, but without making changes to the account I have no way of lowering your monthly bill. We could look at reducing or removing X, Y, or Z.  
B: No, no, I don't want to make any changes. If you can't do it then how about a credit?  
A: A credit for what exactly?  
B: For my bill, because I'm going through (random financial struggle) and I need a break.  
A: I can get needing a break, looking over the account I don't see a reason why you would need a credit, your billing is correct, there's no issues with the services you're getting, and there's been no other errors. We can set you up with a promise to pay and extend your due date if you need more time to pay your bill.  
B: No, just a credit, thank you. If you can't do it then maybe you can talk to your manager.

I won't keep going, but you get the idea. Rocket Money is calling on your behalf to lower your bill, because apparently you either can't do it yourself, or you trust this company with complete and unfiltered access to your account to try to get it done for you.

Rocket Money is a waste of time and money. They charge a subscription to their service to manage your subscriptions to other services. Tell me how that makes sense. All that money you're ""saving"" goes to right back to them.

This is DIRECTLY from their website:

# Bill Negotiation Service: We offer a Bill Negotiation service. Our specialists will negotiate with service providers like internet and phone companies to lower your bills. If the negotiation is successful, we'll charge a fee of 35% - 60% of your first year's savings. You choose the percentage within this range!

Lets say they save you, somehow, $500 off of your yearly internet bill. They are then going to turn around and charge you a fee of $175-$300 when you could have just called yourself and saved yourself the full $500 if you're able to manage it.

This isn't saving you money. This is wasting it and giving people the opportunity to hack into your account and take it over. If the wrong people get your account verification information, they can destroy your account, sometimes to the point it can't be recovered.

Don't let this happen to you. Don't fall for their ridiculous scams. Thanks.",2396,0.9,2396,0,2696.0,299.0,116,1743138054.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jlni4u/stop_using_rocket_money_please/,False,True

Since the transaction was not from the same bank my aunt uses, they weren’t able to reverse it and they only see it as “unknown”. That to me is a big red flag that it is a scam. They also instructed her to work with law enforcement if they continue to harass her via calls. 

I instructed her to send a quick text along the line of “I have alerted my bank of this transfer. They said you should call your bank to reverse the charge since they have the authority to do so. Please do not contact me moving forward or I will get law enforcement involved.”

Hopefully I gave her good advice with us escalating the issue to the police if they do continue to harass. I’m more so paranoid they would show up to our house and worried about everyone safety. But all signs (and all of my research) are giving huge red flags that it’s a scam.

1nwloxa,personalfinance,Citibank denied my credit card fraud claim of $1400. Now what?,"Last month while on vacation,  a charge showed up on our Citibank credit card that we didn't recognize. It was for a boat cruise that neither my wife or I ever purchased. I reported it online immediately, Citi called and asked us some questions, and they cancelled our card. The next day I got a text message notification of a large pending purchase for airline tickets.  That was obviously denied since the card had been cancelled.

Just today the I got a letter from Citi saying they resolved the dispute and said it was our responsibility as the purchase was made with the chip of the card and, since I said the cards were in our possession, we were responsible. I'm dumbfounded.

I've dug into this further, and the day and time the boat tour was purchased coincides almost exactly (within a minute or two) of the end of a cab ride we had taken. There's also no cab ride showing on our CC statement. It's now fairly clear the cab driver charged us for a $1400 boat tour and not a cab ride. Since you don't sign for anything, or even swipe your own card, in these cabs there was no way to know we were being fraudulently charged.

Do any industry experts out there have any advice?  I really don't want to pay $1400 for something I did not knowingly purchase.

UPDATE #1: I just looked back at the notification about the airline ticket purchase that was denied Turns out that was an old message. I saw it when Citi sent a dispute update and assumed that they were two new texts - I didn't see the old date. So, it turns out there was no fraudulent airline charge related to this, it's just the cab ride that somehow got registered as a $1409.88 boat cruise.

UPDATE #2: I scoured my cc statement and this was definitely a mischarge by the cab driver. I don't' know why the charge came up as a boat cruise. Either the cab company also runs a boat cruise company and this was an honest mistake, or the guy was crooked. Interestingly, the cab fare would have been about 12 Euros. The boat cruise charge is for 1,200.00 Euros. Perhaps he just hit zero too many times.? I'm going to read through all these responses any try with Citi again tomorrow. I'll keep folks posted. Thanks for all the advice, and wish me luck!

UPDATE #3: The saga continues nearly 2 months later.... Sorry in advance this is a bit lengthy, but this is nuts.

 After finding out the charge was made with the chip of the card I called Citi and had the case moved from a fraud dispute to a billing dispute. It actually took two separate calls to get that switch made, but eventually they sent me paperwork to provide additional details. I completed the form and returned them to the supplied email address ahead of their submission deadline. Separately, I also filed a complaint with the CFPB. That complaint was simply forwarded to Citi's team - seemingly without any effort to help resolve the matter. 

Today I was notified again the dispute was declined with the reason basically being not enough supporting information. The letter said I should take the charge up with the merchant. I promptly called, went back and forth, and eventually escalated the call to a supervisor. 

After explaining all this again and was told I was probably out of luck because I improperly disputed the entire amount of the charge rather than disputing this as an overcharge. Because Citi had already gone to the merchant once, the couldn't go back legally. I pointed out my paperwork indicated otherwise - I clearly checked the ""overcharge"" option and provided additional information. Based on what I was told I sense they mishandled the investigation.

I asked for substantiating documentation from the vendor that must have been pulled during their investigation. He claimed it was in the resolution letter. I knew it wasn't, so I asked him to read back the response. He couldn't. As I pressed for clarity, he told me he didn’t want to play “brain games.” He eventually offered to reopen the investigation under the overcharge category but that I had to resubmit all the same information all over again. My sense is that he was just trying to get me off the phone. I asked why this investigation would be different outcome, especially given that he told me they couldn't go back to the merchant. He gave a dodgy non-answer. 

I emphasized that if I’m being held responsible for a nearly €1,200 overcharge, I expect to see substantiating documentation from Citi’s investigation. 

I said because I have little faith that Citi will resolve this to my satisfaction I asked for the contact information from the merchant so I could follow-up directly. He said he didn't have that information. I asked for at least the business name. He said he didn't have that either. I asked him ""So I have a charge, made with a chip, for a cab ride that shows up as a boat cruise. There's no boat cruise company that goes by that name. You're telling me that Citi botched the investigation and it's on me to contact the merchant, but you can't provide any information to help me out?"". His suggestion, and I'm not even making this up, was to call local hotels and ask if they know of a company by that name. I asked him if that was a serious suggestion. He changed the topic.

Seriously, if I didn't know any better I'd say I was on some hidden camera show. This is crazy. 

Suffice to say, we are no longer using this card and I'm contemplating my next steps.

1j9yusa,personalfinance,Won chargeback and now merchant threatening to send me to collections,"I bought a 4k sectional couch online that was advertised as top grain italian leather.  It arrived in beat up boxes with Chinese markings and Chinese tags (looked like it had been dropshipped from China).  The white couch had multiple black stains, scratched up legs and one of the sectional motors did not work.  The material also seemed like cheap, fake leather not the Italian top grain that was advertised.

I contacted the merchant and told them I wanted to return the couch.  The merchant said 
1) Original shipping was non-refundable 
2) They would not pay for or arrange return shipping - I had to pay for the return shipping 
3) Upon receiving the return it would be inspected for damage (that might occur during return shipping)which they would subtract from any refund amount.

I said it was unacceptable to make me pay original and return shipping for a damaged item.  After they still refused to provide a return shipping label I filed a chargeback on my Visa Wells Fargo card and submitted documentation and pictures.  Visa ruled in my favor for the chargeback.

I am now receiving threatening messages from the company saying they will send me to collections and take legal action as I have unjustly enriched myself.  Do I need to do anything at this point to protect my credit score?

1ls9s6x,personalfinance,"Had $13,000 left on car loan, Capital One offered for us to get out of it for $7000. Confused as to why?","Context is my mom passed last July, and we gave her car to my sister. We were paying $500 a month with an 8% interest rate, but then, for some reason, the interest rate dropped to 0%. We didn't question it and just continued to pay. Now we want to move the title to her name, but can't get the title unless the car is paid off, so we called Capital One to see what our options were, and they offered for us to get out from under the loan for $7000. Why? Is it because of the 0% interest? Is it out the kindness of their hearts? 

The reason I ask is that my sister would probably need to take out a loan for the 7k. But that loan would have interest. Her credit is fine, not great. But it'd be great if that monthly payment of $500 could go down to something like $250 for her. Should we just shop around for another loan? Any suggestions on where to look?

My mom texted me while they were there, so I sent over the information the sales associate requested, including a picture of my driver’s license. I specifically asked to be called before anything was signed in Finance so I could make sure they weren’t being taken advantage of.

But they didn’t call me until after the dealership had already given my parents the car. I told the sales associate, ""You were supposed to call me."" He replied that they still needed to go over the documents with me, but I said I needed to speak with my parents first and hung up.

The deal is terrible. With all the add-ons the dealer included, a $23,000 car ballooned to over $33,000, and the loan term is way too long. I refuse to sign—it goes completely against what I agreed to, and it exposes me to too much financial risk.

I bought a new EV. I was trying to sell my ICE (16 Accord). The 1st dealer from whom I wanted to buy the EV offered 8k. I asked them to check the car while I test drove.
 
I had already googled the basic value of my car, and I knew it should be in the range of 10 to 12k. I told the dealer that's too low and I will take 10k with the incentive deal they had (1k discount for trading in). He said no.
 
I went to CarMax, they gave me a 10k estimate. Same for Edmund and Carvana.

Dealer one (Ford) just looked at the car, didn't even check under the hood, or test drive it. Gave a 12k verbal offer. I asked for a written offer, and he said we don't do that. I knew it was BS, so I just said OK and moved on.
 
Dealer two (Honda) gave me an 8k offer. I told him KBB has it at 12k, I have other offers at 11k from a dealer across from them (fake it till you make it). 15 mins later, he gave me a revised offer at 11k.
 
Dealer three (Hyundai) wouldn't check my car until I was willing to actually sell my car. I told him I can't sell it now as I have to 1st buy a car, otherwise I won't have a car to go to work. They said, buy the CSR and come back.
 
Dealer four (Jaguar) is the best dealership I have ever gone to. No wait time. The lady came by and asked me to sit at her desk. Took my keys, had someone test drive it, and check the car. 30 mins later, gave me a written offer of 11.1k, good for 7 days. Didn't upsell me or anything.

How do people even DO this while keeping up with life??

I've had a wedding, had a baby, I am saving significantly for a downpayment in a HYSA.

Anyway, laying awake at night at 3am I decided would be a good time to panic.

It was more important to me to not accumulate debt when in the peak years of many expenses.  I mean how do people even max out???  I am sooo financially illiterate and feel like an idiot,  is it too late to fix this?  What should I do going forward?

I have two 401K's --
One now has 186k
One has 32k

Obviously both have gone down lately.

$131k annual income.  Currently contributing just 7% (not including the 6% company match)

1m983vj,personalfinance,"Got a recycled phone number, ended up fighting off five years of nonstop debt collector harassment for someone I’ve never met","Back in 2014, I moved back to the U.S. after a military assignment overseas. One of the first things I did was get a new cell phone number in the city I was planning to settle down in.

Almost immediately, I started getting calls and texts from debt collectors, always for a woman I had never heard of. I don’t remember the name now, but the calls were relentless. At first it was polite messages asking her to call back. I would tell them, “I just got this number. I don’t know who that is.” But the calls didn’t stop. They intensified. Over the next few years, I started getting messages saying it was my “final opportunity to settle before a lawsuit.”

Then, in 2019, five years into this, I get a call from a very professional-sounding young woman who says she’s a paralegal calling on behalf of a law firm to collect on a recent legal judgment. I asked for her full name and the law firm, repeated it back, and wrote it all down. Then I calmly said:

“Listen very carefully to what I’m about to say. I know you’ll understand it because you’re professionally trained and you work at a law firm. I am not the person you are looking for. I got this phone number in 2014 after returning from five years of military service overseas. If you don’t believe me, call the cell phone provider, they can verify when it was issued to me.
I have told every single person who’s ever called that you have the wrong number. If I ever hear from you or anyone about this again, I will sue your law firm for harassment. Do you understand me?”

She paused, then very politely apologized and assured me I’d never hear from them again.

And just like that, it ended. I haven’t gotten another call about her since.

My takeaway from this whole mess is there is no such thing as honest communication with debt collectors. I assume people lie to them all the time, and as a result they just treat everyone like they’re lying too. They don’t care about reason, or truth, or even basic decency. It felt like such a joyless, broken system.
I genuinely feel bad for anyone who works in that industry. And even worse for the people on the other end of it.

Let me know if anyone else has dealt with recycled number nightmares. Or if there’s a better way to stop these calls before they drag on for five years like mine did.",1965,0.95,1965,0,2074.0,109.0,391,1753470818.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m983vj/got_a_recycled_phone_number_ended_up_fighting_off/,False,True
1kcfamp,personalfinance,Chase closed all four of my accounts,"I’m 22 years old and Chase just closed all 4 of my credit cards, my personal checking account (which had about $5,000), and my business account (which had around $75,000). I called in and asked to speak with a supervisor, and was told the reason was “unusual activity.” The only thing I did recently was pay off about $20K in credit card debt.

I’ve never missed a payment, and I was just trying to clean up my finances. I wasn’t given any specific details beyond being “flagged,” and now I’m extremely worried about the impact this will have on my credit score — especially losing 4 accounts at my age.

Is there any way to get Chase to reconsider or reopen the accounts? Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Should I escalate this or file a complaint somewhere?

Any advice would be appreciated.

A lot of people are saying that I should open new checking accounts with another bank. What other bank would you guys recommend where I won’t have to face something like this again?

Another question**

Instead of having Chase issue me a check for my business account balance, can I just withdraw the full amount in cash? That way, when I open a new bank account, I can deposit the cash directly and avoid waiting 7–10 business days for a check to clear. 

I run a business, and managing cash flow is critical — my vendors give me 21-day terms, and if I don’t pay on time, they stop selling to me. That’s why I’d rather withdraw the full amount in cash instead of waiting 7–10 business days for a check to clear. But yeah, clearly trying to access my own money to keep my business running must mean I’m up to something shady lol.

UPDATE**
Looks like they closed all 4 of my credit cards and my personal checking but decided to leave my business account open.

He told me that the rent i have been paying him (i live with my parents) for last 5 years or so, hes actually been putting in this secret savings account, and then he was also matching the amount I put in.

I am going to have 3 life insurance payouts which will sit around $600k.


So my question is should I just pay off my mortgage, vehicle, and trailer loans and add the rest to a HYSA and max out contributions in the Roth and 529? 


Obviously I cant make all the payments with my one salary so I am trying to figure out the best way to maximize my money while not getting too crazy because I am alone in the finances now. 



Edit: Adding in details on camper and vehicle.


Camper is $12,600 balance at 8.24%


Vehicle 21k at 6.24%


Mortgage is 3.25%

The camper seems like the thing I should get rid of but we use it a lot for travel softball tournaments but also just going camping. My daughter and I have camped since she was 3 and maybe 25% of that time it was just the two of us so it is a thing we enjoy doing. My wife passed less than a month ago and we have since gone camping just to get away from everything. Financially I know its dumb but the insurance payout on it is 10k more than what I owe so it wass an extremely good deal when we bought it this year. 


Also thank you all so much for the condolences and well wishes. She was super loved and had about 500 people at her celebration of life so she will be deeply missed by so many.

1liiqtb,personalfinance,What do you do after your emergency fund is depleted?,"I was laid off in April. I had 3 months of savings, now depleted, and I won't be able to pay my mortgage next month. I have applied to over 400 jobs with a decent amount of interviews. What can I actually do? 

Editing to add relevant details: 

I am on unemployment. My unemployment will last 2-3 more months. One month of unemployment does not cover my mortgage. I am ineligible for any other public services, such as food stamps or Medicaid. I am uninsured. My unemployment is roughly 20% of my prior salary.

I have done all the things I should have done after being laid off - filed for unemployment, contacted my banks and credit card companies, cancelled all subscriptions and memberships, even refilled my expensive prescriptions before my insurance ended. Did you know that one inhaler - one month of use - is $600 without insurance? 

I have already contacted my mortgage company, but they cannot do anything until I miss a payment. Then, I can apply for hardship, but it is unclear whether that would be a full deference or a few hundred dollars off the mortgage. I would not know until I start the process. 

I wish I could have saved more than a 3-month emergency fund, but this is my third layoff in three years. I'm lucky that I was able to save up just 3 months worth of money. The first time I was unemployed, I took out a personal loan. The second time, I cashed out my 401k. I do not have much leverage with loans at this point. A HELOC is my absolute last resort. I have only owned my home for 3 years, so it will not be a substantial loan and I will have nothing once that is exhausted. 

I live in a HCOL area and I work in tech (hence the repeated lay-offs). I am applying to any and all relevant jobs in my field. I would like to get a job outside of tech, but that is not really up to me in this job market. I will accept the first offer I get. My interview stats are pretty solid for my field. Unless you have similar experience, there is no reason to comment on my job search. This is a personal finance subreddit - not a career judgement one.

While I would love to get a side job in the meantime, my unemployment will decrease with every dollar I earn. My unemployment cannot cover my bills, but it is more than I would earn from a part-time, minimum-wage job. This is not MY choice - it is just how it works. And yes, I can and do work for cash but that's not going to cut it. Please see this comment for a better explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1liiqtb/comment/mzcn3gy/

Some commentors are saying the math doesn't add up. I don't know what to tell you other than I had 3 months of money saved up, and the end of that 3 months will be July 1. I can scrape together all of the money for my other bills to pay my mortgage, obviously, but then I'll be defaulting on loans and credit cards - again. My credit is wrecked. And no, I can't ask family - they are abusive - I haven't spoken to them since I turned 18.

I am looking for answers other than the obvious 'get a part-time job' and 'file for unemployment.' I am steps ahead of that. I am hoping someone has some niche or other idea that might work for me.

And I don’t understand what this product was supposed to do in the first place. Pacific Life is not a small, shady insurance company. That’s what is baffling to me.

It appears to be that he just wanted a deferred joint lifetime annuity. That’s a very simple insurance product. It should have been very straightforward.

But I think he was led astray by some convoluted tax avoidance structuring that in reality avoided taxes by failing to generate any gains.

I did decide to take a bit more out of savings to put down to pass the PMI off and drop our payment down. We will be closing now sometime in the next week or so due to this paperwork change. Thanks everyone so much for their insight!

What is bad debt and am I in trouble?","Last year I went on holiday to America and I had a skiing accident and ended up in hospital (torn ACL, the classic). I had insurance when I went over for winter sports, so my insurance company could cover the medical fees. HOWEVER, this dumb ass hospital I was treated at (they completely misdiagnosed me) will not stop harassing my family friends in america for my bill even though my insurance company said they have sent a stamp of payment to them numerous times. The hospital has been asking me to pay them directly (which is not how UK insurance companies work) to then get reimbursed by my insurance - which won’t work with the contract i signed. This was so long ago now that I emailed the hospital today and they have told me it will be going into bad debt?!?! WTF DOES THIS MEAN? Am I now never going to be let back to america because of this?

EDIT: This blew up way more than I expected and I really appreciate everyone’s help thank you!!!!!  

UPDATE! (if this sounds bizarre this is just how UK insurance companies often work overseas). My insurance company sent a confirmation/ validation of payment to the hospital the day after my visit to them. The hospital never put two and two together and essentially lost the document, therefore didn’t have the correct billing information and hence why they have been harassing myself and my family friends.

1iglypv,personalfinance,Vanguard silently lowers the expense ratio on 53 ETFs,"**The average expense ratio reduction is 23%.**

The official Vanguard news and announcements URL - [https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/index.html](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/index.html) \- has made no mention of these changes at the time of writing this post.

Vanguard has reduced the expense ratios (the annual fees you pay) on many of their most popular ETFs. For example, their [Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus) now costs just 0.05% per year – down from 0.08%. That’s a 37.5% reduction.

Investors benefit from reduced fees because every dollar saved in fees is a dollar that stays invested and can grow over time. While fees aren’t the only factor to consider when choosing investments, they’re one of the few aspects of investing that you can control. Lower fees mean more of your money stays invested for your future.

You don’t need to take any action to benefit from these lower fees if you already own affected Vanguard ETFs (list below). The reduced expenses will automatically apply to your investments.

1lb9pah,personalfinance,Giving my kids money in their young adult years instead of leaving an inheritance,"I recently read Simple Path to Wealth, Common Sense Investing, If You Can, and Die with Zero. I liked Die with Zero but only recommend it as a balance to the books the heavily emphasis saving and investing.

  
This got me reflecting on my grandparents. They essentially gave me my inheritance from 18-30. I received between $5000-15,000/year during that period and I'd estimate it at little over $100k in total. I  took hard course loads in college and worked throughout but they gave me enough money that I didn't have to take out student loans, I had money to buy an engagement ring, and money for a downpayment on first house (though it was 2008 and the house cost $125k). 

When my grandma died last year, there wasn't much left in her estate. My grandparents gave in a perfect way where there was no strings attached. They grew up in the depression and worked blue collar jobs but lived modestly and saved. At 40, a home owner with a good career and a happy marriage I can't help but feel gratitude and wonder where I would be if they hadn't done that. 

I like using the 4% rule for estimating how much to save for financial independence goals but those models all assume you're going to end with a chunk of money at the end. I'm beginning to shift my thoughts of ending with just enough to cover my retirement home expenses till 95 and trying to give more to my kids in the 18-30 year range. They're 12-16 right now. 

Curious how others think about this. What assumptions do you use for withdrawal rates or savings if you plan on giving out ""inheritances"" when you're still living?

1j3gd9u,personalfinance,What I learned after tracking expenses for 2+ years,"Hey everyone! I've been tracking my expenses for the past 2 years, increased my savings 8 times, and I wanted to share some unexpected insights that might help others.

**1. Inflation is way more personal than headlines suggest**

I always read about inflation rates, but never noticed it in “real life”. After about a year of tracking expenses, I discovered this. It’s hard to track based on weeks or even months, and I really faced that after \~1 year. With the same expenses, the same quality of life level without any significant changes, I can’t fit my budget anymore. This realization was pretty disappointing. I was even thinking about stopping any budgeting and tracking activities. But that’s not the way, after a few days I returned to my normal state and decided to focus on increasing my income instead of abandoning my tracking habits.  
(my old tracking sheet after budget adjusting: [https://imgur.com/oweKCyc](https://imgur.com/oweKCyc))

**2. ""Normal months"" are rare - and that's normal**

One of my biggest revelations was that there's no such thing as a ""typical month."" Looking at my data:

* Some months were 30% over budget due to unexpected car repairs
* Other months were surprisingly under budget.
* Holidays and birthdays always threw things off.
* Medical expenses came out of nowhere.

The key learning: Build a buffer for these ""surprise"" months. They're actually not surprises - they're part of life. “Emergency fund” is a must-have, but it’s not a magic pill, don’t rely on it too much.  
(my February nightmare, s\*\*t happens, just keep going: [https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix](https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix))

**3. Impulse buying becomes harder when you track**

This was unexpected, but knowing I'd have to log purchases made me think twice about random buys. I simply don’t want to see those red numbers in my green budget life. Of course, it doesn’t save you millions (actually depends on your income/expenses, but not my case). It is more about preventing spending more.

**4. Finally understand where my money ACTUALLY goes**

Before tracking, I had this vague idea about my spending. Now I know:

* My ""cheap"" coffee habit was actually $180/month. (Dropped it to \~50 after a year)
* Subscriptions were eating $85/month (that’s a hard thing to deal with, but at least it doesn’t grow for now)
* I was spending way more on food delivery than I thought.
* Weekend activities were 2x more expensive than I estimated. I do not have children, it is just me, my partner, and a dog. I can not imagine the children’s impact on that.

**5. Adjust**

Adjust, adjust everything, and find your comfort zone. Do not set hard limits without knowing your actual spending. First several months **must be** “testing” months. You should get to know your habits, your money, your expenses. Do not set unrealistic limits. You will be disappointed when you go over that number. Instead, be curious about your spending, investigate them. Just live an everyday life. But set in advance the duration of the period. 2-3 months worked well for me, I think that period is crucial not to drop all that expense-budgeting things.

**6. Peace of mind?**

I do not think you can achieve real peace of mind with all that. However, you can gain control over your finances. I have never considered the connection between my psychological state and budgeting. Those two years were tough for me, and my expense-tracking habit was a small part of my stability. But it depends on your personality.

**Conclusion**

Tracking expenses is truly impactful, and it has really changed my life. Those 2 years were not my first try. I have tried several times before, but all of them have been unsuccessful. Maybe I was too young (I’m 27 now), or there were other reasons for that. I’ve been working full time since I was 20, and for the first 5 years, I had less than 8k in savings. Now, after 2 years it is 8 times more. I can't attribute everything to budgeting and tracking expenses, but it helped 100%. Most of my money is in stocks and ETFs, so I do not have any short-term plans for them.

**Tips for anyone starting:**

* Start simple - just track everything for a month.
* Don't judge yourself in the beginning.
* Focus on patterns, not individual purchases.
* Be consistent with categories.
* Do not automatically import transactions from the bank, enter them manually.
* Use tools that don't feel like work.

**What's next?**

I will continue to track my spending. And I have a few more ideas about budget optimization and hacks to save money. I will test them this year and hopefully I will be able to increase my savings even more without any downgrades.

1i8bse8,personalfinance,I filed my taxes on 4 different popular websites and here are the results.,"For reference I have an office job with a W-2 and made about $80k a year (gross) and my husband is self-employed and made about $60,000 (gross) and receives a 1099-K. We made $6,000 in estimated tax payments (on top of my tax withheld) for 2024, have a child and bought a home in 2024 that we also use as a home office.

We usually always file jointly with TurboTax but figured we would try to see if the competitors were any better this year. Took a few hours but was worth it. For some reason TurboTax does not calculate as much of an expense for my husbands vehicle and home office as the other competitors which are the reasons for the refund differences (although we used exactly the same information for all). I think it could be the way TurboTax calculates what percent of the home/vehicle is being used for the business.

All that being said we will be filing with TaxFreeUSA this year.

EDIT: So I think I’ve figured out why I’m seeing some differences. It looks like for our home office that we are deducting from my husband’s income, TurboTax isn’t including our mortgage insurance premiums in the summation of expenses for the home office, while the other three are. Is that supposed to be included or not? Another difference was I forgot to add in the car taxes and interest for his car’s deduction. This gets us at exactly the same numbers as the other three which I’ve also gone through and updated.

I also went through with a fine tooth comb and was able to get all 4 websites to tie (if I force added the mortgage insurance to TurboTax. I can remove this from FreeTaxUSA before I file if it shouldn’t be included). Thank you to all who recommended that I review everything. I learned a lot and ended up discovering more cases where I was eligible to deduct more from my husband’s income so I could pay even less in taxes! (HOA fees, pest control, etc for our house since it benefited the home office as well!) 

I hope I helped at least one other person and a good lesson to me to be more careful especially when pregnant and overtired!

1i6lqlv,personalfinance,Father in law is dying and spent all of the family’s money,"Edit: mortgage was way off. Apologies! It’s $2,950/mo plus $456/mo home equity loan. This changes things drastically. Probably have to sell the house. Thank you for everyone who helped. I should’ve confirmed the number before I posted this. Apparently that $800 came from my father in law 

My father in law is 73, has glioblastoma (diagnosed oct 2024) and we just found out that he has not been being honest about finances nor has he been being paid for over a year at his job. The business was in trouble and he was making half salary for 2 years and apparently now zero salary this past year (with the promise that he will get this money back after a deal closed). Now he is unable to work and his employer is saying he can’t pay him what he is owed. 

My mother in law spends a lot (in her defense she didn’t know the financial situation was dire) and I assume my father in law wanted to keep her happy and let her buy whatever she wants, thinking he will get this deal closed and be back to having money.  His boss owes him approx 700k. Since this plan has all gone to shit, he has been draining their retirement and any other money they had without anyone knowing. So now, he is incapacitated and they are f’d. 

Their house is probably worth about 700k. I believe they have ~250k to be paid off on the mortgage (have refinanced and probably took home equity loan at some pt) My question is basically, what order do we pay bills. I would think definitely sell the house, but the mortgage is about $800 and rent would be 4 times that. I should also mention they have their adult son living with them who contributes nothing and has bad credit and his own debt, but they won’t just let him be homeless. 

So, sorry to ramble I’m just trying to figure this out. If you don’t pay your mortgage, how fast do they take the house from you? If you don’t pay your electric suddenly, how fast do they turn it off? What can we get away with not paying for a little while until we get things under control? He has life insurance but we have to find out if it’s term or whole. 

My mother in law has a lot of jewelry, handbags, fancy china. Would an estate sale be beneficial?

Your suggestions have given me a lot to think about. I think my sister and I need to sit down with an estate attorney and really go over all of these options thoroughly. I really can’t thank you all enough for spending time here with me tonight to help me and my family. You all seem like very wonderful people and I’m grateful for all of you. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your evening.

Original Post:

My mom worked for herself for years with a home daycare, so she didn’t put much into Social Security apparently. I don’t exactly know how that works to be honest. But she gets about $600 a month and that’s it.

She has Medicare, and no supplemental insurance and no drug coverage.

She divorced my dad when I was about three years old and he took off and disappeared. I found him about 15 years ago and then he passed away. I am in my early 50s.

My sister and I were the recipients of a little bit of money after my dad died because he was in a lawsuit that he ended up winning. We got my mom a used car and each contributed $7000 to that, and gave her and my grandmother each a check for $14,000 because they took care of us without any financial support from our father and that was the least we could do. This was about 10 years ago. 

My grandmother was living then, and she had her late husband‘s military retirement and her own Social Security, so between the three incomes, and my sister giving my mom $500 a month and me giving my grandmother $500 a month they were doing OK.

Grandmom sadly passed away at the age of 103 at the end of 2022. Beyond the grief, that left my mother with $600 a month of Social Security and $1000 from her two daughters put together to live on every month. 

I encouraged her to apply for Medicaid. Because of the money in her savings account she does not qualify. The house is paid for as my grandmother paid cash for it back in 1971 when it was a new build. 

My mother cannot work. She is not in the best health. She also does not go to the doctor but that’s a whole different subject.

I am currently not in a situation where I can continue to pay her $500 every single month. But she needs it. She currently doesn’t have insurance on the house as there is no one in Florida writing for it right now in the condition that it’s in. GrandMom‘s home insurance of course dropped coverage when she passed away and the house was built in 1971 and will need work to be up to code in a couple of areas to pass the four-point inspection. We already paid for a new roof, but it has the old wiring that I don’t know if the plumbing would pass inspection.

My understanding is that if my mother was to qualify for SSI and Medicaid she would have to first spend all of her savings down. My understanding is that the house would not count against her as an asset as she is living there and it’s already paid for.

I have no idea what to do. My sister and I are really struggling right now to continue with the money that we promised to pay her to help support her. She is not living extravagantly at all. She has canceled every subscription including Amazon prime. She has no cable television or streaming services, no newspaper no magazines nothing like that. She has one cell phone no landline. She never runs the central heat or air she uses a window unit in her room for AC in the summer and a Space heater in her room in the winter. 

She pays for car insurance registration and gas and repairs, electricity, cell phone, Internet service (very basic slow cheapest one they had), groceries, water sewer trash. As I said before she doesn’t go to the doctor so she doesn’t have medical expenses. She or a neighbor takes care of the yard.

It worries me that the house has no insurance but I cannot afford to get the whole thing rewired and I cannot afford to get new plumbing. 

I guess the TLDR is that she can’t work, she’s not in great health, my sister and I are stretched to the limit in giving her $500 a month each and getting a new roof recently for the house, (it was literally leaking and there was black mold at about 15 or 18 years old I think, so there was no choice), she currently does not qualify for SSI or Medicaid because of the $14,000 given to her that has grown a little bit in her Discover savings account.

If anyone has any suggestions at all I am all ears. I think she’s gonna end up having to move in with one of us actually, but without sharing too much, that would be the very last resort as she was a very abusive parent and we are caring for her because we are being daughters. Living with her would be a nightmare but if that has to happen it has to happen.

PS this is in Florida and we all live within about 20 minutes of each other. My sister and I both work full-time. We physically visit once a week and help out with any chores or items needing fixing that we can help with.

I’m hesitant to even hit post here because I really don’t think there’s an answer but maybe someone here will have some ideas?

Based in San Francisco.  Was just laid off from my job at a software company after 13 years there.  Am not hopeful for being immediately hired in tech again soon, if ever.  So Im assuming worst case scenario that Im not working a well paid job or perhaps any job anytime soon (Im talking years). Here is my current financial picture:

401K accounts (Fidelity and Vanguard):  $950,000, with about 50% in VWENX (balanced 60/40 US stock/bonds), 40% in FXAIX ETF (tracks S&amp;P 500), 10% in FBALX (balanced 60/40 US stocks/bonds).

Brokerage Account:  $1.25 million, with about 70% in VTI, 10% in VGT, 10% in  VOO + VOOG, and varying amounts in XYZ (Block), NVDA, IBIT.  $50,000 in BND (Vanguard total Bond ETF).

Cash:  $450,000 (a chunk of this is meant for emergency fund, and home maintenance (new roof, at the very least)).

Home Mortgage remaining:  $640,000, 2.5% interest.  
Home Value:  $1.6 million, according to Zillow. At the peak in 2022, Zillow estimated it to be $2.1 million.

Total annual expenses:  $70,000 (this includes mortgage, property taxes, insurance, utilities, food, etc). Im frugal.

I want to downsize and sell the house, and will pay CASH for a condo with a target of $900,000.  But will likely hold out for a few years for, HOPEFULLY, improvement in the housing market.

Oh, and I have had a side gig for the past 20+ years that has reliably brought in about $25K-30K/year (pre-tax).

No other liabilities. Single. Child independent and working.  No intention of ever leaving SF.... unless im desperate and really running out of money.

Oh yeah, and I have $330,000 in previous tax losses that I can harvest ahead, due to some significant losses in individual stocks (now I stay away from individual stocks and stick with ETFs).

My BIG question is..... what do I do with that $450,000 in cash?  I have a real fear of not finding another well paid job at a tech company again b/c of my age (and alot of the assets Ive accumulated was due to the success of my last company's IPO).  Ive worked in tech for a while, but in pre-sales (not engineering/product).  Once I downsize and sell the house to pay cash for a condo, I will be relieved of a mortgage and my annual expenses will be much lower.  But what's the best way to put my cash to work now, while optimizing returns and minimizing risk, since Im not working now and may not be for a while????

Fidelity said they were never told by the DTC as Blackrock never notified them. According to Blackrock they will allow me to sell once per quarter 5-20% of my shares.

The dividends will still pay out possibly higher it just will no longer trade on any exchange.

1hx120x,personalfinance,Useful tips from a person who lost their home in a fire,"Useful tips from a person who lived through a house fire.

Five years ago our home burned down. This is my advice and tips on what happens next. I’m here to answer any questions.

Typically your insurance policy will have three main categories: Relocation coverage, content coverage and structural coverage.

Check your insurance policy for how much relocation coverage you have. Chances are you could have anywhere from 25k to unlimited coverage (most policies have a max, I changed ours to unlimited after our fire). This is extremely important because you will need to pay your mortgage while paying to live somewhere else while you rebuild.  If you have a max amount for coverage, you will need to factor that into your budget when finding a new place to live. If your policy is older, this may be an issue since rental rates increase at lightening speeds in CA.

If you live in an HOA, your policy will likely cover your HOA dues until you are able to move back. YOU have to read your policy, the insurance company won’t point it out. You have to find every benefit you are entitled to yourself.

Get a PO BOX immediately or hold your mail for pick up. We had perfect credit and missed a payment on our Home Depot card due to not having a mailbox and we are still taking the hit even after explaining it to Home Depot.

Your adjuster can be your best friend or worst enemy. Make sure they cut you a check within 48 hours for the necessities you need to purchase (clothing, etc). SAVE EVERY RECEIPT!!!!!

BE VERY SKEPTICAL of “mold remediation” companies or restoration companies. They can be predatory. They get the fire reports, know who you are and if you have insurance. The day after our fire, one of the biggest companies contacted us and said our insurance sent them (they lied). They prey on your emotional state and make false claims that they can “restore” anything you may have left. THIS USES A BIG PART OF YOUR CONTENT COVERAGE! They literally charged us $5 for each pair of socks they washed, $500 to wash a comforter, etc. SPOILER…..they cannot get the smell out so unless it’s something you really cherish, it’s not worth it. They will use your entire policy coverage if you let them. If you have something you think you can save, find a good dry cleaner on your own. Trust me!

We maxed out every part of our policy after rebuilding. Make sure you call your mortgage company because their name will be included on the insurance checks (as you rebuild, not for relocation or your contents).",1405,0.97,1405,0,1450.0,45.0,105,1736386258.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1hx120x/useful_tips_from_a_person_who_lost_their_home_in/,False,True

1jle14z,personalfinance,My grandparents have a reverse mortgage and they don’t understand. Neither do I.,"My grandparents purchased a brand new home in 2010. They paid for it in cash with the funds they’d made from the sale of the home they owned prior to this purchase. 

Fast forward a couple years after they purchased and they fell on hard times. Because of this, and without any discussion with anyone else, they took out a reverse mortgage. 

They’ve been getting payments of (around) $1600 a month for 10 years now on top of their social security, etc. None of us family members knew they had done this until 2023 when they finally had to approach me, their grandkid, about helping them financially because they were robbing Peter to pay Paul. 

All that aside, they have a reverse mortgage. We stepped in and helped out financially and paid off their debts, etc. but I’m curious on the reverse mortgage stuff. Hoping someone here can help. 

I don’t know how long this reverse mortgage thing lasts. And more importantly, WHAT happens after the pot runs dry from said reverse mortgage. They’ve taken two loans out from said reverse mortgage since they took it out on top of receiving $1600/month payments. 

My grandparents are in their late 80’s. One now has dementia so getting answers to any of this is not doable. My grandfather took the reverse mortgage out and now he has dementia. So my grandmother is left with not understanding how this works. I once called the reverse mortgage company to get info with her on the line and was told they have 5 years left on the reverse mortgage. I didn’t ask what happens after that so hoping someone can explain to me here. This was in 2023. So now they’ve got three years left on this reverse mortgage. 

What happens then? 

Does anyone know? I’m heartbroken and they’re confused. Trying to help as much as I can. First step is to try and understand.

My mom needed to get some dental work done. She was given a quote by the office staff saying that she would have to pay $9000 and that the insurance would pay for the balance ($6000). The woman at the office also called the insurance and had confirmed this.

Now, the dentist’s office is calling and saying that the insurance is not paying for it and that she’s on the hook for the additional $6000. My mom can’t afford the additional financing (she financed the $9000 for two years at 0%). When my mom asked about the woman who gave her the original quote, the person on the phone said that the woman (conveniently) no longer works there.

We called the dental insurance and got the usual runaround from the representatives who gave vague answers, ranging from the coverage amount being used to the procedure not being fully covered. Typical insurance nonsense. They wouldn’t acknowledge the previous authorization they had given prior to my mom getting the dental work done.

I’m ready to go down to the dentist’s office and advocate for my mom, but I want to go with facts and evidence to present and valid argument.

What are the options here?

P.S. - Thanks for all of your help on this sub with the resources you have posted. You’ve helped me so much with getting on the right track when it comes to retirement.

Edit: She had the procedure done 4-5 months ago and financed the $9000 then. She has been actively paying toward that. They called her around 12/20 to tell her that the insurance was not paying anything and she was on the hook for the $6000.

1m0xvu2,personalfinance,Landlord offered to sell me the house I'm renting,"Landlord has offered to sell me the house I'm renting. It's a small 3 bed, 1 bath, with partial unfinished basement. Here are the terms: 

Owner financed (deed would be transferred to me)
$80,000
$0 down
4% interest for 15 years ($591.75 per month) 

Currently I'm only paying $500 to rent the house, I have been renting it for a while and have been planning on building on some family property (on a 10 acre lot with no houses around).

My main concern is that the house is on a small lot with an identical house right behind it, approximately 20 feet away. I told her the only way I would be interested is if I could buy them both, which she said she could do for the same terms. 

I can take some money I was going to build with to cover closing cost, tax, insurance, repairs, etc.  

The other house has someone moving in soon, there will be moved in before I could close, and they will only be paying $500 a month also. I know these numbers are laughably small in today's terms, but that's just how it is where I live. 

The houses have newer metal roofs, decent vinyl siding, but are otherwise very basic. I can do 99% of the maintenance myself. 

So is it worth it to buy them both, continue living in this house until I build and rent the other for less than I'll be paying per month, just to build equity? I currently have no debt, not married, no kids. Was planning on breaking ground this year but I could wait if this is the smarter route. 

Any and all advice welcomed. Thanks in advance. 

Edit: will definitely have it inspected by a licensed inspector. Also I could afford to pay for both of them, without a renter. Just wanted to see if it was a smart move financially.

Unfortunately, after testing was complete, our insurance denied the claim and told us we were responsible for the full billed amount. The testing company billed us in my son’s name, and they provided information for financial assistance if we fell below a certain income threshold. We met this threshold, but the application for assistance was very specific that it must be filled out by the listed responsible party and that the responsible party must be over 18 years old. 

Assuming there was a simple clerical error, we sent a letter to the testing company with a completed financial assistance application in my name. We also included a letter stating that they were attempting to bill a 9 year old and that I was the primary responsible party. We heard nothing and forgot about it. 

That was 3 months ago, and the debt has since been sold to a collection agency. I received a collections letter (again in my son’s name) for the full original billed amount. I immediately sent an email to the original testing company, recapping the events, noting their failure to respond to my letter or financial assistance application, and noting yet again that they had the wrong responsible party listed. I offered yet again to pay the reduced amount I am entitled to (according to my income) if they would recall the collection attempt and send an updated bill.

He was court ordered to provide me with insurance, but he recently switched me to one of the worst plans possible, so they only covered about $60 of it. Now he’s telling me to set up a payment plan with the hospital so I can pay it. I’ve asked him multiple times whether the bill is under my name or his, but he refuses to tell me and instead tries to guilt trip me into paying it. I honestly don’t care if I end up paying, but since he won’t give me any actual details I literally don’t even know where to pay it at. I don’t want to risk my credit getting completely screwed if it’s under my name.

Edit: the comments are getting a bit much to respond to individually but imma just make sure the debts not in my name and not tell him anything he got the bill so he knows what he has to pay and there’s no reason for me to tell him I’m filing myself under taxes since he legally shouldn’t be doing that anyways and he knows that

For my whole life, she said she wanted to leave her house to me, she was very open and adamant about that. However, her will was made before I was born, so the house legally went to my mom. My mom respects my grandmas wishes about the house, and I’m currently living in it. She also had a bank account with 600k in it with me and my mom as joint beneficiaries.

Hard lesson learned, making sure I’m not missing anything else","As the title pointed out, I got myself into a financial pickle of my own doing three years ago. For context, I also had a car repossession on my record, my credit score was around 560, and on a personal note I had broken up with my gf so all around, I was very desperate for a car and thought 18% was around what someone with my financial record deserved.

Three years later I’ve been blessed with a great career so I’ve saved up enough to pay off the remaining 12k balance, which sucks because the car in question (2016 Altima) is hardly worth 6-7k but that’s where the hard lesson is learned. In total, I’ll have paid almost $28k for that stupid thing.

I haven’t clicked the “Pay Now” button just yet but if by any minuscule chance there’s a better option than paying off that monstrosity now, I’d greatly appreciate it! So far the only disadvantage to paying off early is “lack of short term funds”, but I can live with that.

Edit: took out the word “scam” since as many people rightfully pointed out, I was not scammed given my high risk at the time.

I did check that I work multiple jobs in my w4. Outside of that, I have a kiddo but I only claim her every other year (her bio dad got it this year).

Is this normal/just what I should expect? Or what else could lead to such a high cost?

1lp7pew,personalfinance,My mom has nothing and needs assisted living ASAP,"I created a reddit just for this.... 

Both of my parents have been fiscally irresponsible for their entire lives. My father passed in 2013 and my mother is no longer able to take care of herself, she has severe memory problems and is a danger to herself, neither me or my siblings can be with her 24/7. I have tried a handful assisted living programs but I'm trying to figure out if there is any money at all to utilize. For background context; My father was drafted into the Vietnam war but served less than 90 days and is not eligible for programs like Patriot Angels that help vets and/or their widows find assisted living. She IS on Medicare and Medicaid but doesn't like any of the facilities that take the Medicaid assisted living waiver. She has no 401k or retirement benefit that I know of and I'm not sure if my father ever did either. She receives about $1100 a month from Social Security so we have basically nothing to work with. The questions I have about fixing this situation are; 

1. How would I go about researching if she OR my father have anything in a 401k or penchant or something similar that they may have forgotten about? 
2. Any programs that people would recommend or any Medicaid facilities that are not converted hotels with 2 staff members... (We live in New Mexico, ABQ area preferred)

1n5vkq2,personalfinance,"My parents are fine, right?","Parents are both in their mid-70s, dad is still working. I couldn't understand why he wouldn't retire, despite both him and my mom having significant health problems, and why they wouldn't hire help that they both obviously need, such as with housekeeping and yard work. I finally sat them down last night to talk about it and he told me that he's worried about money. But they have over a million in retirement savings that they haven't touched, plus Social Security, and their house is paid off and valued at about $400,000. They have no other debt. They don't lead an extravagant lifestyle. They've always been fairly frugal and lived within their means. We live in a low COL state. Dad told me he's worried about medical bills, but they have Medicare and a supplement and it sounds like the $5,000 deductible is the most they'd ever have to pay out of pocket. I could see one or both of them ending up in a nursing home due to their health issues, which is probably the biggest financial question mark in this situation.

Dad has refused to sit down with his financial planner to discuss all of this because the financial planner wanted him to calculate his monthly discretionary income, but he ""doesn't know how."" This man has worked in a job for decades that involves managing large organizational budgets, so I think this response is more one of overwhelm and anxiety than not actually knowing how. I did finally convince him to call the financial planner and have a discussion about this instead of continuing to avoid it, so that felt like a win.

I'd love to hear anyone else's take on this situation. I'm an only child with no other family nearby, so it's all on me to help them navigate this, and I don't exactly know what I'm doing.

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments, this has been very helpful! I want to add a little more context to answer some questions.

My main reason for wanting my dad to retire is that I don't think he's up to it physically or mentally anymore. He commutes an hour each way. He's started working from home some, but it's still too much for him. He had a triple bypass a couple years ago and hasn't been the same since, and he's now in the process of getting diagnosed with what we're pretty sure is Parkinson's. He is actually planning to retire at the end of this year, so this is less a matter of trying to convince him to retire and more a matter of trying to ease some of his anxiety about it. 

Some years ago he had a lawyer friend draw up his and my mom's wills, powers of attorney, and advance directives. All of these documents need to be updated for various reasons (for example, their PoAs name each other, not me) and all the copies they have are unsigned/un-notarized. This same lawyer friend advised them that they did not need a trust to protect their assets, and perhaps they don't; my grandmother died in a Medicaid nursing home and it was terrible. I would rather they spend their money to be somewhere slightly less miserable than set it all aside for me to inherit. That said, if there are more sensible ways to set all this up, we need to explore them. I will find us an estate planning attorney to discuss this.

I did offer to go with my dad to the financial planner and he was noncommittal, but I think I will call him tomorrow and reiterate that I want to go. He did seem open to my help, if very anxious about the situation. We have not had a very good relationship for most of my life, so it is a strange shift in dynamic for both of us.

No debt except the house. Decided to finance a truck at 1%. Home worth $800,000 with $400,000 equity. And then my wife had an affair and told me she wanted a divorce.


I decided to keep the house and the truck. I initially thought I was smart financing a truck at 1% with nothing down because I could put the $60,000 in a HYSA at 4% and ""make money"". I had no idea she'd leave and I'd end up with no cash and now the truck is only worth $40,000 with a $47k balance.


With the stupid high truck and mortgage payment, my income and outgo are the exact same. I may be able to get rid of a streaming service to save $15 per month, but what's the use at that point?


Here's where I get into a pickle. I have to remove her name from the mortgage within 2 years. I don't think I will be able to qualify for the loan with just my income. I need to find a way out of the truck, or a way to pay it off faster or I lose one or both.


I really really really don't want to sell the home. I built it myself and the children are rooted in the neighborhood.


I can't sell the truck because I have no money to get out from under water and even then, I have nothing else to drive so would have to take out another loan to get a car.


But what I CAN do is tread water for a long time. I have $10k cash and every month I look at my account and it is still $10k. Everything is in perfect balance. Is it so wrong to just continue to do this for a couple more years until the truck payment is gone?


Alternatively, I have medical receipts for $12,000 that I can claim to pull $12,000 from my HSA ($60,000 balance). I also have a Roth IRA at $100,000 that I have $60,000 contributions I can take out. So I have penalty and tax-free access to $72,000, but it's all in tax advantaged accounts. Do I touch any of it? Maybe leave it until right before I refinance to knock out the remainder of the truck to lower my D/I ratio?

1mwjyph,personalfinance,My Mom Needs a Cosigner for $18k Implants.,"I don’t know what to do. My mom never took care of her teeth and avoided the dentist for years, and now at 74 she’s losing the rest of her teeth from a severe infection. She’s lost so much gum and bone that dentures won’t stay in. My uncle, who she lives with, said he can’t cosign because he’s retired, so he asked me to. But I’m really worried.



The loan for implants is huge, and my mom’s health is fragile ... I’m not sure she’ll even make it through the 36 months it will take to repay. She would be using her Social Security, about $1,100 a month, to pay $500–$600 toward this loan.



At the same time, I need two implants myself that will cost around $4,000, and I was planning to finance them. I’m scared cosigning for her will hurt my ability to take care of my own dental needs. I feel guilty saying no, but if I say yes, I risk being stuck with a loan I can’t afford and undoing all the progress I’ve made paying off my credit cards and rebuilding my credit.

1j4ygp5,personalfinance,Walking away from Car deal at the last minute,"Hey Y'all

I have a question as if I was being unreasonable. Yesterday my wife and I were out looking to buy a car. We found one we liked and negotiated the out the door price we were comfortable at, 31550. We had been preapproved for a 5.5% interest rate from our credit union and were putting 20% down. I told the dealership if they could beat our rate we would finance with them. They came back with 5.39% from Bank of America. Now a key moment of this is my wife has never financed a car, and she had left her drivers license at home. So I ran home to get it after we agreed to an out the door price. 

Now here is where I blew up the deal. She was back at the finance department, and I came in and looked at the deal sheet. She has not financed a vehicle before, and I feel like they tried to take advantage of that. We are planning on financing for 3 years. According to my numbers from our credit union (financing 25k for 36 months at 5.5% interest) I was looking at a payment of 754.90. When I looked at the deal sheet, the financed amount was 25032 at 5.39% for 36 months. But somehow the payment was 797. I plugged those numbers into 3 different loan calculators and came back with a payment of 755 a month on all 3. I asked the finance guy what was added to raise our payment by 42 dollars a month. He couldn't give me an answer, and acted like he was doing us a favor with the interest rate. We walked away.

  
My question is am I being crazy? Is there something I'm missing? Am I doing the math wrong? We had negotiated a little more the 1500 off the price of the car. When I did the math on that extra 42 it sure seems like they added something to negate that amount without telling me.",1002,0.94,1002,0,1070.0,68.0,352,1741276130.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1j4ygp5/walking_away_from_car_deal_at_the_last_minute/,False,True
1ln34wr,personalfinance,Disputed a Charge and now the merchant is threatening me,"My front windshield of my car got cracked from a baseball. I called around to multiple glass shops to get prices and such. Due to the kind of car I have, it cost extra because of the safety cameras and extra nonsense so everyone said it was an extra 300 dollars to recalibrate it after the windshield if replaced. I settled on a shop, took my car there and they replaced the windshield and called me to pick it up, but said they accidentally broke the molding around the windshield so they had to order new ones (which I got charged for) AND the windshield they put on had a crack on it and they couldn’t get it recalibrated. They told me they would order a new windshield and molding and have me come back in at a later date. I brought my car back in, they replaced the molding and windshield but ended up calling me saying they couldn’t get it recalibrated. So there is a dash alert in my car and I’ll have to take it somewhere else for them to fix it because they couldn’t. Mind you, it worked fine before they replaced it. I assumed they would take off the recalibration fee and the cost of the molding since it was their screw up, but they didn’t. They took off 100 dollars off the price, that’s it. I explained I’m going to have to take it somewhere else and pay for someone else to fix it and if the recalibration fee is 300 why am I only getting 100 off? No budging from them. So once it posted to my credit card, I disputed it with my bank and explained what happened. The glass shop gave their side of the story and I gave mine to the bank and the bank sided with me and gave me the money back. The next day, the glass shop calls me and says they want their windshield back and if I don’t answer my phone and bring it back they will find me, and cut it out of my car. 
I’m worried my car is going to get vandalized at this point because of the unprofessional behavior of them. The only legal thing they can do is take me to court right?

1o2p2jd,personalfinance,Car dealer says they will not work with outside lenders.,"A local ford dealer has a truck I want, but they said their prices are so low, they will not work with an outside lender.
Am I a bad person if I accept their 7.49% financing and immediately refi it thru my credit union for 2 % less?

I know some people say the dealership has a right to be paid for their services, but I feel like it is a shady practice to try to force me to pay a higher rate than I qualify for.


Update:found a similar truck, 2024 F150 XLT 3.5L Hybrid with about 2k more miles on it 3 hrs away.  Salesman said they will match price, accept my CU financing.  Only problem is it’s white and I really liked the gray truck.  I can live with the white one 

Next update: the new dealership uses fees to make their profit.
UCI(used car inspection)-$1995
Inspection fee-$123.75
Processing fee(in addition to $225 doc fee)-$399

Another update: went back to “no outside financing” dealer and bought truck.  They were actually pleasant to work with.  The sales lady ran my credit, let me know I got 1% better than the original quote.  The finance mgr was very upfront and not pushy at all about extended warranties.  
Definitely one of the better car buying experiences I’ve ever had.

Last update: Since I was buying this truck to tow my 6500 lb camper, on the test drive, I asked the salesperson if the truck had a trailer brake controller. She said it had an integrated tbc. Since the truck had a lot of tech I was unfamiliar with, I accepted her answer.
When I went back after deciding to buy the truck, I asked her again and she told me the same thing.  
When I got the truck home, I figured I better spend a little time getting familiar with this integrated brake controller so I started researching.  
Guess what…where there would be a brake controller, I had a coin holder.

After explaining how much of a mess it could’ve been if I had been pulling my trailer and got in a situation where the controller was needed, the sales mgr offered to install one.  But, his plan was to screw an aftermarket controller underneath the dash of my new truck and that wasnt acceptable.  

I told him “No, if you can’t do it right, don’t bother”, then deleted and rewrote my google review for this ford dealer.

1ib02am,personalfinance,Why does buying my house feel like such a scam?,"I've entered the steps to buy a house, and although it was called off for unrelated reasons - this made re-evaluated the true 'value' of a home. I've heard the 'best practice' to buy a home was to keep it at least for 5-6 years and punched some numbers - using the assumption that you buy the house, keep it for 6 years, then sell it afterwards.

Assumption: $377K home, 5.875% interest rate, 30% down payment, 15-year mortgage.

Total money paid out **across 6 years**: -$351,763

* Down payment: -$113,100
* P&amp;I for 6 years: -$159,060 ($2209 per month)
* Fixed costs: $-36,720 ($510 in property tax, HOA, Home Ins./month)
* Selling costs: -$42,883(Assuming that the house appreciated in value 6% per year to $504,511 after 6 years, using 8.5% of the value/price of the home after 6 years)

Total money paid in **across 6 years**: +$319,551

* Equity Built by paying off home (down payment (113.1K) + principal across 6 years) = +$192,040
* Appreciation across 6 years = $127,511

Total net proceeds = $319,551- $346,041 = -$32,212. Meaning you actually lose $32K by buying then selling after 6 years.

\--------------------------------------

Compare this to my scenario in renting:

Total money paid out **across 6 years**: -$114,807

* I pay $1,450 a month. Assuming 5% increase per year (these numbers are for my area only), I pay $17400/18270/19184/20143/21150/22207 across years 1\~6

If I put the down payment in a HYSA, not even the extra I could be putting towards it considering that I pay significantly less money towards housing than in rent

* Starting money: Down payment of would-be house = $113,100, this grows to $135,835 in a HYSA making **total net proceeds to be +$17,482**
* And assuming that I put extra $650 per month, because let's say this is the opportunity cost of putting it in here instead of putting it in a mortgage: the net proceeds becomes **$188,204 after 6 years, making total net proceeds to be $69,851**.

And this is a super, super safer side of the investment, using HYSA to 'invest' instead of something a little bit more aggressive like a index fund.

**My TLDR here, is that isn't paying interest more of a scam than renting?? \*important note: if i buy then sell in 6-10 years time**

She’s always had a ton of debt due to raising me and my sister as a single mother during the recession. I thought she was making progress on this, but then she told me since her credit score was so bad she wouldn’t get approved for any of the places we were trying to rent, so she needed me to co-sign so we could get into a place quick. I was 23 and knew pretty much nothing about this stuff, and she told me it was only temporary and would be removed from my account later.  I believe when moving into the new place my credit score was in the 700s.

It’s now a year and a half later and I’m trying to move out and educate myself more about this stuff. I needed a credit report for one of the places I’m looking into, and upon looking it over I see my score has dropped down to 560, and there’s 22,000 dollars of debt on my card in my name. I was obviously very upset and asked her what this was about, she told me she was working on getting it removed and that it will go away after a couple months because she is refinancing it into a debt consolidation loan, but from what I’m reading this will be following me for another 7 years. On the report too it’s saying I’ve been getting hit with over due payments since August, up to 150 days in December, and then getting hit with a “charge off” every month since February.

I’m beyond confused on what to do, and honestly don’t understand all of this. I know I should have been more careful, but now that I’m in this situation I’m not sure how to proceed. I feel I’m just starting out and already have a massive stain on my credit report. She says not to worry about it, but I know she’s very bad with this stuff so I feel I can’t trust her. Is it true this will be removed from my record? Or am I just stuck with this stain on my account? 

How can I get out of this situation? Or at least any advice on how to improve it would be very helpful.

1juty5w,personalfinance,"Backdoor Roth at Fidelity took less than 5 minutes. If you've been putting it off like me, don't.","I hate worrying about bumping up against the income limit and knew that doing a backdoor Roth would eliminate the need to worry, but I avoided learning how to do it correctly and kept procrastinating. I shouldn't have.

Once I learned what I needed to learn, it took less than 5 minutes on the Fidelity site.

* Get money into your Fidelity cash management account or the cash portion of your brokerage account. I sent a wire from my HYSA. It was free and done same day instead of using ACH and waiting for funds to clear.
* Open a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA at Fidelity if you don't already have them. I had a  Roth, but no traditional. Setting up the traditional took seconds.
* Once funds from the first step are clear, use the Fidelity ""transfer"" option to move the funds to the traditional IRA. This also took seconds.
* You should immediately be able to use the ""transfer"" option again to move the entire balance from traditional to Roth.  This also took seconds. Instead of choosing the option to transfer the full amount, use partial amount, but input the entire value (I've read this makes it clear immediately, and it did in my case).
* The funds are now in the cash portion of your Roth. Invest in your favorites.
* Repeat next year.

You'll have to do your own due diligence regarding your eligibility, tax implications (including if you are affected by pro-rata rule), etc.**",938,0.94,938,0,1002.0,64.0,131,1744161494.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1juty5w/backdoor_roth_at_fidelity_took_less_than_5/,False,True

1mwi6jj,personalfinance,Mortgage Company just waived PMI with nothing but an email,"Yup, just took $200/mo off my monthly payment by sending an email to the mortgage co.

I'm 1) pumped how easy this was but 2) pissed I didn't do this 2 years ago.

We bought our house in 2020 and only put down 10%.  I have not been paying anything early because im in no rush to remove the cheapest debt i have (3%). Our home value (as most have) has gone up a lot since we bought in 2020. I just passed the 20% equity line based on original home value, but the mortgage company doesn't automatically remove PMI until you hit 25% which in my case would've been 2 more years. All i did was fill out a 1 page form and email it to Service Mac and they took off the monthly charge. Cant believe how easy that was.

The bummer is that because of how much home values have gone up in my area (Southern NE), my equity level based on current value has been above 35% for like 2 years.. which means i couldve done this very simple task much earlier.

Im a lurker by trade but feel compelled to share this with as many people as possible... if you bought a home with less than 20% down between 2019 and 2022, please, please, go check with your mortgage company and see if you can have PMI removed early. $200 a month may not be life changing but it does offset some of the big increases in taxes and homeowners insurance from the last few years.",928,0.93,928,0,1004.0,76.0,210,1755798880.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1mwi6jj/mortgage_company_just_waived_pmi_with_nothing_but/,False,True

1hlv3il,personalfinance,My (37) Parents came clean about financial disaster and I don’t know where to start,"I’m looking for directional advice on where to look to start tackling the financial disaster that my parents have created. If anyone has thoughts on avenues to help address this situation and considerations that I need to account for, that would be enormously helpful. I live in IL and my folks live in NJ

History: If you don’t want additional context you can skip to The Situation.

Me: I’m 37 (M) married with a five month old. I’ve been in sales engineering for 12 years and have built myself a decent nest egg. Ever since I saw my parents weather the financial crisis, I’ve realized how important it is to be economically stable. Recently, my parents, who are otherwise wonderful people, came to me asking for help organizing their finances and what I saw horrified me.

Parents: My dad (72) is a self made entrepreneur and my mom (71) was a preschool teacher. I grew up in a loving, upper middle class household. My dad owns a small business in market research for 30 years that was very successful. He managed to make it through the .com bubble and the financial crisis relatively unscathed. While there were scary times, he was always able to pull it out. 

Covid was a different monster. His company hung by a thread, but my dad always knew he was going to make it through. His hubris got the best of him and he started lending the company money to keep it afloat. He put everything into it and I mean everything. I knew it was bad when he asked me for money a couple of years ago. I understood the risks and loaned them the money. He asked again a year later and I gave them a small infusion to hold them over.

They came to visit me after the birth of my daughter five months ago. I could tell that they were distracted when, what should’ve been a happy occasion, felt somber. They told me that they were falling behind on their bills, so I started to ask questions. I knew things were tough at the business, but I didn’t know how bad things were, and frustratingly, neither did they. They told me that their credit card payments were getting too high, which I foolishly thought that they had some big purchases, but when I questioned them further the money was for minimum payments on their credit card. I essentially told them that I would help them out if they gave me the full picture as long as the money goes to them and not interest payments.

The Situation:
Flash forward to last week. They finally come clean with their financials and it was way worse than I thought. My dad borrowed from their entire nest egg to keep his business afloat. Not only did he borrow from his 401K and his IRA’s, but it went so much deeper. He borrowed millions from his and my mom’s retirement. They finally opened up their books up to me and I was shocked

Debts
Credit card debts: adds up to $92K across seven different cards. Some of these cards my dad is the main card holder and some are in my mom’s name. Their total minimum payments come to ~$3,300/month and the interest rates vary from 14% to 33%
Car Debt: They leased a car in my dad’s name from GM Financial with $532 payments and a buyout  price of $38,530 
House Debt: They owe ~$90K on their mortgage and took a HELOC with ~$60K left. 
Bank Account: $300 overdrawn

Monthly Expenses
Variable Expenses: ~$3100/month across groceries, internet, car, etc
Insurance: $2600/month this includes
* Life insurance ($1.5M): $1,200
* Long Term Care: $800
* Medicare Supplement: $300
* Various other policies: $300
Mortgage+Taxes: $3,230/month at a 4.25% rate
* Because all of this happened as a result of COVID, they qualified for a 12 month reprieve on housing expenses. The stipulation is that they don’t sell the house or refinance for three years.

Asset:
House: would say that this is their best asset and could conservatively sell for $600K. They live in a development with three home layouts and one with their layout sold for $850K in the last month. Their unit is much less updated and needs a little work to get it ready.
Social Security: $5,150/month

Cash Flow:
Current total expenses: ~$12,400/month
Total Income: $5,150 + some teaching jobs they’ve picked up
Net: -$7,250

Today: 
There are obviously some emotional and behavioral factors that need to be addressed  in the situation. I’m not looking for feedback on whether or not I should help - I first want to stabilize the situation and set them up for longer term sustainability.

Initially, I was going to pay off their credit cards and buy out the rest of their mortgage then they would transfer the deed to me. This would allow them to live in the house for essentially free (paying taxes and HOI), but as I dug more into the situation, I’m realizing that this is a bit above my pay grade. My sense is to go to a bankruptcy lawyer to help unwind this mess. I’m not sure if there are other avenues that we need to explore.

1k7akc9,personalfinance,Life insurance denied after my brother’s suicide — looking for advice,"My brother died by suicide in November 2024. It has been the most traumatic experience of my life—and something my family and I are still navigating every day.

My mom remembered that he had a life insurance policy with Aflac, something he told her about years ago. She’s the personal representative of his estate and has spent the last five months trying to navigate the claims process, which has been an absolute nightmare.

She’s had to send and resend documents, often by fax (even though they clearly have email), only to be told Aflac never received them. Every time she called, she had to re-explain what happened—that her son died by suicide. That part alone was retraumatizing. She was constantly told to call back later or start over.

Eventually, a mutual friend connected us with a VP at Aflac, and only then did someone finally get in touch with her. And when they did, it was just to say the claim was denied due to suicide. No copy of the full policy- just a basic page. No clarification about the listed beneficiary. No proof of signatures. No offer of premium refunds. Just: “Denied.”

But here’s the thing—this policy has been active for years. I’ve read that most suicide exclusions in life insurance policies only apply within the first 1-2 years of the policy being active. If that’s true, wouldn’t he be past that period? And even if they’re within their rights to deny, isn’t there at least a refund of premiums?

This entire process has been exhausting and so deeply unfair. My brother’s longtime girlfriend and two young children were supposed to receive $200k from this policy—money that would’ve made a huge difference for their lives. Now, nothing.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? Any advice on how we can fight this or at least get some transparency? A lawyer? A complaint to a state insurance commissioner? Anything? We are in New Mexico.

1nkc4uj,personalfinance,Dad died and pension won't pay.,"Hello - I could use some help.

So my dad died suddenly in feb 2024. He did not have a will so I have done the steps become the administator of his estate. He was divorced in 2020 and in the divorce she was supposed to get half of pension if death occurred. She was able to get around $50,000 after his death from the pension.

I found a document that he requested for what he would get if he pulled out early as of Jan 1 2020 and the document states he would get a lump sum of $287,514.96.  He did not pull out but needed this for the divorce.

Now that we have the administration letters we have started the process of collecting the funds and they told us the amount to get is $28,835.49. I requested a recalculations and they sent the same number. I am confused on what to do from here as it does not make sense that the amount of money decreased that much. I think his ex wife would have gotten more and we are entitled to more.

The new calculation document they sent does not show anything about the divorce payout.",877,0.91,877,0,973.0,96.0,134,1758210969.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nkc4uj/dad_died_and_pension_wont_pay/,False,True

I expected it to be a check or goodbye card. Instead, when i opened it up i realized it was a debit card. I regularly recieve my payment as direct deposit and have always received my payment as direct deposit. I called my job and they said that the card had already been loaded and the only option I had was to activate the card and transfer the money to my real bank account.

I do not know what to do. I would like to possibly work for this company again in the future and do not want to ruin a work relationship or reference. What should I do?????

Edit:
I called the phone number on the card and they said the only way to access the funds is to give them my details to activate the card. It seems that if I activate my card I will not be able to access my funds by direct deposit or check.

1jj1de7,personalfinance,Collector hung up on me when asked for debt validation letter,"Edit to update:

I appreciate everyone’s feedback and advice. After looking through it and other subs I’ve decided to settle it for a payment plan with them. I called Citibank and they said it was charged off and sold to the creditor that called me, so it’s legit. I’m gonna try to repair my credit as much as possible. I understand that buying a house soon and being in this position makes it seem like I’m really not in the position to be purchasing a house at all. While I agree, life doesn’t stop happening. We will need to buy a house soon for personal reasons, and I’m doing my best to get back on my feet after all the insanity from when my husband got injured. We are awaiting a settlement for the injury, and hope to move on from this soon. I called them back, and set up a payment plan, and plan to pay it off for significantly less in about 2 months. I’m over the stress and still have one more company to negotiate with for over 9k from a medical procedure I had with care credit. Thank you for all the replies and support and I’ll update once I’m out of the trenches.



Hi everyone, I’m hoping I can get some help here. I recently called a collector about a debt I owed Citibank. 

Yes I am stupid because I asked if we could settle for $100 a month for x months. She kept going on about how it was transferred to a litigation department but no attorney has reviewed it yet. 

I asked if they bought it and she said “we own the account” I think she thought she was going to pull one over on me, I’m a fairly young girl and after teetering back and fourth on what I could pay, I asked if they could send me a debt validation letter. Instantly was silent and then she hung up after a couple minutes. What are my options here? I don’t want to get sued, but I also don’t want anyone knowing I owe this debt because I’m trying to buy a house soon. (Please don’t lecture me I beat myself up every day) it’s $2,805.

I told them my husband lost his job etc (he was actually injured) but what can i do? ",863,0.95,863,0,911.0,48.0,95,1742848972.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jj1de7/collector_hung_up_on_me_when_asked_for_debt/,False,True
1m3861d,personalfinance,"Dad has been in a nursing home for several months, now found out he's being evicted and lost his job","My (26) dad (61) was hospitalized in March and has since been in rehab getting stronger. He's ready for discharge home, but just found out his employer has evicted him and terminated employment. The situation is a little odd since he's a groundskeeper and lives on company property with ""rent"" being taken out of his paychecks. He was there for over a decade, employer handled utilities and maintenance, but **never had an actual renter agreement**

He has no savings and our local housing authority does not have any public housing availability (wait-list also closed). I have stable income and would be able to cover deposits for my dad, but I'm not sure how either of us would pay his rent. 

Other notes: He does have Medicaid. We live in a low to medium cost of living town in VA. Average rent is around $1500 and haven't found anything less than $900. I don't have room in my tiny home to accommodate him. No family or friends available either.

1hygyj4,personalfinance,I’m an idiot. Rolled my 401(k)s into my new employers plan and regretting my decision.,"So, as the post heading says, I am an idiot and do not know enough about personal finance. The least I could’ve done was a cursory search of Google or Reddit before I made this decision but alas, here we are.

I had multiple 401(k)s out there from past employers and decided it would be nice to have them all in one place. The old 401(k)s were at Principal and Fidelity and my new company uses Empower. I spoke to someone at empower who told me what a great idea it would be to roll everything to them, but never mentioned that I should check into asset management fees. Today I checked my retirement balance and saw that I will be getting charged about $200 a year in fees at Empower. Not crazy, but I looked at statements from my old 401(k)’s and I don’t see any asset management fees. Not sure how that’s possible, but maybe the companies were paying them even after I left. Also, now that I’ve done that cursory Google search, it seems like Fidelity just has lower fees overall.

Anyways, I talked to a retirement advisor at empower today and she apologized, saying that they should have gone over that and she would’ve told me if I was thinking of rolling over that I should look into fees. Yeah thanks but too late. 

Wishing I could reverse the transactions but assuming that’s not possible. I do not have an IRA and I’m not sure if that’s something I should look in to. Maybe these fees aren’t actually very high at all, but it seems like they’re taking my money for no reason since it’s in a target date fund.

Some context,  I am almost 40, high earner, target date fund 2045. 

Thanks in advance for your advice, and any roasting I receive because internet.


Edit-Update: First of all, thank you to most of you for the great advice regarding this issue. I took all of your advice in, and took the time to educate myself more about this issue. For those that felt the need to troll and make snarky comments, next time maybe you can just scroll past. No one wants to hear you. And for those wondering why I was ‘wasting’ all this time over $200, it actually ended up being a lot more than that, and really it was the want/need to understand the situation better and educate myself about financial issues that will affect me the rest of my life. So well worth it. Perhaps instead of taking the time to be awful humans from behind your computer in your dark sad room, you should also try this. 

Also wanted to post this update as a thanks to the people that did help and for those saying that they were interested in following this post so they wouldn’t make the same mistake. Hopefully I have summed up all the great comments here.

What I found is that there was indeed a stark difference between the gross expense ratio from Fidelity and the gross investment expenses at empower. While these things are named differently at different institutions, they are the same. They are not something you will see in your 401k transaction history, but instead built into the share price of the plan. They are basically the cost to manage the plan and all institutions have them. You can find them in your plan description, plan summary, or fee comparison documents in your account (I say either because often the ‘fee schedule’ on one document will reference another document entirely). 
In addition to this, empower charges a general administrative services fee, which is .22% in my case. This is something that I was not charged by any previous employer. Empower says that this is an additional expense that is sometimes wholly paid by employers, but sometimes (all or partially) passed on to employees. This is what was showing in my transaction history and the $46 I referred to in the original post. In my case, it looks like all of the fee is passed on from my employer to its employees. This was not the case at any previous employer (they paid the entire fee) so that kind of sucks.

So all told, basically I am paying four times the amount in management and administrative fees to have my money at empower than I was at Fidelity (0.58% vs 0.14%, respectively). I haven’t looked into principal because the majority of the rollover money came from Fidelity and that’s what I’m focusing on here. 

I also appreciate the comment from the person about the DOL2022–02 rule. I looked into that and indeed these companies are supposed to do a fee comparison or at least tell you to compare fees before looking into rolling over your money from one account to another. I won’t go into too much detail, but when I brought this up to empower, they got pretty nasty. Which caused me to file a complaint with them. Not sure how much good that will do, but I am currently looking into IRAs to roll my rollover money into that have lower expense ratios. I am, however, trying to get more information about the rule of 55 and if that applies to rollover money at empower, which should be part of the plan description, but I can’t find it and neither can they. That might also factor into my decision to open an IRA and roll this money there. 

Hopefully this helps someone else with rollovers, thanks for the feedback from some saying that this was helpful. Don’t make the mistake that I did and wait to educate yourself about something until after you do it. And the big Takeaway is to look into all these fees before you make any moves. I’m still an idiot because I didn’t even know these existed. But I’m less of an idiot now, because of the fine people of Reddit, and various financial websites. Happy New Year to all.

1nxlx68,personalfinance,NYT: How Stocks Can Be Quietly Stolen From Your I.R.A.,"I thought I'd share [this article from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/03/your-money/ira-vanguard-merrill-acats-fraud.html) as this is pretty terrifying to me, and second I know many people don't check their retirement / brokerage accounts that often. I don't think the problem is limited to Vanguard, it sounds like a problem with the ACATS system. FTA:

&gt;The day before the presidential election, Mr. Tran, who oversees his family’s retirement accounts, decided to sell a solar energy stock inside his wife’s Roth individual retirement account...he discovered that half of the holdings inside that Vanguard account had vanished.

&gt;Mr. Tran called Vanguard, which froze the I.R.A. and began to investigate. The money, it turns out, had been whisked away four days earlier, and transferred to another brokerage platform, Merrill Edge.

&gt;A criminal impostor opened two accounts in Mr. Tran’s wife’s name at Merrill and requested the transfer from Vanguard, but the fraudster hadn’t yet run off with the money. Merrill, part of Bank of America, froze the funds.

&gt;...

&gt;It happens frequently enough: Regulators have issued notices in recent years warning that this type of crime — known as ACATS fraud — was on the rise.

&gt;...

&gt;It often happens like this: The criminal opens up a new account in a target’s name, using stolen data or a combination of stolen and false information (like an email address or a mobile phone number). Opening an account at Merrill Edge, as well as many other online brokers, doesn’t require much. That’s what the fraudsters did here, and Bank of America said it had received the all clear when it had run identify verification checks.

&gt;With the new account, the impostor can request a transfer from another existing account, just like a real customer, which the institutions complete through the ACATS framework.

&gt;...

&gt;With all of those pieces in hand, the transfer can then happen really quickly — ACATS is fast and largely automated.

&gt;...

&gt;“The ACATS process was designed for speed, and doesn’t really have good fraud controls in place,” said Gavin Holland, a financial crimes executive at SAS, a data and artificial intelligence company. The firm holding the assets rarely goes beyond a basic check, and it usually doesn’t even notify the customer that the transfer is about to happen. (Vanguard notifies customers after the transfer is completed.)

&gt;...

&gt;**In a digital world where sophisticated fraudsters are continuously fine-tuning their strategies, the couple’s situation underscores the importance of checking on your accounts — criminals may try to stay under the radar and siphon small amounts at time.**

&gt;**Ask your financial providers what sort of notifications they send if money was transferred out, make sure the alerts are turned on and ask the firms if they have locking features to prevent this type of activity. If they don’t, demand them. Always use two-factor authentication, guard your brokerage account numbers and shred paper statements if you absolutely insist on receiving them that way. Practice good email hygiene, too.**",843,0.95,843,0,890.0,47.0,80,1759556858.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nxlx68/nyt_how_stocks_can_be_quietly_stolen_from_your_ira/,False,True

I filed for unemployment last night and now I just feel completely immobilized. I know my resume sucks, and I have a hard time describing what I did because it’s a pretty niche field. The job fell into my lap 3 years ago and was a godsend at the time.

I’ll get paid until January 15th. Husband and I think we can tighten our belts and avoid touching our emergency fund. My job accounted for about 40% of our income so we’re definitely gonna feel it, but we live pretty frugally and saved aggressively.

It took me 10 months to find this last job. I’m so worried because it seems like the job market is even worse now.

There’s also the shame of it. Husband is telling me that it’s nothing to be embarrassed of, that most people get laid off at some point in their lives and I did nothing wrong. But I blame myself for choosing a crappy degree instead of something in STEM.

I started talking classes a few months back and now I’m working on a degree in chemical engineering with a loooong way to go. I like the idea of going back to school full time and trying to get some part time work to keep us afloat.

I couldn’t sleep last night. My mind and my heart have been racing for almost a full day now. I’m not posting for pity. But if my husband is right, I’m hoping there are folks out there who can tell me about their layoff story and what happened in the long run. 

Also if anyone can offer advice in the unemployment process. I’m in Texas.

1kescxm,personalfinance,Avoiding overfunding 529 accounts,"I would like to offer some unsolicited advice concerning the optimal funding level for 529s, in hopes that other people won't make the same mistake that I did.

I set up 529 accounts for my children as soon as 529s became available.  I had struggled financially for seven years of college and law school, so I wanted my children to be able to attend any college that made sense for them, regardless of cost.  Frequently, my  wife and I made annual contributions at the maximum permissible level (based on the then-current Gift Tax exemption).  I funded the accounts with the idea that, if my children got into expensive, Ivy League, schools, there would be sufficient 529 money to cover that expense.

Then life happened. My children went to State schools (my daughter went to the same school as my wife and I did). My daughter completed college in three years. My father-in-law insisted on being involved in paying some of the bills. Neither of my children has any interest in graduate school, and there are no grandchildren on the horizon. I now have a very considerable amount of ""left over"" 529 money.  If I was to use the money for non-educational purposes, I would need to pay a 10% penalty on the portion of the withdrawal that is investment gain. Since the money has been in the accounts for, in some cases, almost 25 years, it is almost all gain (I think  about 75%).

If I had it to do over again, I would fund the 529s to a level sufficient to cover all the costs for four years at the most expensive State school in my State, with the idea that, if the kid got into a more expensive school, we would figure that out.

One smart thing that I did was that, during each year of high school, I moved one year's worth of costs from a stock option to a short-term option, like money market, or a short-term bond market. That way, when the kid graduated from high school, he/she had four years' worth of college costs in an account that was free of market risk.  I was in college during the 1981-82 recession, and I personally knew people who had to leave my college class (at a Big 10 State college), and go back home to a community college, because the stock market fall had eliminated a lot of their college money.

So, lesson learned:  Just as you can put away too little money for college, you can also put away too much. Moderation is a good thing.",828,0.9,828,0,932.0,103.0,244,1746387445.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kescxm/avoiding_overfunding_529_accounts/,False,True

It’s gonna need major repairs and upgrades within the next 2 years (new HVAC, new plumbing, new insulation, new roof, new appliances). I can afford the repairs, but I was wondering if it’s better to sell my house as is (I would make $150-200k), wait for the markets to go down, and then buy a newly built house later on? Or keep the house, repair everything, and rent it out? Or is there another option? We each make $130k/year and no debts (except for mortgage)if that helps you guys answer my question.  Thank you in advance.

EDIT: Thanks for your replies everyone. I will rent out my house first and then sell it if it being and landlord doesn’t work out. ",830,0.83,830,0,1044.0,214.0,505,1748036237.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ktvb34/wife_and_i_have_both_have_our_own_homes_what_to_do/,False,True

1ku5f2x,personalfinance,Dentist Threatening Collections After Credit Card Dispute Was Resolved in My Favor,"Last year, my dentist created a crown on one tooth—twice—but both crowns came off within hours and were completely unusable. Later, he admitted he couldn’t place a secure crown because the tooth was too short. I’ve been living without a crown since then.

I asked the dentist to cancel the charge, but he refused. Last month, I disputed the charge with my credit card company, and they ruled in my favor after reviewing the case.

However, this week I received a payment demand letter from the dentist, which states:
	•	If I don’t pay by the end of the month (by cash or check), he will add interest,
	•	Previously applied discounts will be removed,
	•	The account may be sent to collections.

This has made me extremely anxious.

If the credit card company resolved the dispute in my favor and reversed the charge, do I still have any legal obligation to pay again? And if I ignore the dentist’s threats, is there a risk to my credit?

I submitted a complaint to the CFPB today, but I’d really appreciate advice on how else I can protect myself—especially my credit score. Should I consider hiring an attorney?

1m5fybq,personalfinance,Should I sell my home in the Caribbean to buy a house in the U.S. and become debt-free?,"Hey everyone, I’m 33M, married with two kids (ages 10 and 6), and I’ve been living in Connecticut since 2011. I'm a U.S. citizen and work full-time in the trucking industry, earning about $60,000/year.

Back in 2019, I used profits from trading stocks to help buy a house in my home country in the Caribbean. I put down about $130,000 cash and took a mortgage for the remaining ~$130K. It was actually my mother’s idea—she had plans around the property too, but sadly, she passed away a year later. That’s part of why the property means something to me, but at the same time, it hasn’t been a great financial move since then.

Right now, that home is worth around $425,000, and I still owe about $130,000. I’ve been renting it on Airbnb, but after mortgage, HOA fees, utilities, housekeeping, and management, I only make around $600/month profit, and even less in off-seasons. It’s been stressful to manage remotely, and there’s added pressure now—my HOA has threatened to shut down Airbnb rentals, so the future income is uncertain.

Worse, the mortgage is variable and currently at 10.5% interest, with no fixed-rate or refinance options available locally. That rate has climbed steadily, making the house even less financially viable.

Meanwhile in the U.S., I’ve got about $30K in credit card and personal loan debt, and I’m currently renting. So I’m thinking about selling the Caribbean house, paying off the mortgage, and walking away with about $265K net.

Here’s my plan if I sell:

Put 20% down on a $66K)

Pay off all my debts (~$30K)

Start college funds for my kids

Invest ~$75K in index funds or CDs

Keep ~$20K in high-yield savings for emergencies

Use income from work to build a future home back home slowly, debt-free


I’d be left with no debt except a U.S. mortgage, a stable home for my family, and room to save and grow.

I like having something back home, but with everything considered—the limited income, rising interest, remote stress, and life here—it’s feeling more like a weight than an asset.

Would you sell and start fresh? Or am I giving up long-term value too soon?

1lijedt,personalfinance,Waking up in a financial nightmare that I have had for many years and never admitted to it.,"  
I'm in my late 50s, no savings, no retirement, light health problems, and a failing small business. With overdue taxes and credit card debt, I'm probably 80k in debt, and for years I haven't told myself or anyone else how bad my financial situation is. My credit score is around 550, and my daughter is starting school next year. While she has money for her high grades and some from the state (might be the only time my finances help anyone), I need to find a way to help her too. That's amazingly important because I know what my debt is like—I don't want her to start hers in the same place.

The lady at the BK office said they would make me sell my house, and I can't do that because with bad credit and no steady income, I couldn't rent even a studio apartment.

I can't believe I am writing this ""out loud,"" but I can't hide from it anymore.

The only people who knew my situation were the ones I tried to get money from. Great deal on a house that I lost the savings on in a high-rate mortgage (4.5%), which at the time sucked, and it (as with everyone, it feels like) is watching the value plummet down. I have a few-years-old pickup I bought because I didn't have the money to fix my beater, and I have high payments and am upside down in it. I guess my bad credit makes my car insurance go up. When did that start?

I have to say, it actually feels good to take a breath and let it out. So any advice, direction, or story of how someone got out of this place—I would really appreciate the help. Thanks in advance.

1kkhvum,personalfinance,Accidentally overdrafted a $50 Visa Prepaid Card at Costco Gas – will this cause any issues?,"Hi everyone,

A while ago, I got a $50 Visa Prepaid Card from attending a Hyatt Vacation Club presentation. I used it to fill up gas twice at Costco.

The first time, I spent a little over $40. Thinking there was still a small balance left, I went back another day and started pumping gas again. I assumed the pump would automatically stop once the $50 was used up—but it didn’t. I ended up pumping another $40+ worth of gas. Later, I learned that you’re *not supposed* to use prepaid cards directly at the pump, but rather go inside and ask the cashier to charge a fixed amount.

Now the card shows a negative balance of around -$30. The card is non-reloadable, so I can’t pay the difference even if I wanted to. I called customer service, and they told me the system will automatically wipe the negative balance and that I won’t be liable for anything.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Will this actually affect me in any way—like credit score, collections, or issues with future Visa cards?

1iyp28m,personalfinance,I think I finally understand Backdoor Roth IRA and why everyone seems to constantly say you need to do it.,"Please anyone feel free to correct me! 
I (36M) am making this post as it has been hard to find things that aligned with my thoughts. 

I have spent a while trying to figure out if doing a backdoor roth is even worth it compared to dumping it in my normal brokerage account and it hadn’t really seemed worth it. I finally had the epiphany last night. 

With my taxable brokerage account a best case scenario (for me) would be long term capital gains at 15%. 
Worst case pending where life takes me would be up to 24%+ 

However by doing a backdoor Roth my worst case would be I need money and I withdraw contributions before the 5 years is up and it’s a flat 10% penalty and that is it… 
And a more likely case if nothing crazy happens is that I need money and I’ve hit the 5 year and I can just take my contributions out as needed as long as I don’t touch any growth or funds less than 5 years old…  

So overall it seems whether or not I need money in a year and one day or I need it in 35 years by having the Roth as an option it would be 5-24%+ difference in actual money… before I thought I’m not rich so a couple percent inefficiency doesn’t move the needle but now I realize it’s much more than a couple percent. 

I have been fortunate enough these last couple years to be in a place I can max my 401k and my HSA and still be able to have some left over to invest so it has always been a “is it worth the hassle to do a conversion and to have an extra account to track” and it finally appears to be a resounding yes. Given retirement is 30 years away that’s been a hard concept to grasp of what I may need then etc so looking at it in a 1-10 year timeframe for me made all the difference. 

I hope others that are starting out find this useful as well and I hope anyone that has been doing this a while can expose any inaccuracies in my thought process.

1kjx1ay,personalfinance,Scammed out of life savings - seeking next steps,"I just learned about this in a call with my mom that my aunt was scammed out of her life savings. 
Here’s a brief summary of the situation:
My aunt met a person on social media likely back in 2024. The scammer used tactics that made my aunt felt romantically attached. She believed them when they presented her an opportunity to jointly invest in a crypto. We’re only learning about all this because she asked us to lend her money to pay off her credit card debt. Other family members were skeptical and told her a few months ago that it was definitely a scam. My aunt didn’t believe it and proceeded to link and transfer $270k from her bank account to a fake crypto site. The scammer went no contact this week and her life savings was all gone. She is also in the process of selling her house right now, but I doubt selling the house would cover all the debt since she took on additional loan and will need to pay off the mortgage first. Another thing is, she’s in the middle of a divorce so her ex will be entitled to 1/3 of the proceeds from the house. 
Summary of the damage: $270k in cash + at least $40k credit card debt + mortgage + money she needs to repay people who lent her. She is too embarrassed to even file a police report at this moment. 
What is the best course of action here? Declare bankruptcy? If so, before of after selling the house? What type of lawyer should she speak to? Anyway I can help her in this process?

I also save money by shopping at local, often foreign-owned grocery stores that offer lower prices than places like ShopRite. Even produce is cheaper there.

And here's another factor: in NYC, I don’t need to own a car. Subway fare is way cheaper than car payments, insurance, maintenance, and gas—especially with how much people drive in Florida.

1nu68ge,personalfinance,529 Account—My Family Dropped the Ball,"I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit but this seems like a fair place to ask. My grandfather died in 2020 when I was 16, he was elderly and had health complications before Covid was a factor—this is to say his death was expected. After his passing I found out he had left me an account to use for college. My aunt had power of attorney over his accounts and was responsible for transferring all responsibility and information to me so I could go to college. At this point I wasn’t concerned because I had 2 years to figure this out before going to school. 

2022 rolls around and I start college at a local state school and I still don’t have access to this account. This means that I lived at home to save money because I don’t know how much money is in this account, what kind of account it is, or when I’d get access to it. My aunt gives me the runaround and tells me that she will take care of it at a later date, which never comes. I consistently reach out and ask about status updates—and make it clear I’m worried this account is one that can only be used for school purposes and that I should get it ASAP. 

I am now a senior in college. 

Fast forward to this week, and I finally get a breakthrough. My aunt reaches out and tells me that it is a 529 account, and that a specialist is looking into my account to get it transferred to me because my grandpa and grandma have passed and I am now an adult.

Is there any way that I can access the funds in this account without being penalized? I have zero debt because I worked full time and got dean’s list awards. I have no interest in grad school and other training opportunities will be provided by my employer.

I called the hospital, I called MNsure, I called the provider, and the human services county just to try and find answers as to why his insurance didn’t cover for that bill and this was in 2023-2024. I was told that my son didn’t have active insurance for his stay at the NICU which doesn’t make sense. 

Finally, Did a three way call with hospital billing services and my insurance. as the hospital were talking to my insurance. I was THEN told that my son did have insurance at the time of the NICU stay, i thought I was in the clear. and fast forward to now, I was hit with the remaining $37,000 bill from the hospital. Hospital states that they sent the bill to insurance, and then insurance denied payment the first time because they needed more information. So hospital sent them the info they needed and they still denied the bill.. so the hospital decided to take my insurance off of the bill and tried to qualify me for “no insurance discount” and about $31k was deducted from the bill through that. I was NOT notified of any of this. 
And then they decided to put my insurance back on the file and re-sent the bill to my insurance. Insurance finally decided to pay $39,000, but not the full amount. And the reason why they denied it 2x was because they said the hospital filed it back to them “too late”. But I called my insurance today and on the other hand they also said that my son only had health insurance coverage from May 29th until May 31st of 2023. 

3 DAYS OF COVERAGE!! HOW? I don’t know what’s going on . This is long so I just really tried to cut this short even thought there’s a lot more information..sorry if this doesn’t make sense tried to sum it up best I could.
I will be going to the human services county tomorrow. I’m not sure what to ask and what to say, or how to even clear this up, and what the hell is even going on with my insurance! Please help I really have no money to pay for that amount!!

❗️UPDATE ❗️

So I figured out what happened (Sort Of). I will try to explain to the best of my ability. 
The reason why insurance was only willing to pay for the 3 days of June was because he was under the provider of UCARE, which was through me, *The grace period* I’m assuming. 

I did my best to contact both the county and MNsure throughout the whole entire 2 years of my child’s NICU bill. So dating back to when I gave birth. The very 2nd day I gave birth, I promptly notified the state that I gave birth and applied my child for medical assistance(Medicaid). 
As time went on, I got a bill from the hospital stating that I owed $100k. wasn’t understanding why his insurance wasn’t covering the bill so I decided to contact the county. *mind you this was about 1-3 years ago*. I also NEVER received his medical card.

 The very first few times I’ve spoken to the county, they’ve told me that my son didn’t have insurance. I told them I don’t understand why he DIDNT, because I did what I was supposed to do. So then the agent that I was talking to, told me that it was because I never notified them of my pregnancy NOR report my birth. Which was completely FALSE. 

So I called the hospital again looking for ways or ideas to see if they could help me contact insurance and have them speak to insurance themselves in a 3 way call. WITHIN that 3 way call we were able to finally get answers, they provided me with my child’s PMI #, and mind you this was all happening while the hospital billing agent was on call with insurance. *we were on call with the provider UCARE* ( If I can remember correctly since this was a quite while ago). 

I was VERY relieved, and thought I was in the clear. WRONG. Until not too long ago when I received another notice from the hospital stating I owed $37k. As I’ve explained before my update now , I was VERY confused and in distraught. 

I decided to contact the county again to figure out what the helly was going on!?? The county themselves FINALLY told me specifically, he did 
 have coverage for May 2023 through August 2023. He had straight Medical assistance. 

IMPORTANT: I was then also told that he had a duplicate PMI# hence ALL the confusion. His PMI# from UCARE, I believe was duplicated with his straight medical assistance??? *im not sure what the hell that really means but I’m going to call the county again and try to get clarification on THIS* .

I’m so angry because all of this I feel like could’ve been prevented if someone did their job. 

Back to what I was saying, So I connected the call between the county and hospital. The county described what was happening to the hospital, and they finally put the PMI# FROM medical Assitance down. 

HOWEVER The hospital told me his $37k bill has been sent to collections already. I tried to argue with them that I had no clue what was going on and begged them to pull it out of collections . But the hospital billing agent told me that they can’t pull it out of collections due to it being such a HIGH bill.. so the only thing they can do is send the claim to insurance and once insurance pays for that claim, then they will pull it it of collections to have the bill payed for..insane.
 
And she said “let’s see if insurance makes a payment, and if insurance makes a payment that’s fine, but if not then we can try and figure out what to do next”. 
So now I’m left with waiting.. I’m extremely worried that insurance won’t date back that far. But I also feel like this is all extremely unfair to me!!! I’m being blamed for “being too late” by the hospital because they said they sent out multiple notices, but I provided them with the PMI# first time around, it just didn’t go through due to the duplicate PMI#.. so how exactly is that my fault when I had no clue?! Im also very worried with insurance denying the claim too since it was YEARS ago. And when I did try to find answers beforehand, the county DID NOT give me any!! 

The only questions I’m left with is… what do I do if insurance decides NOT to pay for the $37k??",757,0.88,757,0,877.0,120.0,230,1755679336.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1mv9a2m/37000_hospital_bill_for_nicu_baby/,False,True

Yup, it's really that bad. I lost most my 401k when I gave up my job to care for my parents. Unpaid and everything that could go wrong did (plumbing issues, etc). It wrecked me and now I will be looking at working forever. It's okay, honestly, I work in a nursing home and really love the residents and my work. But the pay is awful.

Savings: 60k (yes, total)

No mortgage, old House, needs some repairs, I am in a buyers market: Maybe 400k net. Old carpet, pretty dated home (wood panel), old roof. Great neighborhood though, mature landscaping, college town.

Here's what I am thinking from here. Sale the house, downsize, free up a bit of equity hopefully. My options:

1 - My neighbors have a lot of money, multiple homes, etc. I'm friendly with them, they are good people. They are interested in buying my home for their in-laws or, maybe, their kids. So I would not be going through an agent, but I would use a real estate lawyer. We haven't discussed a price yet but when I inherited it was as assessed at 590k. The good old days. That was 2022. The homes around me are all upgraded and selling for $550k-$500k now. So...maybe $400k for my home. Wild guess here.

2- A friend is a real estate agent and has offered to put it up for sale for me. He thinks it can sale for $500k. I absolutely do not think that.

Again, this is all so beyond my pay grade. It feels pretty helpless, I am honest. I am looking at townhome/condo that averages about 250k-300k. They are small and that's just fine with me.

What a mess, eh? My question is what would you recommend.  Do I live in a van? I'm half way considering it. Because I don't know what I am doing. Any help at all would be so appreciated.

But, I fucked up, and forgot to start paying back my federal student loans after the CARES act was lifted. The emails from nelnet were all in spam. My credit score is now 605. 

I have it set to auto pay now, but it looks like all the delinquent payments really tanked my score. I need to rent a new apartment in ~3 months. Am I screwed? I think I’m probably okay because I have great income. 

I’m admittedly panicking a bit.

Edit 1: I have plans to call nelnet, cross my fingers, and see if they’ll remove some of the late payment reports. Thanks!

Edit 2: Big update for those with loans through Nelnet:

I called them today and spent nearly two hours on the phone. The initial customer service rep was nice but couldn’t help much. Using information and talking points I gathered from this thread, I managed to get transferred to an account manager named Amanda.

Amanda was very firm in defending Nelnet, repeatedly asserting that they had done everything in their power to communicate. When I explained that there might be a backend issue causing emails to go to spam, she insisted it was my email provider’s fault. I pointed out that companies generally need to ensure their emails are properly whitelisted to avoid this, but she kept redirecting the blame, saying Nelnet’s emails don’t go to her spam, so they shouldn’t go to mine.

At one point, I tried to escalate the call to her boss, because this seems like a pretty serious technical oversight, but she flat-out refused. No matter what I said or how I framed it, she would not let me talk to anyone else. It was kind of wild. She directly told me that she wouldn’t escalate my call under any circumstance. 

We also discussed retroactive forbearance, which she said is only available in special circumstances like military service or natural disasters—none of which applied to me.

It was a frustrating conversation, but not necessarily a surprising one, given how many people are behind on their student loan payments and the fact that these delinquencies have only recently started being reported to credit agencies. It feels like a mess a lot of people are going to be dealing with all at once.

1o04d40,personalfinance,Employer is outright taking my 401(k) contributions,"This is going to sound insane, but we called the 401(k) administrator, and they confirmed that this is what is happening:

I logged into my wife's 401(k) last week, and saw that her contributions over the last month+ were deposited into the account, shares FXAIX were purchased, and then the shares were sold a few days later and the money was debited back out. The 401(k) company said it was done from the employer's end. The funds have been withheld from her paycheck. The employer didn't refund us the money or anything when they took it out of the 401k, so from our perspective the money has essentially vanished.

She sent a message to HR a few business days ago, and they have been unresponsive so far, which kind of gobsmacks me for an issue like this. I have a few questions:

1) Suggestions for how to light a fire under their collective asses to get this fixed without getting my wife fired? This seems like a major issue, so I'd have thought they'd be more responsive.

2) There have been a lot of gains in the last couple of months. My wife puts in the maximum legal amount (which is just under $2k/month), so the lost gains and dividends are significant. Is there any legal path that we can go down to recoup that?

EDIT: To be clear, I do not believe this is malice, I think it's a mistake. The amounts that have disappeared have done so a couple of days after the contributions, and it has been exactly what was contributed, which leads me to believe it's something automated clawing back the contributions due to a mistake by a human somewhere. To answer some of the questions in the comments, she is not an HCE, and it is a safe harbor plan, so this is not due to an unbalanced plan. This is a middle-sized multi-state company with an employee count in the thousands, so it's highly unlikely that it's outright fraud, far more likely that somebody just really screwed up. My desire is to get appropriate priority for this, not to go nuclear.

EDIT2: We got the names of some of the one-level-up folks and called them directly rather than attempting to work through the HR ticket system. They now seem extremely concerned.  We sent them copies of the statements showing the transactions and they are working with the 401k administrator to figure out what happened.

EDIT3: The incompetence boggles the mind. Turns out that they had screwed up data transmission to the 401(k) administrator, resulting in a number of double contributions (which I missed). While they were screwing that up, they also failed to make one of our actual contributions (which wasn't visible to me, since one of the 'extra' ones showed up on that date). When they rolled back the errant contributions, we were left one short due to the missed contribution.

1ib2k8p,personalfinance,Any point in paying off a 83 year old's debt?,"So my 83 year old great aunt has recently contacted the family distraught because she has dug herself into a hole of no return. She has 79k of credit card debt ranging from 20-30% interest as well as a timeshare that she stopped paying a few years ago that now shows as 23k delinquent debt on her credit score.

She owns her house outright but turns out shes a hoarder so its is totally trashed and full of black mold, so we might get 50k for it from a flipper if we are lucky. And even then she would need place to live.

She does get around 6k a month from a combination of her pension and social security, so theoretically if she was debtless she would be doing fine.

My moms idea was too get a big loan against home equity but she got turned down for a sight unseen HELOC loan (probably because of her delinquent timeshare payments) and also to borrow against a life insurance policy she had but that only yielded 44k which we think she will need to find a new place.

The family is trying to think of all these creative ways to pay down her credit cards including her deeding the house into someone with good credit's name in order to get the HELOC and then pay off her debt and fix up the house a well as use her pension to pay off the heloc at 8% instead of the CC at 25% average.

But the thought I had today is why? Why pay the debt at all? At 83 years old shouldn't she be able to either declare bankruptcy or ignore the debt until she dies? Its not like she needs credit for the rest of her life.

If she stops paying on everything, she makes more than enough to live comfortably, she just wont be able to get any new credit cards. If she deeded the house to someone else they could get the heloc loan to actually fix the house and she could pay it off with her monthly income to keep living there, because she really doesnt want to move. If she REALLY needed credit, then someone in the family could take care of her.

Am I missing something here? What would be the point of trying to wrangle that amount of debt at that age? Isnt the play to just ignore it? Paying it off for someone who will realistically die in the next ten years (her heath is terrible and she won't go to the doctor) seems like a big waste of resources.

1hmi4ye,personalfinance,Funded 529 and daughter just inherited a trust fund ,"
I’ve funded my daughter’s 529 plan, likely overfunded for where she will go to college.  So was comfortable coming into her last half of senior year.  

Then, very quickly over the course of just a few months I lost a cousin to cancer.  She was never married and had just retired from her job of 30+ years.  Unbelievably kind person who saw my daughter like a niece and always remembered her birthday.  

Upon her passing I was informed she left a very specific trust for my daughter documented clearly to be used for education.  I have not seen the details yet as it needs to go through probate process.  But it’s to be funded at $200k. 

Never imagined any of this.  So my question is, how do I best manage getting the money out of the 529 to not pay taxes on it?  Pay tuition from trust and reimburse myself from the 529?  

Know I can put $35k in a Roth for her from 529 once she graduates.  But what do I do to get the rest out in light of the trust?

1k435n3,personalfinance,is Primerica a Pyramid Scheme,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently a senior in college preparing for graduation, and I recently accepted a position with Primerica as a Financial Coach. Initially, I was excited about the opportunity. It was presented as a way to help people improve their financial literacy while gaining valuable experience in the finance industry.

However, after doing more research, I’ve found a lot of mixed reviews about the company, particularly concerns that it operates like a pyramid scheme. Many sources suggest that Primerica’s business model relies heavily on recruiting new agents rather than focusing solely on selling financial products. Some claim that most of the income comes from building a team and earning overrides on their sales, instead of direct client work.

I’ve only been to the office once, and everyone I met seemed genuine and welcoming. The environment was positive, and I heard several personal success stories from representatives who have been with the company for a while. From what I observed, there does seem to be potential for growth, especially for individuals who are self-driven and comfortable in sales and leadership roles.

That said, I’m feeling unsure. I value my time and want to make sure I’m investing it into something ethical, sustainable, and aligned with my long-term career goals. I’m concerned about the commission-only structure, the lack of benefits, and the pressure to recruit within my personal network. While this isn’t my only job at the moment, I am looking for something stable that I can grow with after graduation, and I’m not sure if this is the right fit. I’m still open to giving it a shot to gain firsthand experience, but I want to go in with realistic expectations.

I’m reaching out to ask: has anyone here worked with Primerica or had direct experience with the company? Is it something worth pursuing as a new graduate, or should I be cautious? I also have a meeting with my Regional VP tomorrow and would appreciate any suggestions for questions I should ask to better understand whether this opportunity is truly right for me.

Edit: I can’t respond to all of the comments that were made under this thread but I just want to say thank you for reading my post and I genuinely do appreciate all the feedback!",715,0.94,715,0,764.0,49.0,450,1745203227.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1k435n3/is_primerica_a_pyramid_scheme/,False,True
1ok4kqb,personalfinance,I'm super concerned about our future,"EDIT: To add more context, Husband is still working and drawing SS. He decided to start drawing because he'd break even if he waited until full retirement age. Our calculations say we will net enough money to buy a house outright in a new lower cost of living area. Husband can continue similar work there and substitute with DoorDash, etc. He can also work as much as he wants but it is true that in income will max out at a low rate. BUT in reality he can work as much and earn as much as he wants but he does have a lot of injuries so may be limited. I plan on working until at least 67, and in the roles that I qualify for will pay for health insurance for both until he can get Medicare at 65 which should not be that much. We can both continue to save approximately $8000 a year this way we have planned for major repairs, emergency. We are grateful for what we do have, humble and hopeful. I think we will be ok even if we have to become expats. Thank you for all the very helpful advice. 

I'm 58 and had to quit my job this year due to health issues. I'm starting a new job that I don't have high hopes for. My husband is 62 and just retired, and is still working part-time. His SS is less than $1300. He has no retirement whatsoever, but has some money in savings from an inheritance of about 30k. I hardly have any retirement either, and if my health issues continue, I may end up on disability, which would only be $1400 per month. I am receiving a 30k settlement myself by the end of the year, hopefully it will be that amount. I plan to max out an existing HSA with some of that and make sure that there is enough to cover the BK payments in savings in case this new job doesn't workout. (I suffer from PTSD). Our only expenses right now are the mortgage and it is less than $1000 per month, and a chapter 13 BK payment of $750. The BK payment will be paid off by this time next year. We have plans to sell the house which we owe $100k on buy another smaller home and get rid of the mortgage. My husband seems to think we can live out our lives on this small amount of income as long as we have no debt but I don't think he considers future medical expenses, which tend to plague us all. Plus, houses need maintenance. Thinking about our future leaves me feeling pretty depressed. I feel like he is just disillusioned. We owned a business for about 10 years and had to sell at a loss. That's mostly how we got in this mess.

1klvte4,personalfinance,My mother took my 700+ credit to a 580. What should I do?,"I, 25M, am now really good with credit and understand it well and also typically am very good with my money for the most part. I have anywhere between 0%-5% credit card debt, never missed a car payment, any other lines of credit I had I always paid them on time. 

My mother, 52, is by far the worst with money I’ve ever seen and I didn’t learn about this until just recently. When I was 18-19, when I had no credit, my mom convinced me to co-sign on a car to “help kickstart my credit” which made complete sense to me at the time. She’s had the same car, and it’s now been repo’d TWICE! First time, I had to pay $2,200 to get it caught up on and released from the tow yard before it went to auction. Now I just let them have it cause I can’t deal with it anymore. 

To makes matters worse, she calls me and tells me that she got a Ninja Air Fryer from Rent-A-Center…WHILE SHES 3 MONTHS BEHIND ON HER CAR! 

Idk what to do. I hate that I’m making sure that I am paying off my cards right before the statement date, making all my payments on time and being responsible and having spreadsheets while she thinks it’s a game. My gf and I want to start a family and buy a house but having a below 600 score is gonna hard doing that. 

Essentially, what can I do? Should I get a credit lawyer? Should I just wait it out? Thank you.

1o5scfn,personalfinance,A look at the cost of a pet emergency. Emergency savings can make or break how you feel about your pet's final hours. (TW: trauma dump?),"My cat got sick on September 30. Actually, it probably started on September 19 when we thought she had a little kitty cold, but she bounced back after two days of low energy. On 9/30 we took her to the vet because her energy was low again, and she was sleeping in odd places of the house, facing the walls, usually in a corner or under some furniture. Reminescent of when she had her last UTI, which was pretty severe.

Anyways, take her to the vet. Cha-ching, $336 for a blood test to find out what's going on.

Blood test results come in the next day 10/1, indicating Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease and a massive liver infection. She had early markers of Stage 1 KCD back in January, so this is rapid progression. They recommend scheduling an ultrasound to see what's going on with her liver. Subcutaneous fluids for the dehydration, injectable antibiotic, and some antibiotic tablets to take home, cha-ching, $138.66.

Take her back for the ultrasound 10/3, they notice some fluid in her abdomen. That's not good. Gotta know what that is, diagnostically this is the most likely thing to tell us what's actually going on. But they can't schedule that today, they only have two vets and they're slammed. So they do the ultrasound and more subq fluids, cha-ching $616.

Weekend was rough. Cat isn't eating. Run out to get the GOOD wet food for her to try to keep her hydrated and interested. Hand feeding my cat wet slop from a bowl. Cha-ching, $36 in various wet foods and treats.

Make it to Monday 10/6 and take her in for abdominocentesis. Fluid has gone down a little bit, but she's still not doing great with hydration. I mention to the vet that she's not been eating, they give encouragement and say just get her to take whatever calories possible. Mild sedative for the abdominocentesis, fluid analysis, ultrasound guided fine needle aspirate, and more subq fluids. Cha-ching $825.

She's not doing well and we're waiting for the fluid analysis results. Call up the vet and tell them I'm **really** concerned she hasn't been taking in more calories, aren't we worried about hepatic lipidosis at this point? Could she have uremic ulcers since she's acting like the food bothers her mouth or is it nausea? They prescribe something at my inisisitence. Buprenorphine for any pain, an appetite stimulant gel, and one can of complete nutrition food. Cha-ching, $91.70.

Now I'm hand feeding my cat overnight and sobbing while I do it. I call another vet to get an appointment in the morning to get a second opinion. Take her in on the morning of 10/9. They want to do their own blood test, and fluid draw to see if composition is visibly different from the one the other vet performed, want to perform their own ultrasound to look at her liver, and they hear a heart murmur. I don't care what you need to do, just help my little baby.

At 1:00 PM they call me and tell me they're waiting for the abdominal fluid to spin down but they think if we keep her on appetite stimulants and increase her food intake over the next week while waiting for antibiotics to work she can recover. But she does have fluid around her heart that will need to be addressed, but it's not an insane amount right now and let's not make her more uncomfortable by drawing that out, too. But will we let them do a chest xray? Sure, go ahead. I'll come in and get her while you do that.

Arrive at the vet at 1:50 PM and things have changed. The fluid in her abdomen is almost entirely urine; her bladder has a rupture. From the xray they can see that one lung is floating in fluid as well. There's nothing that can be done. She's going to be in pain and the bladder can't be fixed. It's time to make the hardest decision a pet owner can make. They don't even charge me for the blood draw that they sent off for analysis or for some other small things. Radiograph, ultrasound, abdominocentesis, butorphanol, urinalysis, and urgent care base rate, cha-ching, $578.

Take her home. I'll spare you the details of the how the evening went, but we mentally prepare for the next day. Set the euthanasia appointment. We want her pain gone, and we want a clay cast of her paw print. Morning of 10/10 we pay another $276.

**Grand total for this pet emergency of just about $3000.** It only took 9 days to rack up, and we didn't even get to the point of trying any life-saving surgeries or treatments, not that I was going to let my pet go through cancer therapy if it was lymphoma or have a feeding tube in her.

So this is a long-winded way to say, if you have a pet, and you love and care about them, please realize how important an appropriate emergency savings is for their care. In the end, we couldn't do anything to help her, and knowing what we had gone through to find out made it just a little easier to make that difficult decision at the end. So set aside the money, and set it aside separate from you ""if I lose my job"" emergency savings. You never know when you might need it.

Oh, and we got that abdominal fluid analysis back the afternoon of 10/10. Inconclusive, low cellularity, primary candidate for transudate fluid is heart failure. Nothing that could have been done.",709,0.91,709,0,787.0,78.0,197,1760381041.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1o5scfn/a_look_at_the_cost_of_a_pet_emergency_emergency/,False,True
1jebgc1,personalfinance,"Credit union got bought out, but sent me the Title and letter stating vehicle is paid off with no lien on title even though I still owe. What should I do?","The credit union we have our auto loan through recently got bought out by another company, and over the course of the last few months have been notifying us of the next steps, login information, and resources to aid with the transition to the new company. The transfer of accounts and use of the new system went into full effect March 1st. When we log in to view our accounts with the new system, they show all the same accounts that existed with the previous company; mainly an unused savings account, checking account, and credit card with $0 balance. The only active account we regularly used was for an auto loan we took for my truck about 2.5 years ago. 
Last night, we got a letter addressed from the previous credit union. Inside it was the title to my truck, and a letter stating “Congratulations on paying off your auto loan!” There is no lien indicated on the title, and the back has the transfer to me from the credit union stating it’s been paid in full and owned by me. 
I don’t know what to do now. Part of me says “Yes! No more payments!”. But another part of me is saying to do the brutally honest thing and send the title to the new credit union and keep paying on my loan. 
Other possibly relevant information…
The entire loan amount was for about $16k, and I only owed about $7k before the transfer/buyout. Both the old and new credit union are out of state from us out west. We now live in Texas.  
Any advice would be most welcomed. Thank you!

Edit: This was all great advice and appreciate the input! I think this falls into the category of an unsecured loan now and will still make the payments like normal to avoid any hassle or hit to my credit. Just not going to tell them I have the title.

I kind of want to quit and maybe find another job, or maybe just take the summer off and reassess, or finally follow my dreams.

Here's the thing -- my whole life I've sought financial security and have never been unemployed. I have always wanted to do creative things like writing or being an entrepreneur but I stuck to the salary + benefits jobs because I wasn't willing to take the risk.

So now here I am, I have $1.55M invested between retirement and brokerage accounts, and about $90K in cash. My job pays \~185K/year and my wife makes about $95K. As of a few months ago, my plan was to work until I had $2.5M, and then retire. My expenses are around 50-60K/year so that seems like a pretty comfortable buffer.

BUT, we might be heading into the worst economy in a long time. The markets are all over the place and I don't think the 6-8% return assumption is going to apply in the near term. We might see runaway inflation. And while in normal times I'd be confident of getting a new job if I needed one, now I'd be competing with dozens of other ex-government employees with the same set of skills and we might be heading into a recession.

I lived in LA, but this month I moved in with some cousins who are well off further south to not worry about rent. 

The industry I was a part of crumbled and I’ve been unemployed since September. I switched to doing work that I used to do via social media,  but have only been freelancing with nothing super substantial. I JUST got a freelance editing gig that will land me roughly 2000 per month, but given my unemployment gives me about 1600 after taxes, I’m really not making a dent. 

I’m about 37k in debt from student loans (degree that’s basically useless) and two credit cards. 

Last night I almost got towed. I stopped him before he could do it, but because the car was already hooked, apparently I had to pay a drop fee or they were going to take the car and charge double or more. It was $300. I know that doesn’t seem like much, but it was more than I had. I tried to pay through my credit cards but I haven’t been able to pay this month so they got declined. I had to call a friend to ask him to venmo until I get paid on Monday. It was humiliating. I don’t want to be in a position where $300 sends me off the edge. I literally snapped at the driver which is something I don’t think I’ve ever done to anyone.

My teacher finds it annoying and says it distracts ADHD students, so he’s planning to have the principal pull me out of class and call my parents every time it happens.

I can’t control when my blood sugar drops, and the beeping is a built-in safety feature. It’s not like I’m ignoring it—it just alerts me so I can take care of my health. This feels unfair and like I’m being punished for a medical condition.

1hywodk,legaladvice,I witnessed a judge terrorize an entire courtroom,"Yesterday I went to the courthouse to support my husband in a legal matter and left absolutely horrified by what I witnessed. 

The judge himself walked in late to the courtroom and immediately started making a statement to the effect of, I was here until 9:00 PM last night doing paperwork because you attorneys are loading up my docket before launching into a verbal attack on a random attorney. He ended his tirade along the lines of things are going to move quickly so no funny business and he doesn't want a repeat of the night before.

Okay, that's fine. At that point I thought he was just rightfully irritated and overworked while trying to make sure things go smoothly that day. I could not have been more wrong.

The judge was a machine making his way through all the cases with an attorney then proceeded to berate, threaten and patronize everyone without. His disgust with having to interact with any kind of novice was on full display and the reactions of the court officers and attorneys suggested to me this was a common occurrence.

The single most appalling thing I witnessed was a woman who appeared to have a devastating medical condition. By the time she was called, it was very apparent the stress of the situation was exasperating her condition and left her struggling to speak. Her husband (and I assume caretaker) attempted to speak for her and was immediately attacked and threatened with jail. It was all so completely unnecessary and devoid of a single ounce of humanity.

I witnessed more people with positive case outcomes leave a courtroom lividly angry than I ever thought possible. It is my sincere opinion that this judge's misconduct goes beyond the hostile courtroom his own actions created. I truly believe he is actively engaging in discrimination. 

Aside from filing a judicial misconduct complaint, is there anything more I can do legally to address this judge's behavior?

So I thought, why not marry her and let her have them? It's essentially free tens-of-thousands a year.

I just turned 18 about a month ago and at one of our family friend’s barbecues my mom struck up conversation with the host’s brother’s wife about my coming of age. She told my mom about something she did when her daughter came of age, where they got these “Mama Bear Legal” papers notarized and it gave her the ability to make decisions if her daughter was medically incapacitated. This didn’t sound too bad at first, and I wasn’t against it since I don’t have a bad relationship with my mom and I trust her to make medical decisions in an emergency. However, my mom gave me a folder and told me to get it notarized today without even expecting me to read it, but before I went to go sign it, I flipped through it, and it looks like it gives her the rights to WAY more things. I called her and asked what it was, and she swears it only has to do with medical decisions if I’m incapacitated, yet I’m seeing sections about my educational records, finances, etc. My mom is now upset with me for not wanting to sign it right away. Does anyone know anything about this company and what the papers do? I’m admittedly a little clueless when it comes to things like this (to be fair, I just turned 18) but I just don’t want to sign my right to my own finances and information away.

1j3mw7o,legaladvice,"I was falsely accused, proven innocent, I want to take it further.","During September 2024 I stayed over a female friend’s house and 2 days later I was arrested under suspicion of criminal damage.

I was invited over because her parents were on holiday, I stayed one night, nothing weird happened at all and I went work in the morning the next day.
2 days later I’m arrested by 4 police officers around midday, taken out of my bedroom of my house for my entire family to witness. My possessions are taken, my watch, my phone, my air-pods, my car keys, my wallet. I’m also handcuffed and put in the back of a police car.

I’m then taken to the police station where I finally find out I have been accused of “ejaculating” on multiple items of this girls property.
I’m relieved when I hear this because I know I haven’t done this after spending over an hour stressed thinking I’ve damaged someone’s property without realising.

I’m then kept in a cell for 10 hours before being questioned, some of the questions were outrageous like this girl had set me up and lied to the police officers as she’d been questioned before me. I was told she said that I forcefully invited myself to stay over her house, and I forcefully stayed in her bed with her. She told me to sleep in her bed on the wall side and never offered an alternative.
I also found out the items I had apparently ejaculated on were her pillows, bed sheets, duvet, 2 stuffed toys, a pair of her underwear and her parents bedsheets?? Like what?!?
These items were taken in for forensics.

After being questioned and all procedures were done and I was released on bail and let to go home but they kept my watch and my phone for investigation.
While this investigation was ongoing it felt like this girl and her best friend made it their life mission to ruin my life. Every single mutual friend of ours knew every detail about this investigation, and I was portrayed as guilty because that’s what those girls were telling people. My friends that they didn’t even know were also messaged by these girls telling them all about it. People I didn’t even know existed thought that I had done what they claimed I did.
I’ve seen countless messages, voice notes, snapchats and calls from these girls to my friends saying so much shit about me and the investigation. They even laughed about me getting arrested which makes me think they didn’t take it seriously and that they set me up.
I’ve had people message me about it, threaten me, I’ve been blocked by a few friends, some other people won’t associate with me anymore, I’ve even been physically shoved in a pub by another one of their close friends unprovoked.
I’ve kept all evidence of them sending my friends messages, voice notes, photos, everything incase there was something I can do with them.

Today I found out that forensics came back and there was no trace of semen, no trace of my DNA anywhere. The police said that my bail has been dropped, the investigation has been dropped and there will be no further action against me.

I was put through so much shit, I went through so much stress, lost so many friends. I became severely depressed because of this. I’m now on anti-depressants, I have therapy, I hardly leave my house anymore because I’m nervous to see those girls or the people that believe this about me.

This doesn’t feel just to me. I want to take this further. I want to press charges. I was falsely accused of doing something awful and I went through an insane amount of defamation. I want compensation for this.

I don’t really know what to do next, can I even take this further or will it get pushed aside? I’m hoping somebody on here can give me advice and help me out with this.

1ng20el,legaladvice,Bridal hair and makeup artist cancelled cancelled less than 24 hours due to “emergency surgery”. I found out through social media she lied and did another bride’s makeup on my day. Can I get my money back?,"Location: NJ/NY 

Hello - seeking legal advice to get my money back from my bridal hair and makeup artist. 

I contracted the artist back in March of this year to do my hair and makeup for my September wedding, in addition to services for my family and bridesmaids. I have a signed contract from this. 

In April, my HMU artist called me asking for details about the wedding timeline, which I thought was odd so far in advance. I asked if there was any issue with my booking to which she said no. I have screenshot evidence of this. 

2 weeks before the wedding, the artist was paid in full per the contract. 

Fast forward to 12 PM the day before my wedding, she cancelled on me saying she had an emergency surgery and was put on bed rest. She was sending a replacement artist, however this artist was not at her caliber (he was meant for bridesmaids) meaning that I was getting a service that was below the premium rate I paid for. When I tried calling her to mention I needed a special bridal artist as a replacement, the artist screamed on the phone at me saying I was showing attitude and she needed bed rest. I also have video evidence of this. 

This week, I found the artist tagged in a wedding post for a bride that had the same wedding date as me. I messaged the bride and she confirmed this artist was in fact on site and did her makeup, despite her telling me she was on bed rest. 

Is this something I can get my money back for? All in all I paid about $2.5K to this artist for myself and family/bridesmaid services. While she did send a replacement artist, ultimately she lied about her availability and sent someone below the rate I paid for.

1kr6ngy,legaladvice,Won $1.5M judgement 28 years ago and just found out yesterday,"Location: Bronx NY.
Sounds almost unreal. Yesterday while searching the Bronx county court records for my father in a separate matter we found record of a workers comp case filed on his behalf in 97’. Back in 96’ my father had been in a factory accident where he worked and it cost him 3 of his fingers. The case file that I read last night argued that the machinery was known to be defective and the court agreed granting my father a $1.5M judgement. The issue is my father had no idea that this lawsuit was even filed. He sat for disposition according the case file but the company he worked at made him believe that nothing was going to come from it so he let it go. At the time we were recently immigrated and my father spoke zero English. Once the company told him that and after over a year of physical therapy we moved and changed phone numbers. Which is what I assume prevented the lawyer from finding us though I question how that’s possible. 

Long story short… my sisters and I are hoping to be able to collect this money for him as he’s nearing retirement age and this would help set him up to remain independent. 
1.) What are our options? Who do we contact to try and collect on this judgement assuming it was even paid out. The attorney on record has moved on to different industry and I don’t think the firm is active anymore. 
2.) How does something like this slip past the crack? It feels to me like things weren’t handled correctly and I want to make sure he is compensated appropriately as our lives could have been much different had he received this money. Not sure why he “couldn’t be found”. We share the same name and I can tell you it is unique. We were also on permanent resident visas so it’s not like we were hiding in this country and couldn’t be tracked. Paid taxes every year. Became citizens in 2004. Seems to me like a lot of avenues to be found through, just not a lot of effort on the part of whomever was looking.

The family came by today and told her they are suing her because he died there and she didn’t call anyone. Even though cops have asked her not to call them for homeless people unless they are violent or messing with their business.
This seems like such a frivolous lawsuit and told her she should counter sue for waste of time.
Does she need to worry? Or is she going to need to pay up?

Thank you all for the advice she has contacted her business liability insurance and asked her to say nothing but refer them to them and they will handle it.

Pretty straightforward situation. My neighbor paid to get his driveway repaved but when I got home, my driveway was paved instead of his.

We never ordered it, never signed anything, never even knew who they were until we came home to a paved driveway and my neighbor being super pissed. 

I’m in the clear right? They don’t have any quotes, visits or anything at all from us because obviously, we never reached out to them to have the work done. Can we just let it go? We’re afraid if we reach out, they’ll just try to exploit the situation further. Should I get a lawyer?

1jqr4ti,legaladvice,"Daughter tripped on a laptop at school, school wants her to pay for it","Location: Arizona, USA

  
Hi folks,

My 18 year old daughter goes to a highschool that does everything on chromebooks that the school provides.  They are responsible for any damages to their own chromebooks unless they purchase insurance.  

Last week at school one of her classmates forgot to charge his chromebook, so he had to charge it during class.  The school doesn't provide power at the desks or batteries to charge with, so he had it strung across the aisle between desks to charge.

My daughter got up to go to the bathroom and didn't see the cable and tripped on it.  She fell on her face and the classmate's chrome book also fell off the desk and was irreparably damaged and he didn't have insurance on it.

Her school is telling her that she has to pay for the chromebook or else she won't be able to go to prom or graduate.  It seems completely unreasonable that we should have to pay because her classmate created a tripping hazard and that the school allowed that to happen by not providing a safe way for students to charge their chromebooks.

  
We aren't looking for any compensation for her falling, but we don't want to have to pay for the laptop (we can afford to pay for it, but its the principle of the thing).  Is there a way to get them to back off on this?  They wont return my calls about this and are adamant (when she goes to the office) that she has to pay for it.  Holding her prom and graduation over her head also feels like extortion.

EDIT: Well, I’m really proud of her right now. She escalated this by her self with no input from me.  She’s been trying to work with the tech staff since the incident and go through the proper channels. She realized that wasn’t going to be effective and she went to see the principal today right when I was posting this 😂. He waived the damage charges and said it wasn’t her fault.",8460,0.98,8460,0,8636.0,176.0,253,1743707155.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jqr4ti/daughter_tripped_on_a_laptop_at_school_school/,False,True

As tears flowed from my eyes I realized that 6 years ago when I my husband and I was having a rough patch, he secretly somehow had me served and the court granted him the divorce since they could not reach me. There is one big problem. Him and I have been together for 22 years and living together for 14. How is it possible that I never saw this paperwork nor did I know that I was divorced!!! When I confronted him he admitted to it. I haven’t spoken to him since. That’s how my 2025 kicked off. Any advice is appreciated….💔

1mrjha6,legaladvice,Bullies parents want a meeting after I recorded their child.,"Location: Arizona

Apologies if this is the wrong flair.  I have temporary custody of my 13 year old niece. School started in July where we are and almost immediately upon starting my niece has had an issue with another girl bullying her.

I’ve complained many many many times, I’ve met with the principal/counselor, I’ve sent emails, basically everything short of contacting the police because I figured it’d be for nothing if I don’t have anything but my nieces word against the girl’s. The school kept telling me they’ll look into it. I’ve tried getting a meeting set up with the girls parents a few times through the school but no luck. 


Thursday my niece came to me crying and showed me her ipad with a bunch of screenshots of nasty messages. She said she joined a friend on a game and there were a couple other kids from the school, including the girl bullying her. We rejoined the game to see if the girl was still there and she was. When we joined the bully turned her voice chat on and was saying horrible things to/about my niece. I took my phone out and recorded her for a bit and then turned my nieces voice chat on. All I said was that I’m (niece’s name) uncle, I know she’s been harassing my niece for weeks, that I had recorded proof and screenshots and to stop or I’ll report it to the police. She said “Ok” and left the game. 

The next day (yesterday) my niece stayed home from school and later I got a call from the school saying that the girls parents “expressed concerns about an interaction” between me and the girl want to set up a meeting. I agreed but asked for everything in writing 


Should I bring legal counsel to the meeting? Should I file a report before the meeting?

Context: I got laid off (as an IT Manager) by the last company I worked for, unexpectedly. However a week or so prior to layoff they asked me to ensure all passwords be documented. As such I used 1Password and “trained” the GM at that time how to use it, per their request.

Come to find out, they also laid off that manager sometime after me. There have been attempts from my employer to reach out to me via WhatsApp. I just ignored them. They should have the passwords, as to why they do not know about them? Negligence. I feel that I have moved on, I feel that I do not owe them anything. Not a good company to work at, I felt used there.

For all they know, I forgot the password. I denied a severance from them for a reason. Their conditions at the time were that if I accept this severance I continue to provide them up to a certain amount of technical support via email or phone call. I denied that however, written and signed. I took my own copy as well.

Here is the text message the employer sent me: “Hi,
I’ve reached out regarding the PIN/password for the company computer you were using. This device is company property, and I need access to it immediately to continue business operations.

If I do not receive the PIN, I will be forced to proceed with a formal legal request to recover access.

I’m asking for your cooperation to avoid unnecessary escalation.

Thank you”

Anyway, this message feels like a soft threat of sorts? Perhaps not. Any advice?

Having a 'little' integrity, trying to set a good example for my kids, and knowing we were on camera and it was my girlfriend's car license plate they would have read, I called in to the manager to report it. 

I asked if they had insurance to cover something like this, knowing full well they did. The manager lied and said no, and proceeded to send me the auto body bill for $1500, which states that it was paid by insurance. 

If insurance paid for it, wouldn't it be the insurance company that would be coming after me? I feel like they're just trying to squeeze me for $1500, and then the insurance company will do the same. At this price it'd be small claims,  so should i even worry about getting a lawyer?  They only have my first name and phone number.

1mhdzpa,legaladvice,Reported my boss last week to OSHA and got fired shortly after.,"Location: Dalton, Ga

Exactly one week ago today on the 28th of July, I made a phone call to OSHA regarding my boss. The claim I made was valid, per the OSHA investigator I had on the line and my boss got a phone call from OSHA that same day. My boss was on vacation that day and when he got back this weekend, he fired me yesterday on Sunday, making very vague claims about tasks I hadn't completed. I had in fact completed all of them because he gave me a very specific list. I even asked him for clarification about the tasks I hadn't completed and he read the message and didn't respond. I just want to know what I should do now? Thank you!

EDIT- I just got off the phone with a regional whistle-blower complaint investigator and he determined that he isn't making the complaint due to the fact that I had made a few mistakes in my first 90 days of employment that my boss did quote me as some reasons as to why he did let me go (He did send me an updated text a few hours ago detailing specific reasons as to why he fired me, he was wrong about multiple ones but right about some and the ""right about some"" is where the issue is). So going that route is null and void. 
Look, at the end of the day I just want my previous boss held accountable for 2 (have been investigated and confirmed) or 3 (the third is under investigation right now) individual OSHA violations which I already have individual case numbers for. 
I am going to take accountability for the mistakes I made and why he fired me.

One year ago I was out with a “friend” we had gone out for drinks and were over served. We got into a single motor vehicle collision and hit a stone pillar. Why? How? She was drunk and on her phone, when we looked up it was to late. I had taken the entire hit. 
The airbag through my head back after whiplash and overstretched my neck, overstretching my nerve and breaking my neck leaving paralyzed only being able to shrug my shoulders.
-Did she call 911? No, she called her brother. 
-Then did she call 911? No, she waited for her brother to get there. 
-Then did they call 911? no they proceeded to track me out of the car paralyzed with a broken neck, even tho i informed them that i couldn’t move.

Approximate time taken to call 911: 45 min

On the 911 call: We can hear brother 1, driver, me, and anonymous girl. 
Brother 1 leaves us gets in his car and drives off somewhere with 911 operator on the line, but hes on another call on another phone w/ someone else giving them directions to crash site. 
Brother 1 returns to crash site. Operator asks him to come back to us. You can hear me, driver and anonymous girl. 
You can hear ambulance in background approaching, Brother 2 shows up yelling at them to “get outa here”. Brother 1 says hes going to take the fault and say he was driving. Driver says no. Brother 1 yells at driver calling her a dumbass saying shes drunk. 

Sheriff and cops statement was useless: didn’t mention the number of people at the scene. 
Says the reason for crash is to avoid animal life. 
Cops didnt give driver breathalyzer test. Therefore no DUI. 
Cops mark driver down with same injuries as me..
Report mentions that Driver and I are transported to the hospital. But Driver never entered the hospital therefore no blood was taken to prove her alcohol level. 

Cops never got a statement from me.

1jl7l2m,legaladvice,Neighbor saw me naked through my window and called the police. Cannot stop thinking about it.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Location: Orange County, California. 

A few nights ago, late at night, I was doing laundry in my room and had my window open (it was a bit warm). I live on the fourth floor of my building and the window to my room is facing the street/neighborhood, but it’s quite high and you can only really see the ceiling from the street unless I’m standing right next to it. Anyways, I had my phone propped against my window screen so I could watch YouTube while folding some of my shirts (important later). I had a lot of clothes on the floor and at one point got up onto my bed to stop stepping on things and continued tending to my laundry there. I was so in the zone that I, very stupidly, took my clothes off so that I could throw those in the wash. When standing on my bed, I am likely visible from a high enough angle (like if someone in a higher apartment looked out their window). But I was on there for maybe a minute before throwing those in the wash and putting on fresh clothes. 

However, apparently one of my neighbors saw me do this from their window and recorded a video of me, then called the police. In one of the most embarrassing and frightening encounters I have had, they came to my door and asked if I have a window that faced that direction. I said yes, and they informed me that some of my neighbors had a concern about me being naked in front of the window and that I was recording people on my phone. I informed the officers that I was doing laundry and was watching videos on my phone, and profusely apologized - I also asked if the family would like me to to apologize directly, but they said “we should be good.” The officer also said “what you’re doing isn’t technically illegal, but…” and informed me to be more careful, noting that the family said their daughter had apparently seen me. The other officer also said “we aren’t here to get you in trouble.” I have no idea if they were telling the truth or just saying that. The encounter ended when they asked for my name, number, and if I had any previous citations. They told me to close my blinds and not do laundry on the bed (obviously), then left. I have not heard from anyone since, and this was on Sunday night (posting this on Thursday). 

My blinds have been pulled shut tightly since the incident, and I am deeply embarrassed. However, I can’t stop anxiously thinking about coming home to a charge or being arrested randomly for indecent exposure, which would ruin my life. I also feel gross about someone recording me naked in my home and calling the police on me… I get why they did that (if they felt they needed proof), but I feel extremely violated by that, even though I know I was being incredibly stupid and careless. I truly did not even think about my window being open. 

Anyways, should I consult a lawyer? Should I be concerned about a warrant being issued for my arrest? How likely is it that the police will charge me… does this sound like just a warning or the start of an investigation? Is there anything I can do about the video? I would prefer not to have someone I don’t know possessing a video of me naked. 

Thank you in advance. I literally cannot stop thinking about this and have anxiously googled any information I can 1,000 times. ",7400,0.92,7400,0,8105.0,705.0,94,1743091823.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jl7l2m/neighbor_saw_me_naked_through_my_window_and/,False,True
1k2dt72,legaladvice,Boss Canceled My Doctor’s Appointment Without My Consent – HIPAA Violation?,"I work as an administrative assistant at a hospital. After speaking with my primary care provider, I scheduled several follow-up tests related to ongoing health concerns. I notified my supervisor that I would be taking a day off to attend these appointments.

My supervisor is the director of my department and she has tried to tell our office that no one is allowed to request any Mondays or Fridays off for any reason. I already confirmed with HR that she cannot enforce this policy and it is especially not applicable to my role. 

I stood up for myself and told her she cannot tell me to cancel or change my medical appointments and we ended up in an argument with me getting emotional. Later that evening, she texted me to apologize and said she would like to meet with me in the office on Monday and look into reaching out to her “scheduling guru” to see if she could have appointment moved to a sooner date. I said I would be okay with this (meaning if we met in person and she reached out to her contact to see what could be done) I never really wanted to change my appointment but I felt intimidated into considering the idea. 


Then, without notifying me or obtaining my  explicit permission, my supervisor contacted the hospital’s scheduling department and canceled my medical appointment, rescheduling it for another date and time that did not work for me. I only found out later when the provider sent me a confirmation that the appointment had been cancelled and changed. This was done entirely without my consent, knowledge, or involvement. I had to call my provider’s office back and tell them I did not authorize these changes and they weren’t able to give me my original appointment back until I escalated things to the dept manager. 

I reported this to the hospital’s compliance officer, who initially said they would investigate. A couple of days later, I was told the matter was closed and that my supervisor would face no consequences. I also reported it to HR, but several of my colleagues and I have made many complaints to HR about her behavior over the past year and she never faces any consequences. 

My supervisor told them that I said I was “okay” with her making this change even though I clearly meant only if we were to meet in person and discuss options together. I have screenshots of the text messages, of my voicemails saying my appointment had been cancelled and moved. They never even asked me for any of these documents after I told them I had them all. They simply took her word over mine. 

I have since filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights citing potential violations of HIPAA. I’ve also requested a written email from the compliance officer explaining how they came to this finding during their “investigation.”

This is a pattern of behavior. My boss is very controlling and intimidating. She is always treating people like garbage and acts like she is allowed to do whatever she wants. And apparently, the hospital agrees. I feel so violated and like I have no options. It is awful knowing I still have to continue going in to work to face her. I’ve been trying to find another job but there are not many options with similar wages in my field. 

Do I have legal grounds for further action here? Could this also cross into other categories (e.g., employment retaliation, privacy violation)? I’d appreciate any advice on next steps.

I have been given advice to cash the check and put it aside. I am unsure what do. It feels so strange. Do I go into the bank and explain? Do I just hang on to the check? I'm sorry I'm coping by problem solving.

If it's important: There's no will. No power of attorney at this time. Our kids were his only dependents. 

Update: Kinda. I haven't fully decided what to do yet. There's a little bit of context here, though probably not entirely legally relevant. I live in California. 

I have pictures of the note with the check he left. In the note he clarifies the money is for the kids and I. He has very little debt, just a car loan for less than 10 grand. 

His children and I are about a month from being homeless, and this is something he knew. He does have the funds in his account and then some. I believe this is his portion of the house we sold. I believe his intention was to make sure our rent was paid for the next several months, as this was one of our biggest stressors.

I would love to get a lawyer, but at this point we were struggling to afford food and rent. It's clear we will need a lawyer to some degree, though he has no other dependents and his mom wants to make sure his kids and I are taken care of, so I don't imagine there will be much animosity. Can someone guide me how to proceed? Do we have to have a lawyer? Are there low cost options to this? I have informed the military of his death as he was a veteran. They didn't tell me they offered any legal services, just counseling and will help with his pension.

The trainer had a stallion on site down below in a fenced in stall. I bring my mare home a month later. Trainer contacts me asking how mares doing I say good. The mare is getting fatter but on a diet and being worked daily.
Trainer had happend to show up to my ranch and had looked at her and said wow she looks pregnant. I giggled and said she's on a diet and worked daily!
She said hopefully my stallion didn't get her pregnant when he got loose on the property and started laughing saying she's joking. I got very uncomfortable and when she left I had talked to other boarders at my barn and they said that's very odd she would say that as a joke. I called the trainer up and asked her if she was joking and she said her stallion did get out but she said the possibility of my mare being pregnant was less than 1%. Mind you this is 10 months after her being with the trainer on site and me not knowing a stallion was ever loose or close to my mare.I called the vet out and she did a rectal and said yup she's pregnant. I am at lost on how to go about it I told her she got my horse pregnant and she said that it wasn't her horse who bred to my mare and that she must have been pregnant before. 2 months later the baby is born and has to be rushed with mom to a hospital to get plasma transfer and other complications costing thousands. How do I go about this? Is there anything I can do?? Or cut my loses.

1i2803i,legaladvice,A professor told me his class wasn’t for me because of my disability,"I’m a senior at Texas A&amp;M. I’m one of very few students there who have a spinal cord injury and cannot use their hands to write. I can however, use either my computer or aid of someone else to write. With this in mind, here’s the story. 

On the first day of classes, I make sure that the professors know my abilities and what my disability entails so I can be properly accommodated. One class however, failed to accommodate me. This professor explained that he will be presenting quizzes at the end of each class. These quizzes are closed note, worth 30% of the class grade, and all on paper. I brought the professor to the side and described to him that I unfortunately am unable to write due to my disability and that I will need to be accommodated in order to succeed in his class. He proceeds to say “well this class might not be for you then”. I told him that in the past, when I was given paper quizzes that professors would allow me to take them home where I can complete them on my computer. He then described to me that he won’t let me do that because that then becomes unfair to others because the quizzes are closed note and the moment I take it out of the class, it then becomes open note. We couldn’t come up with a proper accommodation. 

I’m speaking with my disability advisor today but the thing that’s been stuck in my head was his sentence stating that his class isn’t for me due to my disability. Is this a violation of my rights?

My Brother passed away 4 years ago. Sherrifs with Hamilton County and the swat team showed up to my Dad's house to search for my deceased brother early today.

They didn't present a warrant and insisted on searching the house and property even though my Dad advised them that he had passed away 4 years ago.

Shouldn't they have known my brother had passed, and shouldn't they have had a warrant?

Any advise?

Update: I asked my Dad if he allowed them to search, and he did consent. He also never asked for a warrant. 
But he was also in a state of real shock. They had several vehicles and officers in his driveway and parked in front of his house.

He did ask why they were looking for him, and they said my brother had an outstanding arrest warrant. Seems extreme to me.

1jonblb,legaladvice,Wife mentioned child molestation from 20 years ago to therapist,"Location: California
My wife and I raised 3 children. Boy, girl, boy. Current ages 36, 34, 30. About 2 years ago we took our 2 younger children and their spouses on a trip. The oldest child is not on speaking terms with the family, so he was not on the trip.
The two adult children took this opportunity to let us know that they were both sexually molested by the oldest son when he was 13 and 14 years old. They did not want to talk about details or drudge up the past. Did not want authorities involved. They just thought that we, the parents should know what happened.
My wife and I were devastated. We had no idea. We respected the wishes of our children to leave it in the past. We haven’t talked about it since then. We have a wonderful relationship with both of them. The oldest son is completely out of the picture and nowhere near California.
Tonight my wife went to a therapist to talk about past traumas.  Nothing worth mentioning here, but she’s lived a fairly sheltered and safe life with normal life challenges. She thought talking to a therapist would help her learn new life skills and just become an all around better person.
When she mentioned the molestation incident, the therapist told her she was a designated reporter. She is going to report it to CPS.
My thought is that once you get a government agency involved in your life, you set a machine in motion that will only cause you heartache. There are no children involved. The oldest is completely out of the picture and the other two don’t want to talk about it. They are living amazing and successful lives.
My question is: what might CPS do? Should I try to track down my son and warn him? He’s not hard to find. He’s just not involved with the family. Will my wife and I be contacted by CPS?
*** EDIT ***
Thank you all so much for your collective wisdom.
My wife talked to her therapist today to ask about the reporting situation. The therapist informed her that from the information shared in the session, this is not reportable. She also said that CPS is all about protecting children and not getting involved in adult lives many years after the fact.
I’ve read all of the messages and appreciate all of the different perspectives.
One interesting note to point out - only a few seconds after I made my original post I was DM’d by a very concerned person offering legal help.

Shortly after I get an email from him expressing his frustration that I am working an extra job and offering his opinion that I should be relegated to an hourly pay if I have ""free time"" to work another job and that another certain employee can do more for the company than I. This of course was an accident and meant to go to my other boss. 

Now, what the fuck? Is this legal? The kicker is the employee he mentioned to take my place also has two jobs... lol.

1ix8uqt,legaladvice,12 year old arrested for making a joke about school shootings,"My 12 year old and his friend were joking in class and one-upping each other. ""I'll steal a car"" ""I'll rob a bank"", that kind of stupid stuff. They kept upping the ante until My son said ""I'll shoot at the school!"".

The school has a zero tolerance policy on talking about, joking, or obviously threatening school violence. The signed witness statement from the school does say that the boys were joking (obviously inappropriately) and he has zero access to any firearms.

He was expelled (reasonable), arrested, spent a night in Juvenile detention, and is being charged with a class 6 Felony (in Arizona).

I guess I'm just looking for feedback from someone with more experience with the legal system (because I have zero, I never got in trouble for anything). What are the odds that they are going to throw the book at him and set an example. I was told he could be facing being in Juvie until his 18th birthday! That seems crazy for 2 dumb kids saying dumb things.

I'm scared shitless that he will have a felony on his record and I will lose my son for the rest of his childhood over this.

My husband and I are expecting our first child in a couple weeks. His company has known about this, he just finalized his paternity leave (2 weeks paid) paperwork with his boss yesterday. Today that same boss called him into a zoom meeting with HR where he was laid off effective immediately. THANKFULLY I am on my own health insurance, he was told his would end the same day he was laid off. He was told several positions were being eliminated to cut costs, but no one else on his team was let go. No indication as to what those other positions were. 

They want him to sign a liability waiver in order to receive 3 weeks of SUB payments to supplement his unemployment (which is capped at $350ish a week where we live). The SUB payments are for 1 week per year of employment, so he'd qualify for 3 weeks. That's the only type of severance offered.

I am reeling. 

My wife (F27) and I (M28) have been renting this house for just under a year. We have a 3 year old son and 1 year old daughter, who just celebrated their birthdays a couple months ago. This is in Utah. 

Today during her checkup, we found out that she dangerously high lead levels in her blood. 

First, we swabbed her crib. Came back positive… then we tested it with water from a plastic bottle. Nothing. 

It’s the water. The TAP WATER. 

We have not been tested ourselves yet, but are all going to the doctor this week. 

Since moving into this house, my son has had behavioral problems akin to ADHD. My wife and I have had marriage problems and mood swings. My work performance has suffered. My hands and feet have been tingling. Our hair has been falling out. Both kids are smaller than would be expected. My wife’s periods are irregular. We have both had stomach pain and nausea. 

I expect we all have lead poisoning.

1hnsu79,legaladvice,Violated HIPAA by mistake as an RN,"I woke up this morning to a suspension following a HIPAA investigation, I had to go to HR today.

Awhile ago I was involving in two traumas that came into our ED, they were a pair who were involved in an MVC. Patient A was in stable condition and patient B was coding by the time they got to the ER. We had a code team working patient B and I was handling patient A with other nurse.... who while in the stabilization process told me, ""they're good, go help patient B."" I immediately responded back and foolishly said ""they're coding room 10,"" who was patient B. I never said any names.... but the patient A heard me and started crying....

I felt absolutely horrible and cannot believe I made such a dumb mistake saying that. But i was pulled onto HR who argued that this is a breach in HIPAA because patients *know* what ""coding"" is and that the patient could have known who room 10 was since they came in one minute apart.

They wanted me to write an official statement about it to submit to out HIPAA officer of the hospital but I told them I didn't feel comfortable doing thay today because I was ill... and I said I would do it monday. They then agreed and asked me if i had my badge with me, right before telling me I would be suspended until further notice.

1kxm9lu,legaladvice,Discovered 4 years after the fact that I purchased more land than anybody realized,"Location: Michigan.  I purchased 3 adjoining vacant commercial lots totaling 0.85 acres.  Bought them through the seller's real estate agent but paid for them via land contract directly with the seller.  That was 3.5 years ago.  Land contract terms have now been fulfilled as I have paid it in full.

In reviewing all my paperwork today, I have discovered something that somehow got overlooked by everybody at the time - and that is what the seller thought he was selling and I thought I was buying was actually only lots 1 and 2.  He did not intend to sell lot 3 which is an adjoining lot that he also owned and includes half of his pole barn.  I have verified this through plat maps, spoken to him about it, and he agrees with my assessment and does not know how such a mistake was made and didn't get caught by anybody (apparently even the city as they've been assessing me property taxes for all 3 lots and treating lot 3 as if it is vacant when it in fact is not).  I am going to end up getting a survey done before doing anything else.

The photos in the real estate listing only showed the vacant lots, but the acreage and highway frontage in the description included the extra lot (350 feet of highway frontage and 0.85 acres, with lot 3 comprising 50 feet and 0.13 acres of this).  Is a quitclaim deed the most straight-forward way to resolve this whereby I would simply sell him back lot 3 for the amount I've had to pay in taxes on it for the past 3-4 years?  I don't want any extra money for it as it was land I didn't think I was buying anyways, but I didn't know if there are other unforseen tax implications or other legal implications I'm not considering.

EDIT - thank you to everyone who responded.  Now when I go to speak to actual professionals about this, I stand a chance of actually knowing what I'm talking about and understanding their responses to me.",6107,0.98,6107,0,6234.0,127.0,182,1748451426.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1kxm9lu/discovered_4_years_after_the_fact_that_i/,False,True

I logged in and it did the usual two step authorization then I saw a number I don’t recognize. “Xxx-xxx-1236” I only ever had a number ending in “5874”(fake). I logged in and saw everything was completely empty. 401K completely gone. Starbucks stock plan completely empty. I was thinking maybe it was a glitch and opened and closed the app still empty. I called customer service and I asked them about the unknown number and they read it out loud to me and it was in the same zip code as I was and I looked it up on my messages and it was my SUPERVISORS NUMBER!! Mind you I haven’t worked with them in over 3 years and I have never even given them my social medias or anything except my phone number. I knew she was a trouble maker and she got fired eventually. I don’t know how she got ahold of my social security or even bypassed this stuff. If she actually emptied my accounts by somehow getting my social security from work, what can I do!???? 

note: I am getting deployed next month and worried I won’t have enough time for a lawyer. I have worked at Starbucks before I joined the army and left it 2 months before I went to basic. 

Tomorrow I am contacting fidelity since they are closed on weekends. Will update!!

1js6uql,legaladvice,Written up at work for my daughter's victim statement in police report,"Location: Colorado

Edit to add:  i would like to sincerely thank the numerous responses and advice.  I took a mental health day, declined the meeting, and spoke to a law office with a meeting set for later this week.  The union rep confirmed I made the right choice and still offered whatever support the union can, although it sounds as though this is even larger than what their legal team typically encounters or handles.  I truly appreciate the support! ❤️❤️❤️

I work at a public elementary school, which my daughter attended last year.  She reported inappropriate interactions by a male administrator, which I reported to the principal along with other concerning behaviors I had observed.  He is relatively new to the position, and has yet to prove his ability to be trusted, hold people accountable, or follow through on things.  His reaction to my concerns bothered me.  He argued that males are okay to use the children's restrooms, as they ""just need to run in real quick.""  I received little to no reassurance that this man would stay away from my child.

I then went and reported my daughter's situation and my expectations to other key staff, including the social worker and her teachers.  I needed to know she would be protected from him.  She was completely unnerved and creeped out by the way he interacted with her. I needed to know the other children would be protected from him. 

The remainder of the year, I watched him like a hawk.  He never again went near my daughter. 

About a year from this initial set of incidences, I receive a message from another mother (I've been here for 6 years, I have relationships with numerous families.)  They had contacted the police over what this man did to their daughter. Not knowing the full story, but knowing that i had issues with this man prior,, she informed the detective and he asked to speak to me and interview my daughter, which I agreed to.  Several other children, parents, and staff were interviewed as part of the investigation. 

The case is closed/active and he was removed from the position, yet not officially terminated.  The principal and his direct supervisor received a copy of the police report from the head of security, and unleashed absolutely anger in my direction.

I've been asked to ""debrief"" numerous times, where I get cornered alone and am told it's my fault for talking to the police and dramatic emphasis on the word ""allegedly"" indicated my child lied.  I joined the union and got a rep so I no longer have to have closed door meetings without a witness on my side to hear this crazy shit.

2 months ago, I was informed I was receiving a write up for breach of confidentiality based on the contents of the police report.  When I attended the meeting with the HR rep and principal to receive the write up, I lost my mind.

They quoted pieces of my daughter's victim statement in the write up!  I stopped the meeting to explain this was entirely unacceptable.  The principal got aggravated and spouted more insane bs. I told him this was no longer a discussion and I was signing to note that I was receiving this bs write up, but that I would follow district policy with a formal rebuttal within the given 10 day period.  

I did write a quite aggressive rebuttal, quoting board policy, social contacts, and the state law.  The union rep reviewed it and found it to be assertive but appropriate.  No one responded to my rebuttal and my call for higher level of accountability, fair application of policies, and refrain from retaliation.

Because they chose crickets, I chose to file a grievance with the district.  I finally received a call from someone in the superintendent office after almost 4 weeks following the filing of the grievance.  

He claims he is neutral.  He wants to meet to hear my side of this.  He won't allow my union rep to be present with me.  HR did not provide a copy of my rebuttal with the write up, even though it is district policy to always attach the rebuttal to the write up when it is requested.

What should I be doing here?  Colorado is one party so I could record our meeting.  Do I need to talk to a lawyer?  I feel like I'm walking into a trap.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  I am a mandatory reporter.  This man's actions were wildly inappropriate.  Why am I now the bad guy?  I also feel that they are dragging this out to simply not renew me as an easy way to get rid of me.  I need some advice please!

1les4mk,legaladvice,UPDATE: Deceased girlfriend’s mother threatening to sue me for equity in my home,"Location: Florida

First I would like to thank everyone who expressed their condolences to me regarding my girlfriend. It’s been a very difficult road since she has been gone.

Secondly, thank you to everyone who sent me advice and support for navigating this. 

I just want to tell my experience.

I ended up meeting with 3 different lawyers (2 free consultations and one paid). I went with all of the documentation I had and all 3 pretty much told me the same thing: unless they had something I didn’t, they did not see a case where her mother had any sort of claim to try to get anything from me. We even went over Cash app and Venmo transfers, and while she did send me money thru those, the money I sent to my girlfriend was more than what she sent me. 

The attorney that I paid for the consultation for offered to write a legal response to the letter on my behalf at no additional cost, but with the understanding that should she move forward with a lawsuit that I would have to begin making payments toward their service if I wanted to use them. I agreed to that, they allowed me to read their response and broke down the legal terms for me that I didn’t understand before sending it. I agreed and they sent it. This was yesterday morning.

Earlier this afternoon I got a phone call from the attorneys office stating that they had received a response. The attorney then got on the phone with me personally to let me know that the response they received from her attorney stated that she would not be pursue any further and to consider the matter closed. 

I know that my experience will not be typical of what may happen with others, but I wanted to make this update and again thank everyone for their support and their advice.",5823,0.99,5823,0,5882.0,59.0,1,1750279573.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1les4mk/update_deceased_girlfriends_mother_threatening_to/,False,True
1nzv2l9,legaladvice,Jeweler swapped my original Bvlgari necklace for a fake during repair — what can I do?,"
I took my original Bvlgari necklace to a local jeweler to fix a broken link. The repair only took about 15 minutes, but when they handed it back, I immediately noticed it wasn’t my original chain. I confronted them right away, but they accused me of lying and refused to discuss it further.

A week later, I went to an actual Bvlgari store, and they confirmed that the chain I have now is not original — it’s a lower-quality replacement.

I have the receipt from the repair, my proof of purchase from Bvlgari, and a written confirmation from the Bvlgari store that the chain is not authentic.

What can I do next? Should I contact the police, file a small claims case, or report them to a consumer protection agency? I just want my original necklace back or to be compensated for the loss. 

Location: Delray Florida

Edit: I did buy the whole necklace directly from Bvalgari. The original pendant was returned on a similar looking chain that was 10 centimeters longer and of lesser quality than the original. I did not take it to Bvalgari for repair because they do not have in house same day service. It has to be sent away for weeks and I wanted to wear it immediately.

      I finished spraying finish on an item and when I went to hang up my spray gun, I see a gun pointing directly at my chest.  The end of the gun was sticking through the crack of a partially opened door.  I can’t see who it belongs to as only the gun is visible.  I freeze for a second and assume somebody has broken into the building and I’m about to be shot/robbed.  I jumped back behind our spray booth to try to hide when the doors open and it’s three police officers screaming at me to put my hands up and direct me to move slowly to the wall.  I insisted that I work there (obviously. I’m wearing a respirator mask and covered in paint). They ask my name and if I have ID. They knew my last name as they’d already run my plates outside.  
        When things calm down, I ask if the alarm had gone off (maybe the other guys set the alarm forgetting I was still working) and the officer said yes that was the case.  He said the door was wide open and that’s how they got in.  They then left IMMEDIATELY without an apology and said to make sure the door was locked.  
          I was too shaken up in the moment but after they left I remembered that we’d removed our alarm system six days ago.  There is no alarm.

1kve74o,legaladvice,Wife Arrested for Shoplifting,"As the title says. However, something doesn’t seem right.. 

Location: Pennsylvania 

My wife was shopping at a local Giant. She uses the “scan it” app to scan things so she can just scan the app at self checkout at the end and pay. 

After paying today, she was grabbed for an audit, and they apparently found what they told her was a “large” discrepancy. She was prepared to pay the difference as she thought she had made a mistake but they told her they had to wait for a manager. Then the police showed up and arrested my wife and separated her from my 7 year old daughter. 

The arresting officer called me telling me I had to come get my daughter and that my wife was arrested for an aleged “$800 in retail theft.” I can’t even imagine what would be that much. 

When I went to the store to get my daughter, they allowed my to take the groceries that were paid for, but would not give me any information or any receipts “until court”, including a receipt for the food they let me keep. The arresting officer will also not let me see the receipt for the paid for food as it is for his evidence. 

My wife has honestly never done anything like this in her life, and I truthfully believe this is a mistake because I’ve always sent her any extra money we’ve needed for extra groceries. I feel like some sort of critical information is missing, or there is something wrong with the way the app scanned the food. I also feel like my wife offering to pay the difference should prove she didn’t have intent to steal anything. She was with my daughter and can easily be distracted by her in the store. 

When my wife got home, she looked over the groceries and told me what it looked like they had taken, (chicken, beef, energy drinks) and I cannot fathom how it would be “$800”. As the officer said, but I have no solid number because no one will give me a receipt. My daughter also adamantly agrees that “mommy scanned everything with the app”. 

They wouldn’t give my wife any chance to explain herself or explain anything to me. But I really don’t think my wife did anything wrong. 

Have mistakes like this ever happened? We’re going to speak to a lawyer on Tuesday but I can’t stop thinking something doesn’t add up here. 

EDIT: Thank you all. I understand why people are so quick to assume she did it, and Im also prepared that I may learn something about my wife I didn’t know. But my confusion relies on my trust of her how extremely out of character it would be for her to do something like this. We will be meeting with our lawyers and we’ll see what comes in discovery. Thank you all again! Especially for wanting to dive into our finances 🤣. Seriously it’s just the weird way we’ve been doing things our whole lives together.

1mbi6c4,legaladvice,Son died months ago and now my ex wife wants to legally blame me,"Location: Quebec

Honestly never thought I’d post something like this, but here we are.

A few months ago I lost my son. He had a chronic condition manageable tho, but required daily care and medication. He was staying with my ex wife when it happened. She was supposed to give him his meds, monitor him, and take him to his followup, but she didn’t. She got distracted, missed doses, and didn’t even check on him for hours. By the time she did, it was too late.

The autopsy confirmed he died due to complications from his condition triggered by missed medication.
Now she’s telling people and even hinted to her lawyer  that it’s my fault because the day before, I forgot to give him his vitamin supplement (not the meds, just a basic over the counter vitamin). She claims that “weakened him” and “led to the spiral.”

I can’t believe I even have to say this, but the vitamin wasn’t medically critical. The actual medication she missed was. She was the one responsible that day. And now I’m not only grieving, but being blamed for something that didn’t cause his death.

Can someone actually try to build a case like this against me? For negligence or shared responsibility?
I already feel like I failed my son once and don’t want this hanging over me legally too.

1japddf,legaladvice,My wife is 9 months pregnant and unable to move in with me.,"I’ll try to be as direct and straightforward as possible. My wife and I have been legally married since September of last year. She is currently 9 months pregnant and plans on moving into my home in Lamar county TX. She currently lives in and is county locked in Hunt county TX per temporary custody paperwork. We have been waiting to for a court date to have Lamar county added to these order for quite some time, however her ex has repeatedly denied all dates given. He has told her and even sent text messages saying he’s going to drag this out as long as possible purely so she can’t live in the house I own even after the child is born.
  My question is simply this: Would a judge punish her for moving in with her husband and father of her unborn child?

Edit: it has been brought to my attention that I left out key detail and i apologize.
-She’s pregnant with my child
-The ex I referred to is the father of her youngest daughter. He lives in Delta county Tx. Their custody agreement is why she is county locked.

1ioahwj,legaladvice,Got fired on the day I was subpoenaed to witness in court.,"I work for a very small local business that has zero HR and constantly fires people without proper notice, warning, or write-ups. I was served a subpoena to be a witness in court today. I informed my boss immediately and was excused from work for a week because we didn’t know how long it would take. I then asked them to use my PTO. Since it is a small business, they do not have many rules set in place for when you are allowed to request use of your PTO. 

I was in court all day from 9am until about 2:30pm. I called my boss afterwards to confirm that I’d like to return to work. They said, we need to have a conversation about your ability to commit to your shifts. Before this I was out sick for a week with the flu with my wife. We don’t have set rules at this place of about doctor’s notes or otherwise. 

Later today, I returned to work to show my boss the subpoena. They ignored me and didn’t really look at it so I sent them a picture of it. I was called later today and told I was fired for attendance in January which they did not write me up for or give me warnings about. I feel like they made up an excuse to fire me because I was sick and had to go to court when I was planning on going back to work.

1ncvj8y,legaladvice,I was arrested for a crime I didn't do based on false evidence. Charges were dropped but my pets died while I was in jail and I've been unemployed over a year as a result. Is there any recourse?,"A little over a year ago, the police rang my door bell at 2 in the morning and arrested me when I answered the door. I got to jail about 3am and stayed in the waiting area until 10pm that night. I had no food that entire day. I then got moved into a jail cell where I was held for 2 days. I finally got to see a judge who informed me was I arrested for sexually assaulting someone. I also got to see a social worker that day who helped me call a bail bondsman. We got that sorted out, but it took another 1.5 days for me to get released. I was in jail for a total of 5 days.

Apparently the reason I was in jail for so long and things moved so slowly is that the jail has a policy of only moving inmates in certain minimum group sizes and crime was so slow they weren't hitting the group sizes for a long time. That's why I sat in the waiting room all day and took 4 days to get to a judge and released.

When I got my home, I found my two cats dead. I think they died of dehydration. I was also fired from my job as my arrest was publicized.

I hired a criminal defense lawyer. What we discovered is that the victim of this crime gave three totally different descriptions to the police. When she called 911, the next day when she talked to an investigator, and a few days later when she ""remembered"" the details about me. Each description of the person and the car they drove was completely different.

Ultimately the case got dropped as a I had a very strong alibi. My security cameras showed me and my car at home while the crime occurred.

It's been 16 months and I still haven't been able to get a job because the news articles about my arrest are still at the top of my Google search results. I paid my lawyer to get my arrest record cleaned up so I think I have a clean background check or at least will at some point soon. But I still can't even get a company to interview me due to the news articles.

I spoke to my lawyer to see if I have any legal recourse for any of this. To me it seems like incompetent detective work led to my life getting destroyed. My pets are dead. My career has been destroyed. I'm unemployed. I'm publicly humiliated.

My attorney says there is nobody to sue here. Apparently this is how the justice system is supposed to operate. There was evidence from a victim, the police followed up with an arrest, and charges were dropped once they realized it was a mistake. Everything else that has happened is apparently just an accepted consequence. Apparently it's also normal for victims of traumatic crimes to have memory issues and accuse random people after the crime occurs - something about trauma causing false memories to get generated.

Is this right? Do I have any recourse here? It feels like my life has been ruined and I'm supposed to just accept it.

1i7kccl,legaladvice,My customers car was repod while at my mechanic shop! Over 12k in work!,"A customer brought is truck to my mechanic shop in October 2024 stating the engine blew and it needed a new engine.  We inspected the vehicle and sure enough needed an engine so we purchased the used engine for over $7000 and installed the new engine.
Altogether with labor and storage fees, the total came out to about $12,000(the owner was aware of this and signed an invoice.) fast-forward a couple weeks later, after trying to get payment from the guy, a tow truck pulls up to my lot and states that the truck is getting repossessed by the finance company. I told the tow truck driver that the vehicle has $12,000 worth of work not paid for, so no ones going to be taking it. Tow truck driver said he doesn’t want to deal with all this and left without the car. 
I called the owner of the vehicle who had brought it in and told them that the tow truck had come to repossess it and he told me he wasn’t going to be paying for the repairs if they’re repossessing the car. We had no luck getting any payment from the man who brought the car in.

After hearing nothing for a couple weeks, we got a call from the finance company who was repossessing the vehicle, they wanted us to send the invoice of the repairs and let them know how much they will owe so they can come take possession of the vehicle. I sent them the invoice for $12,000 and the next day the lady called back saying that they cannot pay $12,000 but they will offer to pay us $5000 and settle it. I told them that I was not willing to take a $5000 settlement because I have more than that in the engine alone and I really wasn’t comfortable letting the car go until the full invoice was paid. The next day they called back and said we can keep the car Because they are not gonna be paying $12,000 in repairs and it’s not worth it for them pay. 

I understand that I have the right to start on a mechanics lien on the vehicle, but in this situation, who would I go after the owner or the finance company?

Then came the lording that we better respect him or hed take the house away.

And now just today MIL says things are ""very bad behind closed doors"" and i need to pay rent. Trouble is they let me start and get involved with BSN schooling before they told me this. Like they waited until they knew i couldnt pay so id have to snivel and beg for mercy from FIL.

No renters contract was ever signed. Ive been in the house two years. I pay for literally everything (including repairs) except for taxes which im about to anyway.

1ohzgkg,legaladvice,Cut Through an Old Fence to Access My Land Now the Neighbors Are Furious,"Hi everyone,

I recently purchased 10 acres of land in Oklahoma. On one side of my property, there’s a large piece of land about 200 acres that’s been uninhabited for about 20 years. It has an old house on it, and the owners visit about once a month to maintain the place.

Around 10 years ago, they put up a fence because of an easement dispute with my other neighbor. The goal was to block that neighbor from using a powerline easement for access. Later, that neighbor opened a section line on the opposite side of their property for access instead.

The issue is that the fence they built is about 50 feet **inside my property line!** essentially, it’s on the wrong side of the power easement. It’s an old, rusty barbed-wire fence with several fallen trees on it.

I’m currently building my house about 400 feet up the easement. My land is completely wooded and hilly, so this is the best route for power and utilities. (I want to be clear—I’m not trying to cause problems!)

A few weeks ago, I cleared a path up to the easement and cut through the fence so I could drive to my building site. Today, the neighbors came by to maintain their old house, saw the fence cut, and started yelling and screaming at us. They claimed the fence is the property line and that “surveys don’t matter if the fence is already up.” They were entirely out of line and crazy, even when I tried to explain that there is a survey.

I’m trying to figure out if what they’re saying has any legal basis—or if I’m within my rights to tell them to stay off my property.  Is what they are saying even legal????

1okc1u2,legaladvice,My father passed away and a friend of his claims my dad left him my 529 account,"Location: Mississippi

TL;DR at the end

I am 23 and graduated college last December. My college was fully paid for using a 529 account my dad set up when I was young, and there was approximately $50k leftover when I graduated. My dad passed away this past June and has no real family other than me, so pretty much everything he had is coming to me. Unfortunately, his death was unexpected, and as such it’s been a long process figuring out what all he had, where it is, setting up the estate and starting probate, etc. 

My dad had a friend “Bill” with whom he went to medical school. Bill had a rough time in life - he was kicked out of medical school due to substance abuse issues, had an awful marriage to a woman who continued to make his life hell (at least according to him) for years after they divorced, and has accrued a good amount of debt. Despite all this, my dad and Bill remained off-again-on-again friends - for most of my young life, they seemed close and I saw BIll often, but as I got older my dad seemed to grow more and more frustrated with him and would avoid spending time with him whenever possible. My dad did relatively well for himself financially, but from what I’m told, Bill has struggled with debt for a long while. Before dad’s funeral, I had not seen or heard from Bill in several years, but in the last conversation I had with my dad about him, dad was ranting about how he had loaned Bill $15,000 and that he was already asking for more without even saying a proper thank you. 

Due to medical reasons unrelated to his death, my dad wasn’t quite himself mentally for the last few years of his life. So while he did have some choice words about Bill, I don’t know how much of it was true or how much of it he really meant. Bill texted me today telling me he received a letter (I’m not sure from whom, but I assume Charles Schwab) telling him that my dad left him my 529 account, and asking me for information he needed to claim it (Full name, SSN, Address, etc.). I know for certain that this is not in my dad’s will, but I could imagine dad may have put Bill as a successor on the account when they two were closer in case something happened to him while I was still a minor. 

If this account is rightfully his, I won’t try to fight it, but I am a bit confused about all of this. If I’m the beneficiary on the account and I’m of age, do I not get that money for myself? I was planning on either putting it towards grad school or rolling it into a Roth IRA. Also, if he’s the one claiming the account, why would he need so much of my information? I’m not sure how comfortable I feel giving Bill my SSN for an account I’m not even sure is supposed to be his. 

TL;DR - A friend of my deceased father is claiming my dad left him my 529 account - there is money left in it and I am not a minor, does the account not go to me?

This week I had someone pay for a $25 gift card with an old (90s era) 100 dollar bill. I used the counterfeit detection pen to verify, and the line came back yellow (clean). It did not have a reflector strip due to its age. I gave the customer her change, however, when I went to drop it in the safe, the safe would not take the bill. I notified my manager, told her about the situation, and she told me the bill was counterfeit, and that my drawer was now 100 dollars short. At my location, I have been told by managers that if a drawer is short, it will be deducted from my pay. Should I file a wage claim, or what other action should I take?

I work in a high-end nursing home and am really struggling with what I can only describe as a moral crisis. One of my female patients on the skilled nursing unit (most intense level of care) has advanced dementia and is borderline non-verbal. Her husband, who lives in assisted living (much less intense) has been raping her. We can hear her screams, see the bruises from where he holds her down, and have to clean her up after he leaves her naked and in the dark. The facility has involved social workers, nursing staff, and the CEO to no avail. Her own children don't give a damn and just want their parents to have ""alone time."" Adult Protective Services have esentially washed their hands of the matter on the grounds that while she can't consent, she also isn't not consenting (again, even forming sentences is hard for her). I am at the end of my rope here. It makes me physically sick when I think about it. What the hell can we do?

1mbx625,legaladvice,"Texas is mandating I hang the Ten Commandments in my classroom, and my district is banning us from hanging any other religious texts, so what are my options?","Hey r/legaladvice! Apologies in advance if this is the wrong sub to ask for advice. I work as a secondary math teacher for a school district in Northeast Texas (Location: Texas). As I hope many of you can understand, for the sake of my own job, I would prefer not to be more specific about my location.

Earlier today, our district sent out an email informing all staff how new laws (e.g. HB 1481, SB 12, and SB 10) would impact our schools. In regards to **SB 10**, which requires schools to display a copy of the Ten Commandments in every classroom, the email specifically mentioned that “[the Ten Commandments] is the *only* religious text that will be permitted to be displayed in [our district’s] classrooms,” unless otherwise tied to an appropriate TEKS (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills) standard.

As a math teacher who strongly believes the Ten Commandments do not belong in my classroom for any reason whatsoever, I want to know what my options are for legally ‘protesting’ this new law? What other posters can I hang in my classroom (i.e. a First Amendment poster) without worry of serious/legal repercussions and what other recourses do I have?

Thanks in advance! :)

Edit: Wow, this gained a lot of traction very fast! Thank you for all the wonderful people who gave incredibly helpful advice. Unfortunately, as it has been pointed out by a moderator, the law is pretty clear about the size, font, language, wording, and location of the Ten Commandments in the classroom. Also, as a few people noted, I would only need to hang the poster in the event that it was donated from the community or provided by the district, but to avoid any legal issues our district is already going to provide every class a poster. In other words, any potential loopholes in the law are going to be blocked by my own district’s policies to avoid a law suit.

It seems my options are limited to hanging first amendment posters and reaching out to foundations or organizations that are involved in fighting for religious freedom, which I will absolutely be looking into.

People are always parking across his gate either blocking him in or out and if he ever leaves the gate open he ends up with people parking in his yard.

1kc9vpu,legaladvice,Amazon seller threatening legal action if I don’t return their item.,"EDIT: Everything I am finding says that I am covered by Amazon’s TOS. The company violated the TOS just by texting my personal phone number which is apparently a HUGE no-no. I’m going to wait and see what Amazon says with no contact to the company. I am not allowed to contact the company outside of Amazon either according to their policy. 

EDIT 2: For people asking why I don’t just give the couch back, the seller **looked up my personal phone number somehow** (this is NOT given to them by Amazon) and is threatening me with legal action instead of going through Amazon to get anything resolved. That’s shady. They dropped the ball the first time by not responding to Amazon. I don’t owe them anything, it’s not up to me to “make it right” by *their* standards. As a consumer, I’ve done everything correct on my end. 



Location: California. 

I bought a $500 couch off Amazon that was missing the ottoman portion of the couch. I had already built the couch and then realized there was no ottoman. I contacted Amazon and told them there was a missing piece and I wanted to contact the seller to see if they could send it. I said I had already built the couch so I didn’t want to return it, I just wanted the missing pieces. Amazon tried contacting them and no response. So I contacted Amazon again saying I hadn’t received a response. The Amazon employee said because they hadn’t gotten back to me, he would give me a full $500 refund and said I could keep the couch. Fine with me! 

This morning I woke up to a text from the seller threatening legal action. Here’s the text:

“Hi [my name]

This is the Amazon vendor whom you bought the U shape sofa from. 
You mentioned that you were missing the ottoman cushions and the cover in your last message with us.

While we respect Amazon's decision to grant a full refund, we must clarify that retaining the product without returning it to our company violates both our Return Policy and Amazon's terms of service. As the refund has been processed, the product rightfully belongs to our company and needs to be returned immediately.
To resolve this matter amicably, we WARN you to take ​one of the following actions WITHIN 48 HOURS of this notice:
​
1. Repay the refunded amount in full to reinstate ownership of the product. If you really don't have the ottoman cushion and cover, we can send you the replacement.
​2. Return the product to us, we can provide you with a FREE label to return if the product is in its original condition.
3. Respond to this text for discussions on any other reasonable resolutions.

Failure to respond or comply within the stipulated timeframe will leave us no choice but to escalate this matter through LEGAL channels to recover our losses and protect our business interests.

We sincerely hope to resolve this issue cooperatively and look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
Alex”


I’m assuming that I am in the right here since Amazon is the one who facilitated all of this? I would have been fine with even just a partial refund for the ottoman, but I’m not going to argue with Amazon trying to give me my money back lol. 

I contacted Amazon and told them everything and included the text that the seller sent me. They said they’ll have an update in 1-3 days.

So this is a &lt; $400 USD issue, but it's a ""principle of the matter"" situation. Last night, I ordered two kegs for my brother's wedding, &amp; dropped them off at the open bar. At the end of the night, the venue bartender told me that one keg was done and the other was almost out. They weren't. Not even close. We still had like 80% left in each.

Here's the problem though, an hour and a half into the wedding she was telling the guests that we were out of beer, and started serving mixed drinks exclusively. The liquor we bought is obviously shelf stable, but now I've got over 25 gallons of beer that's probably gone bad by now. I get that you're gonna have leftover beer after a wedding, but she was telling people early on that we were out.

I'm 60/40 on she was lying (for mixed drink tips) vs she didn't know how to tap a keg properly.

1o9on5u,legaladvice,Court says I did not appear to my hearing. Should I call their BS and tell them I audio recorded it?,"Location: CA

I had a court hearing with the State of California, Department of Social Services (CDSS) for a Medi-Cal appeal. This hearing was led by a Los Angeles County Administrative Law Judge and was done over a recorded WebEx meeting 10 days ago. Today, I received an update from CDSS. A letter from an Administrative Law Judge states that I did not appear for my hearing and my appeal is dismissed. I can ask to reopen the appeal but ""To do this, you must give a good reason for not attending the hearing.""

It is so frustrating that the county claims I wasn't there when there is video record of my hearing. Luckily, I wanted a personal copy of the video hearing so I audio recorded the majority of it on my phone. Was that legal? I opened this appeal 2 months ago. The judge essentially ruled in my favor during my hearing. I am going to call the State Hearings Division first thing Monday morning, but when they ask for my ""reason for not attending the hearing"" should I mention that I have audio proof of my appearance or should I simply say that *I was present* and *they* need to retrieve the video recording of our WebEx meeting? I do not want to self-incriminate but I also refuse to allow myself to be gaslit.

Edit: I did not inform the other parties (Judge and CDSS Rep) that I was audio recording.

Edit 2: I understand that I should not have recorded the conversation since I did not ask for nor receive consent from the other parties. I will request that they review their copy of the hearing since we were on a recorded WebEx meeting. Thank you for your help.

**Edit 3: This was my first time posting in this subreddit. I just want to say thank you for your helpful engagement.** I expressed my initial frustration by thinking to myself, ""You think I didn't show up to my hearing? REALLY?! Well, let me show you how dumb you are to say that!"" There was some fascinating thoughts about two-party consent and whether that would matter given that we all consented to being recorded on WebEx. Also, there were some questions about my own engagement during the hearing. I probably spoke for 1/3 of the 30 minute hearing, so I am sure they will update their decision once I kindly ask them to review their files. I feel more understanding toward whoever sent the ""failure to appear"" letter. This is a normal human error during a time where the court's (already) stressful job is probably all the more overwhelming. Take care fellow human!

Edit 4: Since I have continued to receive responses to this post. I called the office of state hearings on Monday explaining the mistake (without mentioning the audio recording).

1n2l3wv,legaladvice,My work’s on-site police officer searched my car when I wasn’t around and found my pepper spray.,"Location: Chattanooga, TN, USA.
38, Female.

So to add a bit of info, I am a security guard at a manufacturer facility that makes certain things that I won’t name, but it’s a heavily guarded facility. My job is to sit in my car one hour to watch the employee entrance, then do a foot patrol around the perimeter the next hour. This is an unarmed position, and the company I work for makes it clear we are not to have any weapons on us on site.

Being a 5’3” woman, for obvious reasons, I keep some pepper spray in my car. This is also not allowed per my company’s policy, but after dealing with the things I’ve dealt with, my personal safety matters more to me than that. I’ve never taken it out of my car or used it to intimidate anyone, and until a week ago, it was never an issue.

Last week, I left my car to do one of my usual patrols and forgot to lock my car. It takes me about 25-30 minutes to walk the perimeter and check the gates and doors. When I got back to my car, our on-site police officer was waiting for me by my car and told me he seized the pepper spray I kept in my center console. He lectured me about how I should know better than to have a weapon on site, and he would be contacting my manager to report it.

I told him he didn’t have permission to enter or search my car, and he told me he didn’t need a warrant or permission when I am on company property. My manager told me having the pepper spray on site is a fireable offense, and I more than likely will lose my job after her and HR has a meeting about it.

1hdn6nw,legaladvice,"(WA State) My brother died as a sole tenant and the landlord sent me a bill for ""early lease termination"" for tens of thousands of dollars in owed rent through the remaining lease duration. What are our rights?","My brother passed away in late September this year from a sudden illness. He was the sole tenant of his apartment unit and possessed of a meager ""estate"", a word I use solely for legal purposes as he owned barely anything more than what was in his apartment , a car, and a storage unit the apartment provided in the basement parking garage for his use. My brother also had little savings to speak of and a modest 401k with a loan he took out against it in order to afford a road trip he surprised us with as his last wish (he knew he was dying big picture and wanted to share some final memories with me &amp; our dad but the swiftness of his actual passing surprised everyone, including his doctors, who thought he had up to a year to live, if not potentially more with certain treatments).

After my brother's death, we had the post office re-direct all his mail to me so that I could help keep watch for anything needing addressing and I just received a bill from his apartment complex claiming that my brother performed ""early lease termination"" and is liable for 5 figures in owed rent through the end of his lease agreement. Curiously, the letter states that my brother is owed his security deposit back BUT that the complex is somehow also crediting it against this owed amount, with the deposit clearing less than 10% of what they claim is owed.  Lastly, the apartment complex included in this bill a charge for cleaning his apartment, largely referring to furniture &amp; left belongings -- while my father &amp; I were able to travel in from out of state to be with my brother in his final hours, we are of limited means ourselves and were only able to gather a handful of things he wanted us to have or which were meaningful to us before departing for the last time, leaving some furniture &amp; furnishings behind.

I know that since neither my nor my father's name is on the Lease that we do not owe anything to the apartment complex are not liable for the claimed costs. However, the letter mentions the apartment's ""Billing Department"" and I'm aware that is often legal-ese for Collections, which given the amount involved leads me to believe they may attempt legal resolutions of this claimed debt against my brother's ""estate"".

Furthermore, what online research I've done leads me to believe that Washington Law in fact requires certain efforts on the apartment complex's part (See: RCW 59.18.595, [linked here](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.595)) and we are not aware of any of these being made; for example, we have not been made aware of what furniture they believe was left behind or where it is currently located that we may retrieve it nor does the bill they sent us count any sale of any things left behind as credit towards the amount they claim is owed.

Lastly, I can confirm that the apartment complex was made aware of my brother's death by early November at the latest, as we spoke to them about his death and asked their help in identifying where a kayak of his went that was stolen from his secured parking spot. They refused to help despite confirming they had video cameras covering the parking spot in question and they similarly refused to identify which storage unit was his so that we could access it. Meanwhile, the bill they sent is dated December 2, well after them being informed of his passing, yet it is still addressed to my brother as if he is a living, willful actor in having ""terminated his lease"".

What are our rights in this situation and what, if anything, is expected of the apartment complex legally vs. what they've done so far re: sending us this bill and the contents of it?

I recently applied for a position at a company I previously worked for. I worked fifteen years, and submitted a four week notice before leaving on what I assumed was good terms. My application was denied and so I reached out to the director asking why.

He told me the reason was because the company had me on a “do not rehire” list.

1lme0yh,legaladvice,"Bank froze my account until I provide proof of citizenship. Bank refuses to accept naturalization certificate, state ID, social security card, or veterans ID as proof. I have no idea what to do anymore.","Hi, just wanted to come back and update in case this helps anyone in the future. After a week of no access I was finally able to access my account. It’s amazing how fast things changed when I reported them to the CFPB. Lessons were definitely learned here and I have closed this account with this bank and found a different one. I now have two bank accounts at two separate institutions, now have a credit card, and am working on getting a US passport. Thanks to everyone for the advice. I truly appreciate it!


Hi, I am just reaching out to see the legality behind my current situation. 

Location: Louisiana

Background: I came to the US in 2011. I opened a bank account using my green card and Cuban passport. I have since become a naturalized citizen. I was notified on 6/23/25 that my bank account has been restricted because my Cuban passport and green card has expired. I brought my naturalization certificate, state id, veterans ID card, and social security card to the bank. They are saying they cannot unfreeze my account with these documents because they cannot verify that I am legal citizen. They also stated that since I came from Cuba and it is a country on a restricted list, it further complicates things. They keep saying I need a primary document as proof. When I ask them what constitutes a primary document they tell me a valid passport or green card. I do not have a US passport, my Cuban passport expired, and obviously no longer have a green card because I am a naturalized citizen. They refuse to take my naturalization certificate as a primary document. I have spent the last 3 days trying to get this sorted out just to be told by the bank I won’t get answers until maybe Monday. I have filed a complaint with the CFPB yesterday, and received a call from the bank today saying they are going to investigate the issue and will hear back from them in a few days. I asked a few days ago if I could get a W-9 to fill out to see if that would be helpful, and they said they requested one and will let me know when they receive it.  Since my bank account has been frozen, I cannot buy food, buy gas, pay bills, pay for my dog’s emergency medical bills, or the emergency surgery she needs. I am left with nothing. 

Questions: 
Is lawful for the bank freeze my account and refuse to accept my naturalization certificate, state ID, veterans ID, and social security card as proof of citizenship? 

What rights, if any, do I have here?

Anyone encounter a similar situation and have any advice on how to resolve it?

Said 'they don't have the authority to arrest him' because an officer wasn't present at the time of the assault, even though we have video footage of the incident from 2 angles.","crossposted because I can't post in my city subreddit. Location: Indianapolis, Indiana

I know it sounds stupid, because it is.

The assault occurred at roughly 11am today. It was captured on video from 2 different angles. The police were called, a report was made. The man who threw the coffee had escaped but the authorities were informed of the incident and shown the footage.

About 3 hours later, I see the guy from the footage in the bushes. I go outside and confirm that it is the exact man... 6'2, black, tan shirt and ripped jeans. I immediately call 911 and say ""hey the guy who threw coffee at my coworker is back on the property please send the cops.""

The cop arrives, a shorter redhead man with a beard. I'm waiting with my phone in hand with the two videos. He tells me to back off and approaches the guy. I'm giddy, thinking 'we got him'

I give the cop his space, but I overhear him telling the guy ""a private citizen is asking you to leave..."" I interjected, ""no, we want to press charges. he's on video throwing scalding hot coffee on my coworker a few hours ago, the police were already here.""

the cop shut me down and wouldn't let me speak. He insisted that he 'doesn't have the authority to make an arrest because an officer wasn't present at the time of the assault.'

obviously this is retarded. I tell him, ""I have it on video, he's the guy, wearing the same outfit...' this cop is shouting me down. He's treating me like a criminal. I literally call 911 again as the criminal is walking away and said, ""i need a supervisor... the cops are letting a guy go who threw coffee on my coworker. I have everything on video and the cops won't even listen to me.""

a supervisor NEVER comes, but he calls back. He backs up his boys, says ""it has to go through the prosecutors before we make an arrest""

1ibfuos,legaladvice,"Friend sleeping at gas station completely sober arrested for dwi, is there a case to sue, or is it useless?","My friend (who’s Canadian) was sleeping in the back of a vehicle in South Dakota at a gas station, because he was low on gas and the gas station didn’t open for a few hours. He has a setup in the back for sleeping, so he slept and was woken up by a couple officers. They immediately assumed he was impaired, he tried working with them and complying. They said they smelt weed in his car, which he hasn’t smoked in years. He allowed them to search his car, he passed the breathalyzer, so they made him do a field sobriety test, he didn’t do terribly, but it’s up to their opinion on whether he passed or not, so of course they failed him. They found a scale in his car that is used to weigh food, because he’s big into the gym. They assumed it was for drugs. They arrested him and took him into the station, where they did a blood draw, and then he sat in jail for 10 hours before being released. 

Based off of the information above, does he have a case to sue? He was completely sober, doing the safe thing by not running out of gas on the highway and waiting for the station to open, and somehow he’s guilty until proven innocent and arrested for no reason. He’s got a court case in a month that should be an easy win, after that should he look for lawyers to sue? Or is this pointless and just move on with life.

1okl8or,legaladvice,Ex gifted my kid traceable AirPods during supervised visit California,"I have a protective order against my ex husband, the children are listed as included parties in both the protective order and the restraining order.

He has supervised visits with a social worker present. A few visits ago he gave my son brand new unopened AirPods during their visit. This visit he gave my other son a brand new box of air pods with the seal broken which he said was because he wanted to make sure the right product was in the box. 

When my son went to set up the AirPods his phone gave him a notification that the AirPods can be traced by the owner then it showed a partially concealed email that is the beginning and end of my ex’s email address and he named the device with a name he uses on social media. 

What are my options? When he’s violated the restraining order in the past it wasn’t taken seriously but that was before the protective order and him being placed on domestic violence probation. My concern is he can just pretend it was a mistake and he was giving him his old AirPods even though they were clearly new and I know that he did this with the intention of tracking the kids.

Location: California


Update: Thank you so much to everyone who gave advice and words of encouragement! 

This happened at night after the police station was closed (other than emergency services of course) and we were at an address that he already knows of. I went to Target that same night and got my kid a brand new pair.

The next morning I filed a police report and gave the pair being tracked to the police. I also emailed the DA who initially handled his case and CC’d the victims advocate, requesting his probation officers information. Once I have a police report I will notify probation.

I notified the social worker and he is no longer allowed to bring gifts to the visit. He can only buy them things infront of the social worker moving forward.

I also want to point out to everyone playing devils advocate and acting like this was an innocent mistake, there is a reason I posted this on legal advice and not parent advice! There is a HUGE difference with someone you coparent with doing this vs someone you have a protective order and supervised visit doing this! Neither of those things are given out lightly in California meaning there was clear evidence of danger and even a plea deal involved!

A while later, the car was found more than 600 miles away from me. I live in SF and the car was found in San Diego. The tow yard that picked it up never notified me no call, no letter, nothing. I only found out because the police called me.

When I contacted the tow yard, I asked if they could send me photos before I decided whether to pick it up, since the car is only worth about $3k. They were rude and flat-out told me they weren’t going to send me anything, and that if I wanted to see the car, I had to go there in person. Even the police officer who called me tried to get them to send photos they said they would, but they never did.

Now the tow yard is suing me in small claims court for $12,000 in towing and storage fees. The car itself is worth maybe $3k at best. It feels completely unreasonable and abusive.

My infant son (7 months old) has a serious form of epilepsy, so we’re in and out of the hospital frequently. This admission, they started him on a high-dose steroid - the plan was to be in for 2-3 days while he got started on it to make sure he reacted well. They requested we bring the medication ourselves because it isn’t stocked here. 

This medication took ~4 weeks to obtain via a specialty pharmacy. The retail cost is $100,000 for a four-week course. We brought the entire thing with us, which was 3 vials, because we didn’t know what the dosing is. Upon admission the nurses took the meds from us to bring to their pharmacy for refrigeration. 

Now we’re ready to be discharged and have just been told they can’t locate the remaining vials for us to go home with. They believe they were accidentally discarded. So we’re essentially stuck in the hospital while my son tapers back off the medication (not an easy task for something that affects your brain chemistry…) and then he’ll have to come back in again to restart it. Unless they can somehow obtain more for us in a very expedited manner. 

I’m so frustrated and also heartbroken because we love our doctors here.

This morning I woke up to my 4YO daughter asking me where Daddy was. I was confused because he wakes up, makes her breakfast and takes over baby care since I am newly PP. It was 10AM and she said he wasn't there. She had been waiting in her room for him to take her downstairs for their normal routine. She waited until she was too hungry to wait more time and then came to our room to wake me up.

I got up out of bed and I started looking around upstairs. He wasn't in the house. when I opened up the bathroom door in our room, that's when I started noticing something was REALLY wrong. ALL his stuff from our bathroom was GONE. I opened up the closet, his clothes were ALL gone. At this point I'm freaking out. I go downstairs and see our front door was LEFT OPEN and our cat is no longer in the house. He took our car as well. I started calling him but every call went to voicemail. I was openly crying at this point and my daughter was becoming upset. The baby was in my arms as well. I didn't want to freak out my daughter any more than I already had so I told her that everything was ok and I'd make her breakfast.

After setting my daughter up, I started going through the house. He took all his clothes and gaming consoles, computers. All of it is gone. He took the only car we have. This was not the worst of it. I checked our bank account. He drained the account and left $17 in it. I have no idea what to do. I have no family. I tried calling his mother and she cussed me out and blocked me. He has no siblings and his dad died so it's really just his mom. I have no idea what to do. His mom has never liked me because she felt I was taking away her son. I was extremely LC with her before this point so I don't know what I really expected from her. I am at a loss because I just has a c section and he knows how much that has destroyed me.

I am a stay at home mom, I am completely dependent on my husband. I was not intending to be one but because we live in a remote area and we have no family here, we decided this would be best and he makes a very good salary to support us with a lot left over. How could he just leave us like this? What can I do in this situation? I put in a call to our vet about the cat so I'm hoping I can resolve at least that aspect soon. I'm just so scared and confused about where to go from here. I don't know how I'm going to pay bills or feed my daughter a week from now.

Please help me understand my options. This has honestly brought on some very dark thoughts and I have no one to turn to.

1jsl67v,legaladvice,"My cousin, a US citizen, seems to have died mysteriously at a resort in the Bahamas last night. Staff are opaque. What can we do? (MD)","Location: MD (if it matters?) Is there anything we can do that we haven't already done for my cousin and his family?

My cousin was visiting a resort in the Bahamas with his family. They only touched down yesterday morning. At 11:41pm last night, he sent his mother a text, telling her that he was going to get something to eat. 

Beyond this, the story appears confusing. 

At around 3am, the police (or security?) contacted his mother at their hotel room to let her know they were investigating her son regarding an incident in a restaurant, where he allegedly spat on hotel staff after being denied access to a restricted area (this is very unlike him, but who knows). Right after this incident, he was spotted by a security guard running through a nearby casino, so quickly that he dropped his phone. They had found that phone, which may be how they connected him to his mother. 

The security guard stated that he made a right turn out of the casino. However, according to his mother, this right turn would have led to a dead end, meaning he couldn't have possibly gone that way. 

We learned the following information after a call to the US Embassy in the Bahamas, to report a missing US citizen. At 6am that morning, an unresponsive person was found floating on the reef near the resort. The individual was taken to a nearby hospital. At some point during this process (whether on the scene, en-route to the hospital, or at the hospital is unclear), the individual was pronounced dead. The police stated to the Embassy that this body is indeed his, referring to him by first and last name, but we are unaware of how they determined this (we don't know that he had any identifying information on his person). They did not share this confirmation with his mother, but they did contact her about the body. 

The police told her that she would not be able to identify them until Monday. They explicitly stated that this was not a homicide. They even had the coroner visit her at the apartment she was staying in. I'm unsure how this was determined so quickly. 

We called the hospital that the police told the Embassy that he was sent to. They have no record of him. They also have no unidentified decedents. 

We (the rest of the family, in the US) also called the resort to ask if they (family in the Bahamas) could possibly post flyers around to see if anyone had seen him. His mother and father are too distraught to be of much help right now. When we called, the staff was incredibly dismissive, and brusque. We were told not to intercede on behalf of the family, the staff member assuring us that his mother would have likely reached out (she had, I believe) and to allow local police to handle it.

To clarify: we were not blaming them for the disappearance or asking him to help us find him, only asking if there was anything else we, or they, could do. The shift manager we were eventually transferred seemed to be in a panic. He attempted to hang up on us repeatedly as soon as we explained what was wrong, cutting us off by saying ""okay, bye!"" multiple times,  and repeatedly stated that there was nothing that they could do. The shift manager was apparently aware of the situation prior to our call, as he asked if we were calling about the missing person as soon as we were transferred. 

Is there anyone else I should be contacting? I'm confused and worried.

My old work email is disabled, but I can see in the audit trail that it was routed to a generic legal inbox and someone “applied template fields.” When I asked my former manager he said it was just the standard template and my signature probably autopopulated from last time. He said not to worry, legal wanted it done fast. I am worried, because my name is on a contract for a company I do not work for.

Questions, what is the correct way to make them stop using my name and picture and to deal with the NDA that shows my signature. Do I send a written cease and desist, or is there a specific California right of publicity or identity misuse claim that fits. Do I need to file a police report if they actually reused my signature image, or is that overkill. Should I contact DocuSign support to flag the signature as unauthorized and ask for revocation, or is that something only the company can do. The NDA says California law and has my title under the signature block, so I am worried a vendor could rely on it and I get pulled into something. I kept copies of the team page, the sales deck pdf with my bio, the DocuSign certificate of completion, and the emails to HR. I also still have my offer letter and my resignation acceptance from HR that shows my last day. I can afford a consult if needed, I just want to know the right first step that preserves my options. I do not want damages or anything, I just want my face off their website and my name off any documents I did not sign. If it matters, I never had officer authority, I was a product marketing lead, and only the COO used to sign NDAs. Any advice on the order of actions, certified letter to HR and legal, report to DocuSign, complaint to state AG or something like that.

1in17r9,legaladvice,"Stolen iPhone pings at my house, searched my daughters backpack at school.","I should start by saying, neither myself nor my daughter have/had the iPhone. 
My daughter text me from class today and tells me they pulled her out and searched her bag for a stolen iPhone that pinged at our house last night.  They told her that it was now pinging from the classroom she was in. They found nothing in her backpack and nobody else was searched. 
Am I wrong to think they lied about it pinging in the classroom so that they could search her bag? 

I called the school police officer and he said it pinged at our house and that the owners claimed they came by last night but nobody came by last night and I was home all night long. 
He wouldn’t directly answer my question as to why nobody else in class was searched if it was pinging there. All he said was they were going to wait until after this period and ping it again to see where it is.  I know from experience that Find My IPhone can be way off at times. 
 My main questions are, if it pings at my home or around my home what does that give police the right to do? Is that grounds to come in my home to search for it? 
Also, was it legal for them to lie about it pinging in the classroom so that they could search my daughter’s bag? Am I wrong for feeling like they handled the situation wrong? 
Again, neither of us have the phone or have ever seen the phone. 

Update: 
Phone was found. No where near my daughter or her backpack or my home.  I’m glad it was found.   
After my “outraged parent defending their child” wore off and I did some thinking I realized that on school grounds they probably have the right to search freely. I do believe they should reach out to the parent first to inform them of the situation BUT given the amount of school shootings and just overall craziness that happens in our schools…they should have the right to freely search if it keeps our kids safe.

1j21m1a,legaladvice,My neighbors trashed my yard when they removed 3 of my trees without my permission,"I woke up a couple days ago and 3 of my trees were already gone. They were about to cut a fourth when my husband ran outside to stop them. We told them they were our trees but they did not agree . So my husband made them stop cutting on our side of the property until they have a surveyor come out and complete a survey of the property. A guy came out the following day to survey the yard and when the stakes went into the ground and the lines were made the tree stumps were clearly on our property. These trees were not just some small plants that won't be missed. They were 70 ft tall and so wide that they blocked the entire side of my yard. Meaning they made a wall in between our property and our neighbors property. They were very ornamental and added a lot of beauty to not only our property but the street we live on. They gave us a huge amount of privacy and blocked us from seeing all the homes to the left of our house. Those trees made us feel like we had our own private sanctuary. It's one of the reasons we bought this house. Because we loved how private and detached our yard felt . These trees also kept neighbors from seeing our house and in our window. We feel completely exposed now. Not only outside but also in our home. The only thing my neighbors had to say about what they did was "" I'm sorry but, i didn't think it would be this big of a deal."" Her husband not only hasn't not said a word to us about it but he won't even look at us . They are actually upset with us for not allowing them to continue cutting our trees that at they think are ""ugly"". Her reasoning for cutting down our trees was absolutely ridiculous. Basically she is too lazy to trim back some branches. She offered to buy us two new trees but the trees they took down are irreplaceable. She said we can order two trees from lowe's and they will be here in 2 days. First of all they cut down 3 and secondly i don't want some small trees from Lowe's. I want my 70 ft Cedars back. Now about a fifth of my front yard is a giant empty bed where the trees used to be. It's just a big mound of dirt and sticks and 3 giant tree stumps. They literally have about a foot and a half of property on our side . The rest is mine so this doesn't affect their yard  . I told them and the tree Company they hired not to touch anything on my property or the property line again. They had plans to replant trees of their choice in the  place of my trees. Which isn't going to happen. I have repeatedly told them in text and in person that we need to talk about this before anything is done there and they disregard me. After everything that has happened and how upset and angry they know we are , they still tried to grind down the stumps. We ran out and told the tree guys once again to get off our property and not to touch anything on the property line or our property. I had to tell them we consider the stumps evidence and if they remove them they will be removing evidence. Seems the tree Company understands that they have F'ed up my my neighbors not only don't get why we are upset , they don't get that what they have done is trespass on my property and damage my property. They are treating me like I have done something to them. I have decided to cut all contact with them. They were at one time people i considered friends and very good neighbors. Now, I think they are major assholes. Instead of looking out my window and seeing my gorgeous trees , i get to see them parking their cars in their front yard like we live in a trailer park. This is going to affect the value of my home. If i try to sell it tomorrow i wont get what i would have for it last week because it has no curb appeal now and because the front yard is trashed because of this. I have been crying on and off for days, I cant sleep because of this. I am also irate at their behavior and lack of remorse. Her ""I'm sorry but i didn't think it would be such a big deal"" is not an apology. Real genuine apologies don't come with a but. I don't know what to do but I have to do something to protect my investment. If they try to destroy the stumps again or come on to my property I'm calling the police and having them trespassed. Does anyone have any advice?

1orxocn,legaladvice,Paid $3k for meet and greet but advertised guests didn’t show,"I bought VIP tickets for a live show that cost $995 each. The podcast host repeatedly said on her podcast that the VIP meet and greet would include meeting her and the guests she listed. She said this clearly more than once, and it was the only reason I purchased the VIP package.

I bought multiple VIP tickets, so the total was over $3k. When we arrived, the meet and greet only included the host. None of the guests she advertised were there. Other stops appear to include the guests. (Guests are different at each stop.)

The Ticketmaster description did not list the guests, but the host herself promoted the VIP experience in a way that would make any reasonable person believe the guests would be present. That was the main selling point, and it was not delivered.

There was also a preshow cocktail reception, but it was a cash bar, which surprised many VIP attendees considering the price. Even though the fine print did not explicitly say drinks were included, it felt misleading to call it a VIP cocktail reception at this price point with no drinks provided.

Do I have any grounds to request a partial refund or dispute this as a service not provided or misleading promotion? Or since the fine print did not list the guests, am I stuck?

1j3jbts,legaladvice,Landlady said I can't use the outlet on my townhouse to charge my car,"I purchased an electric car 2 months ago.  I use a LVL1 charger at my townhouse from a regular outlet outside of the house I rent. I am a 22M in student housing and I recently graduated but am trying to take advantage of cheap rent as long as I can. I got an email saying that I cannot use my charger to charge my car anymore because it is a tripping hazard. I replied back saying I will take the proper safety precautions to make sure it is not a hazard and that if they can tell me where I am breaking the lease by charging my car then I am more than happy to stop. The landlady called me right after saying that I was being ""Snappy"" and ""Rude."" Then she said that if she tells me something that I better listen. I asked if I covered the cord with one of those construction cord channels that is discrete if it would be an issue and she told me that I cannot use the outlet to charge my car at all. I asked her why can I not use the outlet when there are plenty of diesel trucks and other electric cars that use the outlets all the time and she said they ""figured it out with them."" I asked if we could work out an agreement and I would be happy to increase my rent for any extra electricity I use but she snapped at me again and she told me if I continued to use the outlet they would tow my car and it would be my fault. I read that in my state there is a ""Right to Charge Law"" where landlords cannot prevent tenants from charging as long as it is safe and I pay for the electricity and I am not sure how to bring this up, and from my POV she seems completely in the wrong as I pay rent and that outlet is connected to the house I rent can be used how I want(in a safe manner). I have a feeling it may be a political thing because its a Tesla and those are controversial but there are at least 4-5 people who use the outside outlet to charge their car or plug in their diesel trucks.

Is she trying to take advantage of me because I am some 22 year old naive student, and what course of action should I take?  I think she called me because she didn't want it in writing that if she tells me to do something I better listen.

EDIT: I am located in Colorado

  
EDIT2: Thank you for all the advice, I do see her point of view and as to why it may not be a great idea. I am going to talk to her and see if there are any safe options that the company would be okay with me using and if not just give up on it for now. 

To clear some confusion from the original post: I pay a flat rate for electricity and offered to pay for any excess I used. I know I came off like a dick but it was sort of hard not too when she was degrading me on the phone and told me that she came to agreements with other tenants but did not want to come to an agreement with me. I apologized for coming off snappy in my email and explained that I just did not think it was a violation of the lease, and she has responded since saying that maintenance is going to see if there is anything they can do and to not use the outlet for now and I plan on respecting her wishes.

Also for everyone concerned about me being in student housing, prior to signing my lease I asked if I graduated early would I be able to stay for the remainder and they said this was a common occurrence and there was no issue with that.

FINAL EDIT
I met with the leasing office today and fortunately this does have a happy ending. They agreed to install 240v outlets that I can pay for a parking spot to use. This is actually better than the current situation I had and I just have to pay an extra 30 per month to use the outlets and have my own dedicated parking spot. The landlady said that she didn’t mean to be rude and I apologized as well and she said that there have been many requests for dedicated outlets to use, and with this solution there will be no extension cords or any cords running on sidewalk. I think that while I may have not went about this the best way, it ended up working out well.

I never signed anything and was told it was a recorded agreement by my realtor ( now his)but only found out it wasn’t recorded when I checked my title after he listed his place for sale in July and, when I told him he had no right to water he offered me cash (not much) to make a contract for half interest so he could sell it with his cottage.

Meanwhile an oak tree crushed his rooftop water tank so I cut off his water pipe because the tank was gapping open, he tried to patch  it with duct tape,  and it was a health issue. I then proceeded hooking my well up to my house as it wasn’t plumbed to my place when I bought.

He and his lawyer are now demanding $20,000 (and an additional $200. Per day until full restoration) in 10 days or he sues. Lawyer says I admitted to vandalism and acknowledged the existence of an unrecorded agreement. Is this extortion and should I lawyer up? Location: Kern County,California

1jxs3eo,legaladvice,Doctor “forgot” to tell us he had cancer 9 months ago,"Location: Missouri
My boyfriend has been chronically ill for the past few years with lots of testing and trips to the doctor for his symptoms.  With all of that testing has come with a few incidental findings, such as discovering he has pituitary tumors.  This sent him to an endocrinologist this past July to review the tumors and possible impact they would have on him, which she told us that they shouldn’t be causing any issues.  I was at this appointment with him and the doctor was very dismissive of everything and told him to just follow up in 6 months with more pituitary scans.

Since then, everything has gotten significantly worse. His exhaustion, his pain.  A never-ending list of new symptoms.  A few nights ago, he was scouring over his medical records trying to find something that made sense. Reading old doctors notes and looking at old test results.  When looking over the notes at the endocrinologist office, at the very end of her notes she wrote “The management of the patient's medullary thyroid cancer and elevated calcitonin and CEA levels requires regular monitoring and cooperation with their oncologist.”  

These are words that were never said to us during the appointment. Nothing about thyroid cancer was discussed.   He called his doctors office yesterday and spoke with a nurse who confirmed that medullary thyroid cancer is correct, and she was apologetic for him having to find out like this.  Told him that she would have his GP and the endocrinologist call him and put him on the urgent list.  We never heard back from them on Friday.  

At this point, we don’t know how badly the cancer has spread since July.   I know his symptoms have gotten significantly worse.  We are furious and confused and don’t know how this was allowed to happened especially considering the doctor wrote in her notes from the appointment like she had discussed it with us.  

Where do we go from here? Is there a legal recourse for something like this?  ",3914,0.96,3914,0,4084.0,170.0,89,1744493880.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jxs3eo/doctor_forgot_to_tell_us_he_had_cancer_9_months/,False,True

1kyl26m,legaladvice,"Bought a new house, neighbor blocks our driveway.","Location: Oregon 

UPDATE:

Thank you everyone for your helpful advice! I wasn't expecting so many responses! 

I see a lot of people mentioning why we didn't do something sooner, when I say we just moved in, we just moved in this past Monday. We haven't even been at the new house for a week! I wouldn't say I'm a pushover, just with buying a new house and planning a move, this was not on my bingo card.
 

But

Turns out he did good on his promise and talked to a lawyer, who told him it was illegal to block a driveway, regardless of any contract and that the contract in question is null and void since the previous owner moved away,  but regardless blocking someone else's driveway is still illegal 😂 

he came over and apologized,  he also brought some store-bought cookies, an apology letter and the contract with the former owner for us to keep or destroy. I think this is a nice olive branch for the situation. 

He wants to start over again and welcome us into the neighborhood.

I'm hoping we can turn the corner and start a new with our new neighbor. 

He seemed pretty embarrassed and genuinely seems sorry. He's an older guy so maybe he just didn't know the laws or isn't good with change????
He definitely he has egg on his face... hopefully we can just enjoy being each other's neighbors in the meantime...and maybe one day this will just be a funny story. 

Anyways, Definitely an interesting way to be greeted into the neighborhood 😂




Okay, so this is pretty straightforward but not really sure where to go or what to do. Just bought a new house How exciting! Our realtor told us to expect some surprises. Here is our first and major surprise, our neighbor likes to park and  block our driveway. He seems to be an avid car collector and has quite a few. 

We didn't really notice it because I guess he parks his daily driver in front of our driveway. So when we were touring the house and whatnot, he was away at work. We've noticed the issue when we need to leave our driveway for work and his car is blocking us in. We've knocked on the door and had a few discussions with him about how that's not acceptable and he's busted out a handwritten contract that he had with the previous owner stating that it was okay for him to block her driveway. He let me read the contract and it does state that he can block our driveway from the hours of 8pm to 8m everyday of the week. 

The previous owner was an elderly woman who did not drive so I can imagine it was not an inconvenience to her. 

 He's threatened us with legal action and told us that because he has a contract he can legally park there. I don't think that's true. Also, I'm aware that we have to live next to this man for the next handful of years and I want to approach this situation delicately without necessarily getting the courts involved but I just would like to know what my rights are. 

I think because the contract was with the former tenant, it's null and void. 

Any idea how to make peace with our new neighbor and still have the ability to pull in and out of our driveway? I'm kind of at my wit's end so any advice is majorly appreciated.

The nurse saw I was there for post op, asked what I had done. I told her a diagnostic, D&amp;C and that I was supposed to get my tubes removed but didn't. She seemed confused and pretty much just got the doctor in without saying much. He came in quickly, immediately went over what he did. Showed me pictures, pointed out some endo he burned. Talked about some fluid build up removed and amidst pointing to various organs pointed at my tubes. I let him finish his blurb and he asked if I had any questions. ""So when can I actually get my tubes removed?"" He seemed confused. Back and forth looking at his computer while I gave him the run down of what we talked about, what I expected, and what seemed to not happen. He confirmed I didn't get them removed and said that it would have been a great time to remove them because he was already in there. I agreed. He went through the computer and confirmed it had been on the to-do list. He apologized profusely admitting that he 'messed up big time'. Said that he had requested it, planned to do it, but forgot to add it to the day of consent form and completely overlooked it. He said he wasn't sure what he could do to fix things and make things right. I said he could actually remove them..? He laughed and said ""yeah. Yeah I could"". He told me his person would call to get me scheduled in for another surgery and stressed that she works for multiple doctors and can schedule me with any of them if I didn't feel comfortable with him and to just let her know. I said the healing and everything was great and I had no other issues, so I'm fine with him being the one to do it, so long as it's actually done this time. I am now scheduled for July 10th and am for some reason significantly less excited than the first time around? I'm kind of just in a ""let's get this over with"" mood and really hoping the excitement comes back after it's been completed. 


Posted a few days ago about thinking I didn't receive my tube removal (bisalp) a week ago and yesterday was on the phone with a nurse from my OBGYN. I asked why my procedure notes didn't include the bisalp and only diagnostics, and if she could confirm that I actually got them removed. She said I got a diagnostic surgery and not a bisalp. I have screenshots of my scheduled surgery being a bisalp AND diagnostic. My surgery consult he agreed to removal, a week after I have messages to and from him asking specifically which type of tubal surgery he was preforming for confirmation and him confirming it was a removal. The nurse told me she will be contacting the surgeon to get me more information but judging by the tone in her voice she seemed to switch over to panic the more questions I asked. Today I got a message back from the doctor telling me that his notes ""were only considering it, but I didn't discuss getting that specifically as a final result"". For lack of a better phrase, I feel as though he is gaslighting me. I have the procedure list that says that we were doing it. If they really screwed something up and completely missed the whole reason for surgery what are my next steps? I'm going to have surgery again. Have to take off work again. Recovery again. Pay again--no way insurance is going to help a second time around. If I didn't notice in my notes and start questioning things I would have been living life like I was sterile. I could have found myself pregnant. I'm at such a loss.

1j0hrkx,legaladvice,Transgender brother is being denied a passport because the gender markers on all his legal documents have been changed.,"For context, we are located in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. My brother and I are college students, and our school has a study abroad requirement. We both applied to get our passports for the first time, since this is our first time traveling abroad. Mine went through but his was put on hold. My brother is transgender (Female to Male) and has undergone the process of changing all of his identifying legal documents, including his driver's license and birth certificate. He also filed a legal name change, so there is virtually no evidence that he was ever female. 

I am unsure how, but the Department of State or whoever is in charge of passports deduced that his birth certificate had been changed. They are now asking for a copy of his birth certificate that reflects his biological sex. The problem is that such a copy does not exist, as it was taken when he got it changed. 

Essentially, they are denying him a passport unless he somehow finds a birth certificate that says 'female' on it. I am also doubtful that doing this would satisfy the requirements, since under the Trump administration, the mismatch would prove that he is transgender and they would continually find reasons to put his passport on hold. I feel like the only option for him is to change all of his gender markers back to female, and we want to avoid this at all costs. What should my family do in this situation?

1i2uetu,legaladvice,Apartment illegally towed my car. Car was given back to the bank as a repo. Do I have grounds for a small claims case for losing my car? (NM),"My car was legally parked in a parking spot at my apartment complex. 
According to my state's towing laws, a tow truck company needs to document proof that a car is illegally parked before towing it. They don't have any proof. My apartment management admitted that they had my car towed because their construction workers wanted to be in that spot (it was just a normal, unmarked parking spot for tenants. There was no signage or other notes/communication on my car before towing it, and it was parked there for less than 24 hours.)

When I called the tow company that took my car, they wanted hundreds of dollars and some copies of documents before I could get my car back. 
A few weeks later, when I had it all, they told me they gave my car to the bank I had my car loan with, and the bank decided to repo it (I was behind one month's payment for my car at the time). 

This is a car that I'd been paying off for a few years already, and I've lost all that I put into it, plus the car itself and my belongings that were in the car. 

Do I have a leg to stand on as far as a civil suit goes?
If yes, what would my damages be able to include?",3809,0.97,3809,0,3931.0,122.0,89,1737048982.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1i2uetu/apartment_illegally_towed_my_car_car_was_given/,False,True
1jbg85p,legaladvice,"Took a client to small claims over a mural they never paid for. I won, they appealed, we went back to court. She submitted ""proof of payment"" but it was for an earlier job I did. Judge ruled in her favor. Can I now take her to court to recoup payment for that first job?","This is in Los Angeles. 

I painted a mural (Project #2) for a client and she never paid me for it. I hounded her for weeks with no luck (I've since discovered this is a recurring issue with her and many other contractors) and I ultimately had to take the matter to small claims. The judge ruled in my favor and tossed out her countersuit, and the client then agreed to a payment plan with me.

However, before she began making payments, she decided to instead appeal the ruling and we went back to court, trial de novo, new judge. This time, she submitted new ""evidence,"" but she submitted it late and I never got to see it or prepare a response for it. The evidence was essentially proof of payments she made to me — however, the payments were for a previous, totally unrelated job (Project #1) I did for her. This time, the new judge ruled in *her* favor, stating that I had clearly been paid.* I wasn't allowed to submit the evidence I had showing that these payments were for a different job and NOT the mural job I had was suing her for. Nor was I not allowed to appeal because I'm the plaintiff, but I did file a request to reconsider the judgement (SC-108). It was immediately denied. 

In short, I'm trying to figure out what my options are now to recoup my funds: 

* **Am I allowed to now sue her for lack of payment for Project #1?** Since she's claiming the funds she paid me for that project were in fact for Project #2? 
* **Is there any penalty I can pursue considering that she knowingly submitted categorically false evidence?** Or would this just mean talking to the judge?  
* I was going to ask about a mechanic's lien but I'm way past the 90-day limit to file unfortunately.

I sued her for a little over $5k. The funds she paid me for Project #1 were barely $2k — so even if the payment was related somehow, it would STILL be short like $3k, which gives me the feeling the judge didn't read any of the documents/evidence I painstakingly assembled/submitted.

*Not sure how relevant this is, but a few months prior, the client tried to file a restraining order against me cus I was up her ass trying to recoup this payment. Her request for a restraining order was denied — the judge who made that ruling is the same judge who ruled in her favor in this trial de novo.",3796,0.99,3796,0,3835.0,39.0,98,1741991307.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jbg85p/took_a_client_to_small_claims_over_a_mural_they/,False,True

1hhmwbh,legaladvice,"Just got a court summons in the mail, because my fiancé called the cops when I overdosed at home.","First off, I live in Arizona. I overdosed in June on Xanax. My fiancé thought I was going to die because I was slow at responding so she called 911. The ambulance took me and a couple hours later I left the hospital. 
It’s been 6 months and today I received a court summons to be at the courthouse January 21st for a misdemeanor paraphernalia charge. (A straw). 

My family are all very upset saying that this is breaking the Good Samaritan law. Which is this: A person who experiences a drug related overdose, who is in need of medical assistance and for whom medical assistance is sought pursuant to subsection A of this section may not be charged or prosecuted for the possession or use of a controlled substance or drug paraphernalia if the evidence for the violation was gained as a result of the person’s overdose and need for medical assistance. 

They found zero drugs, and the only reason they found my straw was because I was in the bathtub when the cops and paramedics were loading me on the stretcher and the cops started opening drawers in the bathroom and went through the trash can, where they located the straw. ( I know this because my fiancé was in the same room freaking out on them for doing this.) 

My question is what should I do?! I’m so worried and have a newborn son so I can’t afford a fancy lawyer or huge fines. Also, it’s now on my background check as pending so I’m probably not going to get this new job. I’m bummed and worried. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1ocurc2,legaladvice,HOA in my neighborhood tells me I'm subject to rules even though I'm not in HOA?,"Hello,

Sorry for formatting, on mobile. Essentially in my neighborhood there are a few houses in the HOA and the majority out. The HOA keeps mailing those not in the HOA 'friendly reminders' about the rules. I emailed them and told them that we are not part of the HOA and to stop sending us letters. They told me that even though I'm not part of the HOA, the owner before me agreed to the rules so I still have to follow them. I think it's a crock of bullshit but they are townhouses so I don't know if there's a stupid bullshit law I'm missing. Copy pasted the email below.

""You are correct.  [your address] is not part of the HOA. Still, there are rules that apply to [your address], as found in the Townhome Rules document.  

The letter I sent was to every homeowner of this community and not just you.
Consistency Across Separate HOAs
To provide context, in 2018, the HOA, by agreement with the Summerhaven Condominiums, crafted the rules and regulations (CC&amp;Rs) to mirror the Condominium Rules and Regulations contained in the Public Offering Statement.  This was so the elements of the Development and Community are consistent despite the separation of the two HOA's.

By mirroring the Condominium Rules and Regulations found in the Public Offering Statement, both the Development and the Community benefit from standardized guidelines, supporting coherence and stability for all residents.

[Previous owner] accepted these restated rules and regulations as applicable to his property - now yours - at [your address]. 
Impact of Rule Deviations on the Community
Any deviation from the established rules and regulations has a direct impact on every homeowner within the community. Such actions can and will undermine the collective integrity and core values that have been set to maintain harmony and consistency throughout the neighborhood. These impacts are both widespread and may be quite significant, definitely affecting every property—your home included.  Adhering to the guidelines, it ensures the preservation of values, standards, and the continued well-being of the entire community.
Attached are the Townhome Rules that pertain to the condominiums of which [your home] is a part.   

Also, see attached, [law firm she uses to bully people] general letter, sent to every property owner on August 25, 2020, in the same manner you received my letter of 10/7/25.

[Neighbor] was one of the first residents of this community and has extensive knowledge of the history of the property, and it might be prudent to speak with her to shed more clarity if you wish.  Amy is most supportive.
 
I trust this is helpful.
 
Sincerely
 
[Nosy old lady]""

The lawyers letter states that the association dissolved but there were rules stated in the dissolution letter. The lawyer's letter also states that the letter isn't reflective of their full rights or legal remedies, but they'll pursue these if need be.

Is this a crock of shit? I'm considering going to everyone not in the HOA and signing a new series of ""rules"", which essentially boils down to ""mind your own business and do not mail your neighbors unless there is legitimate reason"".

Thank you everyone who gave advice. It felt much better to have the ammo in my back pocket. I ended not needing most of it. But the best case scenario is to not have to fire the ammo at all.

  
The problem ended up being solved with just another friendly talk with the senior manager. I insisted on seeing the manger in charge that can make decisions and had a friendly talk with him about how the alarms are bothering the neighborhood across the street. No raised voice, not blaming him for it, and understood that it was a corporate decision but emphasizing that it was disruptive and playing the sound to him several times and asking him to help. He agreed that they were not being a good neighbor and would turn it off. He gave me his direct number and told me to call if it came on again. It only came back on a couple times in the next few weeks, once I got in touch and turned it off soon after, the second time he had his phone on do not disturb and it was on all night but he was apologetic the next day and it has not been on since.

To confirm that, I requested my hospital records and they are missing all the information regarding my son. also they put for the location and patient type n/a. Also my husband spent 400k plus in cash on properties last year. He also took a lump sump; 50k according to him, over seas when we traveled last year.

My issue is how can I find out the details of the settlement and the trust. I contacted the hospital twice and they are unwilling to provide me with details. i looked up the county’s clerk of court and there are no cases under our names.   
how can i prove identity theft? How can i find out the details of the settlement? What type of lawyer should I hire Or is there a way that I can do some digging on my own?

-
• they genuinely do not know his dad is not in the country
-
• they called his name because he is her sponsor
-

Location: Pennsylvania 
Hi everybody,
   
Today, after myself, my boyfriend, and his mother left for work we were informed by our neighbor that 5 ICE agents came to our house yelling my boyfriend’s name. 

My boyfriend is a US citizen (birthright). His mother was originally on a natural disaster visa, but has now been granted her green card as of January. I am a US citizen (native)

Additional context: my boyfriend and his father share the same name, but my boyfriend’s father has not lived in the country for over 20 years. 

As we were not home, we did not answer the door, but we are concerned about the possibility of deportation, especially after hearing everything in the news. We know not to answer the door or speak to them without a warrant.

Is there something that we can do? Do we have anything to worry about ? We are in contact with our immigration lawyer, but he has told us nothing except for “ do not answer the door. “ 

We all work, pay taxes, follow the law, do not own any firearms, or have any criminal record. 

When she went about getting her green card, we did it completely by the book. My boyfriend is his mother’s sponsor.

Please let me know if we should be worried or if it may just be a misunderstanding. Happy to answer any questions you may have. 

ETA:

I understand this is a controversial topic, but I hope you all can understand my concern.

Despite us all having status in good standing, ICE still did visit us. I just want to know what everyone’s thoughts are and if there is anything I should do. Thank you!

1l7sai0,legaladvice,Roped into our neighbors’ search warrant because we live in a duplex. Police seized our iPad only used for art.,"EDIT: y’all, the iPad *is* backed up to the iCloud. I don’t have another *device* for her to use and I cannot afford one rn. Stop lecturing me on the importance of back ups. 

My wife and I live in the upstairs unit of a duplex in Minnesota. The two units have separate house numbers and are independent, aside from a shared entryway, garage, and trash cans. We have our own keys, front doors inside the entryway, mailboxes, electric meters, etc. 

Earlier this week, multiple police officers and a SWAT unit executed a search warrant for the downstairs unit. The warrant was for narcotics and firearms.

At 7 am on the dot, the Minneapolis Police Department showed up with no sirens and blocked off the street on both sides of the house. They then forcibly broke down the shared entryway door, then the downstairs neighbors’ front door, and also the man door to the garage, which actually left a small dent in our car parked inside (not major, but still).

Our front door, the one to our upstairs unit, is the only exterior door that still works in the entire building because I opened it myself when they told us to come up with our hands up. 

They shoved rifles in our faces, cuffed us, and put us in the back of a squad car, where we were for about two hours while they searched both apartments. They uncuffed us about an hour in but we were not allowed to leave the car. 

They initially told us that the warrant was for downstairs (street address 50—not the real number), and asked us repeatedly if we lived there. We said no, we live at 48 and have no connection to the people in 50. We literally just moved here less than six months ago from out of state. The most we interact with the folks in 50 is a “hey how are you?” if we happen to be in the entryway together. 

They asked if the apartments connected at all once inside the respective front doors (they do not). They also asked my wife multiple times if she was a specific downstairs neighbor (she is not). Both my wife and that specific neighbor are black women. 

Then they told us the warrant was for “the entire building” and the garage. Eventually, they printed us a second warrant on the spot that listed our upstairs address, which we only got after the searches were over. We were also directly told by an apologetic sergeant that this had nothing to do with us and we were “just caught in the crossfire.” 

During the search of our unit, which was not as thorough as 50’s, they seized my wife’s iPad. The only thing on this iPad is my wife’s art. Nobody touches this iPad save for my wife, not even me. They left all other electronics untouched, including my own iPad and our laptops. Meanwhile, they took *every single electronic device* from all the folks in 50, including their cellphones and work computers. 

My wife did sign a document allowing them to search the iPad. We were told it could take a month or more if she didn’t, and her art is one of our revenue streams. We can’t afford to be without it for an extended period of time. We did get a receipt. 

We don’t own firearms and don’t use or sell illicit drugs. We are law abiding citizens with nothing to hide. The worst things in our apartment are weed (legal here), blunt prop swords, prescribed medication, and angry cats. All were left unharmed. No arrests were made, so I’m assuming nothing illegal was found downstairs either. 

The whole scene was very overwhelming and frankly a little terrifying, especially with guns pointed at us first thing in the morning.

I’m kicking myself for not paying better attention because the situation feels off to me. I was more worried about making sure the cops didn’t manhandle my wife and knew about our escape artist cat. I’m also disabled, so sitting with my hands cuffed behind me so tightly for so long was not a great experience and I was/am in a lot of pain. 

Was this all on the level? Can they search both units when they are separate like this? Is it normal to print off a new warrant off on the spot? Why only take her iPad and leave everything else while taking everything from downstairs, especially when it has literally nothing to do with anything going on in 50? How can we get it back as soon as possible?

Do we need to get a lawyer? We do not have lawyer money right now and we weren’t charged with anything, so I don’t know how PDs work in that regard. 

I’m keeping an eye on the iPad via FindMy because I don’t know what else to do. This is a completely new situation for both of us; I think we have one speeding ticket between us.

Back in April, I was punched in the face while in a bar. The police were called and the man was charged with battery. The man hired a defense lawyer and was found not guilty (I was called to testify).

Now the man is filing civil charges against me; claiming malicious persecution because I testified in the hearing against him even though he was found not guilty (asking $50,000 for this), and defamation because I later made a post on Facebook talking about the incident and in the post I mentioned he was ""charged with battery"". He is now trying to argue that I am accusing him of a ""serious crime"" and that the statement is false because he was found not guilty of the battery, and is attempting to charge me with defamation per se, even though there were no damages, for $50,000 ($100,000 total).

Is there any case law supporting the idea that no one can talk about the charges brought against you if you are found not guilty of them? 

UPDATE: I hired a defense lawyer.  The plaintiff then, almost immediately, discontinued the lawsuit.

I have spoken to my lawyer (and a few others) regarding a civil suit for the face punching and subsequent frivilous lawsuit, but I have been unable to find a lawyer to take on the case. Since there were no medical bills incurred due to the punch, the only official damages incurred as a result of his actions has been the few hundred dollars I spent getting my defense attorney to review the case, walk through it with me, and send that email. So every lawyer I have spoken to said it will cost more to bring a civil suit than what we would be able to recoup if we won. 

Anyway, thank you everyone for your advice and feedback! It is appreciated!

SECOND UPDATE: The plaintiff discontinued the case as soon as my lawyer threatened to file an anti-slapp suit. As a result, I will not get to recoup my legal fees. But, thankfully, I won't have to deal with this anymore.

I consented to my blood getting drawn for alcohol and drugs, but didn't give consent for the nurse to give my entire history to them.","As I was getting out of my car on the 27th I was confronted by a visibly drunk person for a cigarette. I ignored them and they started throwing punches, I defended myself and he tripped over and another person passing by helped me hold him until the police arrived.

I was asked if I wanted to go the hospital and I said yes, since I got hit in the head and felt doozed. Ambulance was called and I arrived, police wanted my blood to test for alcohol and for drugs and I consented.

A police offer was in the room when the results came back as negative for everything. As a doctor wanted to talk with me alone the police officer left.

Later on as I was leaving I saw the police offer and nurse talking about me. She was telling him my previous procedures and visits at the same hospital, I took out my phone and filmed a 34 second video with my last name mentioned and the exact procedure I had.

From what I understand this is against HIPAA, especially when this has nothing to do with the case as I am the victim in the police report.

Am I correct?

1 camera is overlooking our family room and front door
1 camera is overlooking kitchen, back door, and garage door.
1 camera is the door bell

Father in law has apparently consulted with a lawyer about suing myself and my father (who doesn’t live with us. He lives 1400 miles away and has no access to the cameras or our house) for filming and recording him and his wife without their consent. For example, my wife and I let them watch our daughter who is under 4 years old while my wife and I have our very rare date night.

Father in law has threatened to call my place of work to “ruin me” which I’m not sure how to take that or protect myself from that sort of slander.

Any thoughts and advice are more than welcome. I have contacted a local law firm to get some advice as well.

1jd2ts1,legaladvice,I’m very scared my husband will be charged with a felony and have to go to prison as well as my friend.,"I really need advice from a lawyer who is knowledgeable in this area so that we know what to expect. Right now we are preparing for the worst and are not okay. 

My husband left behind a gun in a rental condo in the state of NY. He didn’t realize until we were two hours away. He tried to call the management office to let them know but had to leave a message. 

The booking was under my friend’s name and contact info. She got a call from the local county police about an hour after we called the management office. The officer stated they would call her back on Wednesday with more information (today is Sunday). 

My husband then called this county police and explained that the gun was his and that our friend had nothing to do with this and that all of the communication about this should be through him since it is his gun. 

He was told the same thing, they will call back on Wednesday.

We are expecting the worst. I’m seeing that this is a class E felony which means he could face a year in prison or a fine. Everything I’m seeing does say “OR” a fine, not both. 

We are so scared that he will have to go to prison for up to a year for this, even any amount of time we are very scared. 

He is very accepting that he broke the law and the likelihood of him being charged with a felony. He has a clean record and has never been in trouble with the law except for speeding tickets (3 total I think?) he feels so so so terrible and understands these are his consequences but we just really are hoping he doesn’t go to jail for this. 

I told him he should probably talk to a lawyer to be prepared for this conversation with the sheriff when they call back on Wednesday and he mentioned waiting until after the conversation to see what they’re gonna tell him. I just really feel like that is a bad idea and I don’t want him to accidentally incriminate himself but he thinks lawyering up will escalate the situation into something worse than if he didn’t. 

So can anyone give guidance on what to expect and/or what we should do next? 

Also, is there any way my friend will also get in legal trouble for this since the booking was in her name? She had nothing to do with this and my husband is taking full accountability for what happened. 

Update:
A lot of people are asking for an update on the situation. My husband is not being charged with anything and his lawyer is contacting a person with an FFL license to pick up the gun in New York and give it to my husband in the neighboring state we reside in.

Last month, it snowed a couple inches overnight and an Amazon delivery driver slipped while walking up my front steps the next morning. I have the incident recorded on video through my Ring camera - I was asleep, as this was early in the morning. Basically, she started to fall but caught herself (without ever actually hitting the ground or anything). She then proceeded to swear at my camera and knock on my door for 5 minutes before walking down my driveway and sitting in her car, where I presume she called 911 because an ambulance showed up afterwards and picked her up.

Today, I got a notice from a personal injury attorney which says they represent her ""in a cause of action asserted against you for injuries sustained on the above date due to your insured negligence or fault"", and that they suggest I ""forward this letter to your insurance carrier immediately"" because ""they will be able to handle this for you""

Am I liable here? Do I need to hire an attorney, or am I supposed to just forward the letter to my homeowner's insurance like it says?

So to give us both some space from each other I have been staying the evenings with a friend of mine after work and coming by and spending weekends and whatever free time I have with the kids.

Well curiosity got the better of me tonight and I checked phone records and turns out they had been talking to each other for months. I came back home tonight and confronted her about it and she basically shut down on me and had her friend come pick her up. 
I know I need to go see a lawyer ASAP as I do not wish to continue this marriage but is there anything else I should do in the meantime?

1hv415s,legaladvice,[IN] Neighbor's 12 year old child keeps running away to my house. She wants me to lock her child out when this happens. Do I have to comply?,"My neighbor adopted a girl several years back (I think when she was 7 or 8) and has been locked in a power struggle with her ever since. It got particularly bad last year, my neighbor would try to confine her to her room and she would break out through the window and run away to neighbors' houses - like mine. The neighbor and I were friends before this started happening, and we even hosted her birthday party at my house one year so the daughter sees my house as a safe and fun place.

The last time this happened, I did what I usually do which is to text the neighbor, tell her that her daughter is safe with me, and that she should come pick her up at her earliest convenience. She responded to me by saying NO, I shouldn't have let her into my house, and that I need to send her to walk home (in the dark) to her own house several blocks away. I refused saying that I didn't feel comfortable sending a young child out in the dark by herself. After a protracted argument she eventually relented and came to pick her up.

Flash forward my neighbor apparently sent her to some kind of facility for the past year, and now the daughter is preparing to return home. In anticipation of a repeat incident, my neighbor sent me a very strongly worded letter saying that I am not to have any contact with her daughter.

They had let him out a few days before Christmas, and he ended up hit by a car crossing the road in front of our house. We spent 1600 getting the cat to live (shocker of a bill for one, first time taking a cat to the ER). With no collar or microchip, we assumed he was a stray.

After the neighbor found out we had been caring for the cat, we returned the him since it was Christmas Day, and the cat belonged to the neighbor's kids. They promised to pay cash when picking him up, but when they showed up they said ""It's Christmas, we don't have any money."" From how they were acting, we weren’t confident they would hold true to their word. Holding the cat hostage until we got the money back seemed like an evil move, so we let him go. We have countless messages going back and forth where they promise to pay, but there's no guarantee of how or when it will happen. Looking back, I should have drafted a contract of some sort before handing the cat back over.

When we saved the cat, we wanted to give him a home and a life that was almost stolen from him... we got attached and suddenly he's gone with 1600 bucks. I've even told them I'll foot 400 and ask for 1200 when they can manage that.

I am fully prepared now if she ever comes by again to ask her to stop visiting us, stay off of our property, and that we may never sell. But based on our interactions so far is there any way this woman could make a claim to our property in the future?

So my daughter was seeing a therapist at a local library. Her sessions would be done in one of two private rooms at the back of the library. Did two sessions. Everything was fine. 

The third session, we showed up 10 minutes early and the therapist wasn’t there yet. We then waited at the front of the library. My wife then received a text message that the therapist was running late. We waited 45 minutes and I then texted the therapist where she was? She said she was already there and didn’t see us, so she left. I told her that we had been there the whole time, never saw her and told her to come back. She then text my wife I was rude and refused to come to the library. I then fired her.

Two weeks later, we get a bill for the first two sessions and the third that we never got service for. I paid the first two sessions and sent her a letter addressing why we were not going to pay for the third. Now a debt collector is calling my wife for $237. What are our options? Thank you guys in advance for any advice.

Edit: I filed a complaint with my insurance company, but they have no record yet of the therapist filing a claim with them. Odd. I also filed a complaint with the Division of Public Health
Office of Professional &amp; Occupational Investigations. 

Second Edit: Wife got home from work and we called the number that the debt collector called from. It went to an answering service for some sort of voucher card. We looked the number on Google and it said it was a robo call number. The guy who spoke to my wife had a thick Indian accent, but he named this therapist’s branch office and had the correct amount that we “owed” to this therapist, plus other fees, so it was $200-something.

1os1cd8,legaladvice,I was stopped and told to leave a neighborhood by private security while on a run.,"Location: Austin, Texas, United States. 

Please read the whole thing or the TLDR before jumping to conclusions. 

TL;DR: I was stopped and given a hard time by a private security company, while running on a public road. 

I’m a runner, mostly as a hobby, but it’s a free and easy to stay in shape. I run a few times a week. Generally just down the main road, then dip into random off streets and developments. 

Friday I ran a bit further than usual for marathon prep, and into a new development via some kind of side entrance of another development. Nice area, like REALLY nice area. I checked my map and decided I just wanted to run up, loop, and come back down and onto the next neighborhood. 

I had noticed LPRs and other cameras on the corner where I had come into this neighborhood, I thought nothing of it since they’re everywhere. But it wasn’t that normal brand we always see around. Whatever, a lot of HOAs do that stuff. 

I had gotten just over a mile in, and was working my way back out to the main road when I was approached by some private security vehicle. I was greeted kindly by the guy who was in a typical security uniform. He asked how my run was going. Then he asked me to display my resident ID. Obviously I don’t have one. I don’t live there. So I just told him exactly that. “I don’t live here, I’m just on a run”

Well, he didn’t like that. He pulled his security car a little too close to me and he firmly told me I had to leave or I would get trespassed, and that this was a private community. So fine whatever, I was already working my way out. So I said sorry I didn’t realize, and told him I was leaving anyhow. 

He then proceeded to follow me the whole way to where I left the development. 

I thought the whole interaction was odd and out of the ordinary. Didn’t see any signs when I was running, and the whole development doesn’t have a gate. Plus I saw people driving in and out of that side road, and the main road with zero issue. Didn’t seem private to me. 

So, when I got home I looked into where I was running. It’s a very expensive neighborhood. They have security, and a sign at the MAIN entrance that says “private property - no trespassing” well oops, that wasn’t at the side entrance. 

I dove into the county GIS data as well as their road map that shows which roads are public dedicated/maintained. Turns out, all of the roads in the neighborhood are public access and owned by the county itself. Just like any other road. So anyone can use them. 

I called the county office, which was surprisingly helpful, and they confirmed that yes all of the roads in the community are owned by the county, and open to the public. Turns out there’s even greenways in there that the general public can use. 

So, it seems like this community has that no trespassing sign, and security guards as some kind of bluff to keep people out and deter crime. I also assume those LPRs are also some kind of security measure that alerted that guard that I had run into the community. 

My legal question, did this security guard do something illegal by giving me a hard time for running on a public road? AFAIK; it would be Official Suppression. 

I’d love to run there again, it was a nice area. Especially if there are nice public trails that my tax dollars are funding. So, assuming I can based off of what I had found, and the county itself saying I was in the right. What’s the best way to tell their mall cops to pound sand?  

I don’t feel the need to put in the effort to elevate things right now. But if I am given a hard time again, might as well put the mall cop in his place. 

How would you handle this?

So, lots going on in regards to this case. Was originally going to court for child support against my child’s father brought on by the state because my child is on Medicaid. This evolved into a protection order + child custody due to erratic and unsafe behavior from child’s father. After being served the protection order - my child’s father sent my old nudes (from like 5 years ago) out to friends, family and coworkers. There is an active investigation in regards to this (pending phone carrier subpoena according to investigator). Anyways - we have court for the protection order in 2 days, and court for child support in 5 days - I was just informed that he also sent the nudes to the county attorney on our child support case 😭. My lawyer said the county attorney was not pleased. What kind of consequences will my child’s father receive from the county attorney/judge in regards to sending these nudes of me to the county attorney? It is the same judge on the protection order - child support - and custody cases. So will this also impact all of our cases going forward?

A friend of mine has recently entered a relationship with an individual on the Michigan Sex Offender Registry.

He claims that a 14 year old female coworker started to pursue him, then falsely accused him of SA in retaliation when he turned her down because of her age. The way he describes it, all it takes to get charged with CSC and put on the sex offender registry in Michigan is the word of the victim, no other proof or witness is required, and because he had no money for a lawyer, he had no choice but to accept the plea deal.

To get to the point, the reason why it happened is because of a citation a middle school police officer gave me when I was about 12. I was walking home from school with friends and we stopped to hang around a stop sign where we were repeatedly jumping and hitting it for fun. Some teacher happened to drive by as we were doing this and saw me being the last one to reach up to the stop sign, she put her window down and yelled at me to stop so I did and walked away. Hours later our middle school police officer shows up to my house saying that he got a call from the teacher that I was vandalizing the stop sign, and he was claiming that I had wrote “Norte” (a gang) on the stop sign because that’s what he saw when he reportedly went up to the sign. He wouldn’t leave my home until I forcefully confessed something. I explained to him what really happened but he told me he was just going to do his job and gave me a citation. I don’t even remember if I was required to sign anything. It legit went in the system, my record, everything. There was no follow up or any fines and as I grew up it was a memory I completely blocked out because everything happened so quickly and was never brought up again (Hence why I didn’t remember to talk about this situation to the job). But now that i’m looking back into it, I was basically accused of vandalism and gang affiliation with the only evidence being a teacher saw me under a stop sign, there was no investigation into whether I really did it or not it seems like the officer just took the teacher’s statement and ran with it and gave me something that stains my record permanently. Is there any legal action I can take in any way shape or form?

A good Samaritan called 911 for me and I got picked up to the nearest hospital. Since my flight back was that day, I asked the doctors not to do any procedures on me and to just patch me up and let me go.  That’s exactly what happened. I got a sling for my arm, some medication (which I paid for) and I  also got an x-ray for my arm. After all that a nurse took my information, they took a copy of my ID and I sent them via email my medical insurance. After all that I was let go.

A couple days later I was in the hospital in Mexico and I received an email for an invoice for the x-rays  which was about $30 this was more than OK with me, but today I received another invoice for almost $4000. I noticed that in the invoice it’s not addressed to my full name (missing middle name) and it has an address for New York and at random phone number, which is not mine.

This might be a problem for the insurance company since all the documents I have to provide need to have the same information so I’m worried the insurance might not cover this amount.

This is my dilemma, the $4000 charge is almost unpayable for me so I’m wondering what would be the consequences if I don’t pay. I don’t want to get my visa removed. Should I call the hospital and see what I can do? Has anyone encountered a similar issue?

1liruwx,legaladvice,(MI) Fired from my job after putting in my 2 weeks and boss is demanding my property in exchange for paycheck,"Location: Michigan, USA

Hi everyone,

Up until two weeks ago, I was working for a franchise for 2.5 years as a manager. Due to scheduling conflicts with my schooling, I decided to find a different job. I put in my two weeks' notice on June 5th, and everything seemed fine. I posted one shift for grabs because I needed that day for a mandatory drug screening for my new position. This was the only time I had ever done that while I worked there.

Then, on the 11th, I went into work and found the owner there. He immediately started berating me and fired me. I remained civil and just said okay, but he continued to get more aggressive and insult me. He then stated that he would not give me my final paycheck until I returned my manager shirts. The problem is that I paid for those shirts 100% and have the receipts. In my eyes, he has no claim to them, and withholding my earned money for my property seems unfair.

I’m unsure of what to do in this situation or if there’s anything I can do. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

  
Edit: The shirts were polos and were overpriced because they were sold by the franchise. Which is why I don't want to give them to him; they have my name on them. Additionally, there was no valid reason for my termination, yet they are telling everyone that I kept putting my shifts up for grabs and that I was a poor worker. I meant to mention this earlier, but there has been so much drama that I forgot.

We have a very passive aggressive and entitled neighbor that we’ve been having issues with for the 7 years we’ve lived in our house. Our yards face eachother and are separated by a 6ft wooden fence. 

He calls the 911 on us for everything - if we use our fire pit at all he calls and reports a fire.  If we have friends out in the yard or music playing he calls for noise. Every time the police come they agree with us that he is being a jerk because we aren’t doing anything wrong. 

Recently he’s gotten especially brazen and actually entered our yard while we weren’t home and moved a ladder that we had against our fence because he could see it from his yard. The fence was zip tied to the fence so it wouldn’t fall over during upcoming storms and he actually came in the yard and moved it and replaced the zip ties. This was within the same week of him calling the police on us for using the fire pit (again). 

We placed no trespassing signs on poles along our fence line (but in his view from his yard) so he would get the point. Instead - he sent us a certified cease and desist letter accusing us of ruining the air quality (using the (firepit), posting threatening signs (no trespassing-violators will be prosecuted), and ruining the aesthetics of his yard.

A few months ago my car was hit by a motorcycle. I was treated for minor injuries on the scene, but the motorcyclist was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. I called 911 immediately and helped paramedics assist the motorcyclist as best as I could. I was very cooperative with police, sober, and voluntarily submitted to a breathalyzer test to verify. The motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet, and the force of the crash was enough to blow apart my entire engine block, totaling the vehicle.

The lead investigator said they would [most likely] not be filing any criminal charges, that the motorcyclist was out bar hopping before the accident, but that an autopsy will take months to determine if/how intoxicated they were. I am also waiting on the accident reconstruction team to finalize their report, which I assume will determine fault.

I found out that the estate of the deceased has hired a wrongful death attorney and will be pursuing damages “in excess of my insurance policy” ($100k). What are the chances of them taking this to trial and winning, especially if it’s determined that the other driver was well over the legal limit?

I am not in a position to afford a lawyer at the moment, but don’t want to end up losing all my assets if I am somehow determined to be partially at fault for the accident. I’d rather take out a loan if it meant saving tons of money in the long run, but don’t want to carry that burden if the likelihood is extremely low that they’d not just reach a settlement for less than $100k.

1hpyuul,legaladvice,Filed a complaint with MIOSHA and my manager is trying to find out who did it.,"I work in Michigan at a privately owned veterinary hospital. Recently, my manager decided to take our break room and turn it into an office. This left our food being stored in the treatment room and being exposed to bodily fluids like urine, blood, etc. 

Several people in my office told her we didn't need to do this and we can't store food there but she didn't listen to us. So I filed a complaint anonymously.

She has been threatening us since she found out. Pulling us all aside and asking us if we did it, telling us she has a call into MIOSHA to find out who did it and that when she finds out we will be in trouble. Today she held a staff meeting to say that she always intended to have food storage in the office and the complaint was a lie. She said she spoke with attorneys and they told her she has a right to know who filed the complaint and that the can face jail time and fines for lying to MIOSHA. She said that after the first year she will know who filed the complaint, because MIOSHA will tell her, and we will be in trouble.

Can she do this? Can she get my name from MIOSHA through a phone call? I am seriously worried for my job at this point. I am worried she is going to retaliate and continue to make my complaint look like a lie. I absolutely was not but I am worried she will continue to stretch the truth.",3071,0.99,3071,0,3102.0,31.0,57,1735596297.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hpyuul/filed_a_complaint_with_miosha_and_my_manager_is/,False,True

1ipfaro,legaladvice,"Chase Bank Closed My Account, Took My Money, and Left Me Stranded—Now They Won’t Give It Back","(Long post, but this has been an insane process. Thanks in advance to everyone offering helpful advice—I truly appreciate it!)

On December 22nd, Chase shut down my account for “suspicious activity” without warning. Before that, they did call me about one major transaction—I confirmed it was legit, and they let it go through. After that, I only transferred money between my own Chase accounts (savings to checking)—no external transfers. Then, without notice, they closed my account entirely.

They told me I’d receive a check for my remaining balance in 7–10 business days. That never happened.

The Endless Runaround Begins

On January 14th, I called, and they said my check was mailed on January 2nd after delays. Two days later, I called again—suddenly, the check wasn’t sent because it was still “pending verification.” Every rep I spoke with guaranteed me different broken promises with no resolution.

At one point, a rep told me Chase had no way of contacting their back office—so no one could explain what was actually happening. After my account was closed, customer service told me to go into a branch to verify my identity. I did—while on vacation—only for the branch to say, “No, customer service has to verify it.” Another dead end.

When I got home, I went into another branch, where the branch manager told me “a veteran is going around cashing in checks,” implying fraud. I personally asked, “Are you sure?” He was. Then he gave me the same number I’d already been calling for updates. I followed up, only for Chase to deny my claim again.

Finally, Someone Actually Helps

I went to a different branch, where the manager actually took my case seriously. He told me the VA needed to send a document confirming I was the intended recipient of my own money. So I sat in the parking lot, waiting until I got exactly what they asked for.

When I went back inside with the document, he gave me the same line I’d been hearing this entire time—telling me to “give it an hour.” I waited a full day instead.

I called back, and they told me verification went through, and that my checks were on the way:
	•	Savings balance: 1 business day
	•	Checking balance: 7–10 business days

I never received the first check, so I waited for the second one. That one never came either.

Chase’s Last-Second Excuse—And the IRS for Some Reason?

I called again. This time, they said they couldn’t verify paper documents (even though it was a PDF, not paper). Then, out of nowhere, they put me on a three-way call with the IRS. No idea why.

After I explained my situation again, the IRS rep immediately said, “Not our problem, it’s the VA.” So I got transferred to the VA, where I had to explain everything again—only to be told that the document had already been sent, and Chase had already denied it.

The VA rep also found this weird and escalated it to a supervisor. When I explained everything to her (with the Chase rep still on the line), she confirmed my check had already been mailed.

Then, the Chase rep interrupted her—asking for the check number. She couldn’t provide it on a three-way call, and he pushed again with no result. Finally, he accepted her verification and told me the account would be unfrozen and my funds released in 3–5 business days.

Finally, Some Movement—But I’m Not Letting This Go

Shortly after filing my CFPB complaint, Chase called me directly and said they were resolving the issue. However, I’m still pushing for: Immediate release of my funds, Compensation for the financial hardship they caused during my vacation, A legitimate reason for why my account was closed, A formal apology, Correction of any damage to my financial reputation caused by their actions

News Agencies Are Taking Interest

I’ve been contacted by a news agency about this, so I may share more soon.

Final Thoughts

This situation was completely absurd. I did everything right—called, went into branches, followed their instructions, and even got the VA and IRS involved. None of this should have happened.

For those wondering, I was on top of this from the start—taking notes and recording calls—but after a while, it just got overwhelming. I also fully understood the privacy policies throughout this whole process and documented every step.

If your comment doesn’t actually help, please just keep it to yourself. Huge thanks to everyone offering genuine advice—I truly appreciate it!

1hdcec6,legaladvice,"I fell 10 minutes after an outpatient procedure, three feet from the office door, and was severely injured. Do I have a case?","I had a vasectomy yesterday morning using only local anesthetic. When my urologist finished he told me to get dressed and hit a call button for someone to give me my after-care handout and they would lead me out. He left the room right away. I felt fine so I did as he instructed, was handed a couple forms about future testing, and was shown the door by staff, walked out to the lobby, got my wife and our baby and left the office immediately. As soon as we left the office and were waiting for the elevator outside (we were on the second floor of a medical building attached to a hospital) I lost consciousness and fell on my face. 

When I came to, the office staff got me a wheel chair and took me to the emergency department in the adjacent hospital where I got a CT and they determined I needed to be transferred 120 miles to a specialist.

My jaw is dislocated on both sides and fractured in five places. I lost one tooth so far, may lose others in surgery later this morning, and at least one eye tooth is broken in half with that piece imbedded in my lip. My jaw may be wired shut for up to six weeks if they can’t get to all of the fractures with plates and screes and I am certainly on a liquid diet at least that long.

Is my urologist or his practice (a corporate surgical practice) at all liable for my injury? A few hours after my fall he came to see me in the ED and introduced himself to my nurse as “I’m the one who did that to him”. I like the guy, I know this was an accident, but I remodel homes with a friend and will be out of work for a long time. I’m already on SNAP and Medicaid and my wife is on SSA disability following a kidney transplant three years ago.

1mrz8ut,legaladvice,"I purchased a home. Seller is 97. Her daughter with power of attorney moved her out but left behind 30 labor hours worth of belongings, garbage, and junk removal. Contract says ""broom clean.""","Location: Ohio. They lived in the house since 1953. The owner, being 97, had a lot of accessibility needs. On the contract, they were staying 12 days beyond close at a daily rate, which they paid through closing costs, to give them ample time to set up her new home and safely move her from her previous. When I did my final walkthrough, they were still living in the home, and her daughter ensured me it'd be clean.  They ended up moving out a week early by leaving a key in a lockbox.

The basement was floor to ceiling with old, moldy boxes and rotten junk. Food in the fridge and shampoo in the shower. Pictures were left on the walls. Broken furniture left behind like end tables or cracked glass patio tables which needed bulk removal. This is my first home.

I have the number of the owner's daughter from the initial closing ""just in case they get any mail or packages"" to text her. I texted her requesting she either come back since they moved out early and finish cleaning the home to ""broom clean"", or compensate me for the labor to get it in line with the contract. She told me to pound sand, and she didn't owe us anything because it was kind of her to leave early. She hasn't responded to me since.

Friends and I took snow shovels, rented a dumpster, hired cleaners for the essentials once it was completely empty (mopping, dusting, counters, mildew removal from the showers and fridge). It took about 30 hours. I ran these numbers among three separate local quotes for cleaning/junk removal and the ledger works out to about $2000.

I want to take this to small claims court for my time, but I have concerns. The 97 year old's name is on the contract, not her daughter's. This was not the 97 year old's fault and I would feel awful going after her. Everything online says POA does not affect small claims court and I cannot realistically afford a lawyer for a $2000 case. Even if I wanted to take her daughter to small claims, I don't have anyone's address since she isn't replying to me. My realtor is beyond useless and is not replying to me - she was incredibly hard to reach even when buying a house.

Can I even take the daughter to small claims since it's not her name on the contract? It was her responsibility to fulfill it as POA. Also, what do you do when the other party is not receptive to providing the needed information? Who else can I go through, such as maybe their realtor?

I really can't believe this is happening. 

My friend started a new company. I decided to invest $50,000 in that company because she's a great long term friend and I really believe in her.

We set up a contact (being friends is nice, but doing things right is important). I wrote her a check (to the benefit of her new company, not her by name).

She deposited the check in her new bank account, along with other funds she transferred from her own account. 

The money left my account, but Chase wouldn't release it to hers.

After many days of back and forth with her bank, she found out her new account was put on hold and set to be closed. 

The reason? They couldn't reach me by phone to verify the validity of the check. To be fair - I don't currently live in the US (I do have a US phone number, but it's a Skype number)

**Edit: to be clear, the check is from my American bank account. I live abroad, but still have an American bank account and several American credit cards**

I went with my friend to her Chase branch (yes, I flew in just for that. It was expensive - over $3000), brought multiple IDs, proof of ownership of my bank account (the one from the check), our contract, and even my Chase credit cards. 

We wanted to verify in person that I really am the one who wrote the check and it's all good. 

They said they can't verify me in person, they can only verify me via a verified phone number. And apparently they don't have my phone number in the system they use for verification (even though it's the phone number on my Chase credit card account!)

They said there's nothing else they can do, and the account will be closed. 



We asked them what happens to my money - will they return it to my account? What happens to it? The bank manager said that they will keep the money for several years (!!!) and probably return it then. 

The account is now closed.

Luckily, all other funds except for my $50,000 were able to be retrieved. She managed to find another investor to replace me. She's using her personal bank account, but my friend's company is alive and well. 

The question is - what can I do to get my money back from Chase? 

I tried talking to my bank's fraud department, they said that since I actually did write the check and the intended recipient actually deposited it in their account, and the money is already in Chase's hands, there's nothing they can do and I must talk to Chase.

As for Chase, the account is now closed so we can't see the money anymore.

So what are my / our options? Can I sue them? How? Is there any other avenue to get my money back?

1knp323,legaladvice,Defense attorney called me (juror) a week after my jury ruled against client,"Location: Central Virginia

I’m in my 20s, and this was my first time as a juror. I was also voted the foreman. It was a medical malpractice case. We ended up ruling against the defendant. After the ruling was read, the defense attorneys even requested that each juror be polled to make sure we were all in agreement. (Came off like they didn’t believe we could possibly rule against them, but I know they were just doing their job)

Today, I received a call on my work phone and ignored it (because I didn’t know the number). A few hours later I saw that I had a message, and it said “Hi, this message is for __(me)__. This is ___(defense attorney)__, one of the defense attorneys from the trial the other week. Give me a call back when you get a chance at ____(number)___. Thanks.”

First off, I’m confused how this attorney got my work cell number since it wasn’t listed in my juror information (I checked the portal online to confirm). I also just don’t give out that number.

Secondly, it also feels kind of inappropriate. I just ruled against your client a week ago after a very complex, stressful trial. We deliberated for 6 hours straight and even effectively testified to our agreement with the ruling. I just want to put this behind me cuz it wasn’t a pleasant case to be a part of.

What I’m wondering is: Is this normal practice? Should I call back? Is it something worth calling the court over to understand my rights/whether this is abnormal?

Ultimately, I may just ignore it because I have no interest in re-litigating this case to a firm I already ruled against, but any insight would be appreciated! :)

(More like 12 because the mail took a week to actually arrive at our house)

The issue is, when we found the case number online it says he was served the summons on 11/8. This is impossible because he was in the hospital at the time (we have proof through medical records) . I'm the only other person at our house and there weren't any papers delivered. 

What do we do?? How do we protect our home? What kind of lawyer do we need to fight this? And why didn't we get the chance to defend ourselves before this got judged?

Small Update: We have retained an attorney, sent in the exemption request, and are going to be having a hearing to get this whole thing dismissed! Thank you all so much!

Pretty much what the title says… her grandmother took out this term life policy when she was 11 and we recently took over the payments on it. Got a financial advisor and he looked over the yearly statement and told us that she’s been listed as an avid tobacco user from the start of the policy which likely cost us more than double on the premium, accrued less cash value, and potentially prevented better coverage for a similar rate. This policy has been in effect for over 15 years so this isn’t just a simple mistake. The sales rep that sold the policy is trying every trick under the sun to try to keep the policy from being canceled. We’re canceling the policy as soon as humanly possible but wondering if it’s worth seeking a lawyer to get some sort of compensation.

1iygwxk,legaladvice,Wife was accused of kidnapping and wrongfully detained by immigration upon arrival to airport with 1 year old son.,"During a return flight from Morelia to Los Angeles on Volaris Airlines. My wife traveling with our infant child was unjustly accused by the flight crew of kidnapping. The crew's suspicion of my wife not being my sons mother stemmed from my sons fussiness during the flight, despite my wife’s efforts to console him. Upon landing, she was escorted off the plane by a flight attendant and detained by immigration officials. She was placed in a holding area to be interrogated with suspected criminals while trying to prove our son's identity. The experience has left her traumatized and fearful of flying with our son in the future. Do we have a case to pursue legal action for damages?

To confirm. My wife had all proper documentation before traveling for our son (Passport ID, birth certificate and notarized letter signed) and those documents were verified by the airline personnel before boarding the plane during check in. The situation felt like my wife was targeted and profiled which is why the incident upon landing came as a shock and was traumatizing.",2860,0.93,2860,0,3093.0,233.0,121,1740550075.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1iygwxk/wife_was_accused_of_kidnapping_and_wrongfully/,False,True

Another kid was swinging a lunchbox with a metal water bottle attached in a crowded hallway.

It wasn't intentional, but should I ask the boy's parents to help pay for this?  Or the school?  Im already putting two daughters through college and can't afford this.

Update: verdict from the dentist.  The chipped lower tooth could not be reconstructed because the upper teeth are bashed in and contacting the chipped tooth when he bites.  The upper teeth cannot be pushed back out because that risks killing the upper teeth.  Dentist recommends letting the upper teeth heal for 3 or 6 months and then working with an orthodontist.

1hquxnq,legaladvice,"I have a third-party's vending machines in my business that I've requested to be removed, and the owner is refusing to do so.","A few months back, we had a customer offer to bring in some vending machines to our facility. He said he would take care of the installation and all upfront costs, plus maintenance and restocking. We, in turn, agreed to take only 10% of sales, and he would take the other 90%. We have no formal contract in place. This was all verbal agreement. This is not another company I am working with; it is simply just some person who has acquired a handful of vending machines and is looking to make a few extra dollars.

I reached out to him to let him know we would like to remove them because we now have plans for the space they occupy, and they have not been as popular as we had hoped. At this point, they make just enough to cover the cost they add to our electric bill. I told him there was no rush to do this immediately and that we could keep them in place for several weeks before they became too cumbersome to store within our new floor layout.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
He's informed me that he would not be removing them, and we can either purchase them from him or keep them with the same verbal agreement we have in place. Me and my business partners have agreed to meet up with him in person to discuss this further, which will be our last opportunity to solve this peacefully; so far I have just had a one-on-one phone conversation with him that went poorly. I'd really like to solve this amicably because he's been a customer of ours for over a decade, and we have a good relationship. However, what are my options if he becomes unreasonable about this?

I called the Social Security Office and am currently waiting for a call back. Am I now doomed to a life of difficulty proving my identity? Will this be difficult to amend or will I be able to solve it with a quick phone call?

I made an account with the SSA and found that they have record of my earnings from my taxes starting in 2021. That's a bit of a relief, I guess?

1m4btyd,legaladvice,Mom listing my inherited house under her name,"My (18m) dad passed away around a decade ago, and, since he and my mother were divorced, I am set to inherit his house. Currently, my mom, aunt, and I are going through different legal stuff in order to ultimately sell the house. That house is a big safety net for me in case I get kicked out or disowned suddenly, which is a very likely possibility in the future.

I am worried my mom is trying to take control of the property, especially since my aunt called me today and told me that my mom had listed the house (which hasn't been relinquished from the state to me yet) in her name. She was worried about the same thing happening, especially since my mom had mentioned offhandedly things about buying a house or reinvesting the money from my house into her portfolio. Which, as much as I love my mom, being cut off from my safety net is like top ten things that I don't want to happen.

We have been discussing reinvesting the money into another house because the tax that would be put on the capital gain otherwise would be too much, and that is something I am generally on board with. Is there any way for me to just ensure that I am legally acknowledged as the owner of whatever asset comes out of this ordeal?

1mhrx40,legaladvice,I signed the “Mama Bear” documents. Can I get out of them?,"Location: Virginia

Hi! I know a post of a similar topic was posted yesterday, but the comments are now turned off, and I have an urgent question.

In the post of interest, OP was strongly urged not to sign “Mama Bear” documents presented by a parent before going off to college. I’m a rising college sophomore, and I signed the documents in question almost a year ago (one set for Virginia, my home state, and one set for Connecticut, where my college is). But, after reading that post, I wish I hadn’t signed those documents.

I know signing them without doing research was dumb. I don’t know why I did it. Maybe it was because my mom presented them so matter-of-factly, I assumed it was something everyone did, like filling out the FAFSA. But, in hindsight, I do have parents who like to helicopter, and I am seeking to gradually decrease contact with them over the years (though they may not fully realize that part, it does anger them when I try to live more independently).

1ng6i8x,legaladvice,Can I be sued for serving a child a food they had a life-threatening allergy to?,"I am an employee for a food stall that gives out free samples of our products. A mother and child approached and were interested in sampling. I handed the mother our product sheet, which lists all of our foods and their main ingredients, including major allergens present in each food. At no point did the mother or child state anything about an allergy, let alone a life-threatening one.

The child asked for a sample of a particular product that contained nuts, and I gave it to the child. After discussing the product more, it came out that there were nuts in the product and immediately both the mother and child panicked and said that the kid was allergic to nuts. I apologized profusely, but they ended up leaving and the mother gave some medication to mitigate the reaction (which sounded like swelling and itching). As far as I know, the child did not go to the hospital.

Later the mother complained to my supervisor that she had disclosed the allergy and I had still given her kid something containing nuts. But this is not true!! The word “allergy” never came up and the mother had the full list of ingredients right in front of her. Usually customers will disclose allergies very clearly before beginning to sample, and I will give verbal confirmation that we are avoiding nuts or dairy or whatever the allergy is. No such exchange occurred in this case. In fact, if a customer specifies their allergy is severe or life threatening, I will usually advise them not to sample as there is a risk of cross contamination. My coworker who was there agrees that I wasn’t informed, and can corroborate my story.

Would the mother have any legal recourse to sue or could I get in any legal trouble for this incident? I feel terrible, but I didn’t know this child had a life threatening allergy and don’t feel that it’s my responsibility to check ahead of time for every product with every customer. But I don’t know what the law says about it.

Location: USA

EDIT FOR CLARITY: The child requested the sample by pointing at the physical sample, which only had a label with the name. The name of this product didn’t indicate that there were nuts in it. But the product sheet held by the mom had all of the ingredients of every product listed, including the one the child had a reaction to. They also had each requested several samples before this one, and never asked if any of them contained nuts. I think the mom was just assuming based on the names (since some of our products do have “nut” in the name).",2735,0.97,2735,0,2822.0,87.0,246,1757791818.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ng6i8x/can_i_be_sued_for_serving_a_child_a_food_they_had/,False,True

1naitvi,legaladvice,"Solar company demanding $20K after I bought house with ""paid off"" panels","**Location: Florida**

Hi everyone,

I recently bought a foreclosed house in Florida that was advertised in the MLS as having ""paid off solar panels."" The property was bank-owned, and title insurance came back clean during closing.

**The Problem:**  
After closing, I contacted the solar company to transfer service to my name, only to discover the system isn't actually paid off. This was completely news to me - I factored having a paid-off solar system into my purchase decision.

**Current Situation:**

* The solar company claims the panels are personal property and they still own them (not cleared in foreclosure)
* They're offering me two options: take over payments or pay a lump sum
* I don't want either option - I expected a paid-off system as advertised

**Where Things Stand:**

* Seller's realtor has been copied on emails but hasn't responded
* My realtor has been very helpful throughout this mess
* Filed a title insurance claim. They have been slow (almost 8 weeks with minimal updates )
* Solar company asking me how I want to proceed
* I've stopped communicating with them directly and told the title agent to handle it (title agent originally was telling me to contact them)

**My Questions:**  
Is my only option to wait and see what happens with title? Should title insurance cover this, or is this the seller's responsibility?

Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated. Thanks!

  
edit: lot of commenters suggesting to replace inverter. I agree this would have the solar system working. however that would not stop the current solar company from coming after the panels. I want the bank (seller) to pay it off as they advertised the house as having paid off solar panels in MLS description.

My grandmother has an account with Citibank for over a decade. It's a joint account with her and one of her daughters. Last year, another woman was added to the account. We do not know this woman. My grandmother gets digital statements and she didn't check them, so she didn't realize the person was added.

Fast forward to the end of July, she was logging into her account to find that it was blocked. She called the bank, they told her she has to go in person to see what happened. She went in person. The first time, they said they can't contact legal because they aren't opened. The second time, the bank employee said she needs to figure out who in her account owes debt and who was forwarded to collections.

One of her daughters (who was not on the account) has a similar name to the person that was added to the account. However, the person added has a different social security number as well as a different address. (We got her address because CITIBANK sent a letter to my grandmother with the woman's information as well as her address and the date of the court hearing where judgement was granted against this woman by the company that sued her). So there was a court case!!! We know nothing of this! 

So my grandmother and the daughter with the similar name went to the bank to prove she was not the one added to the account and provided her social security number and address. The bank employee verified that person who was added was not the same person, standing infront of them based on the social security number. 

Now, they are saying, we need to contact the collections company and their lawyer to see what they can do. Why would we have to contact them when CITIBANK was the one who added a total stranger to a primary account without the primary owner even being there or given permission? We do not know what to do. $6000 is a lot to lose. We are not rich.

My mom swears my daughter didn’t cry or breathe until 2:54 minutes after she came out. We have videos of doctors talking in the background and of her looking lifeless when she came out. My baby also had bruising and swelling all over her, specifically on her chest (where you would do cpr) and fingerprint bruises all over her sides and ribs. Was hooked up to oxygen all sorts of stuff. 

Two days later at the hospital a new dr. Came in and was looking at my chart and said “oh they had to do resuscitative measures” which they never told us before. They also told me my baby was rh+ meaning out blood types didn’t mix and they were going to send her out to a specialist for a blood transfusion we signed paper to send her off and last minute they decided not to and wouldn’t give us a reason other than “her test was better”. 
After finally leaving the hospital after over a week I had to return to the hospital bc I had a head ache. Turns out it postpartum preeclampsia, so I’m admitted with 210 blood pressure at risk of a stroke or seizure. 

A week later I’m at my post-op and my doctor tells me there’s absolutely nothing in my chart about my experiences there. Literally all it says is “Easy delivery with jaundice”.

I am also concerned about my mom forging my signature as well as getting it notarized without my consent (her friend is a notary and does he favors frequently). My question is how should I go about preventing her from doing anything against my will?

1oahyio,legaladvice,My gf partially owns a house and wants to sell but there is a lifetime resident who wants to sell it on their own without her.,"Location: Kentucky 
My girlfriend has 1/3rd ownership of a house that she acquired through a will. In the will her aunt was listed as having a life estate, but NOT an owner. My girlfriend was living in the house up until about a year ago, since then no one has lived in the house and she has been behind quite a bit in property taxes. She wants to sell the house with the other owners, but her aunt (lifetime resident) ALSO wants to sell the house on her own independently of my gf and the other owners. We have reason to believe she wants to claim the property has been abandoned. This situation is really confusing and I’m just looking to get some basic advice on what steps we should take, or just in general know how screwed my gf is in this situation. 

Small update: my gf has been trying to get in touch with the other two owners so she can get them on the same page about finding a good lawyer to help with the situation.

Other info that I wasn’t super clear about: The property was acquired about 5 years ago. My gf, her brother, and their cousin are the owners of the property. The aunt hasn’t lived there in sometime over 2 years. My gf was the only one who paid taxes, but is behind on taxes because she has been unable to afford paying.

He sent a picture after he finished, and i immediately noticed it was my neighbor’s driveway, not mine. When i told him my house was the one next door, he told me it’d cost another 50 on top of the 60 i had already paid him and that he had done the work for the address i gave him. I doubled checked to make sure i sent him the correct address, which i did. I told him i would not be paying the extra and unless he did the correct driveway, i wouldn’t be paying him at all. I did not get a response, but hours later i heard from my neighbor. He had came to their door and said they had to pay him for his service. They refused as they had no idea who he even was and he threatened to sue them and myself for unpaid services. Oh, and he never did my driveway.

This assault has taken many forms, including rescinding existing grants to academics, proposing dramatic cuts in future funding budgets, unilateral and extreme changes to parts of budgets like ""indirect cost rates"", and massive and indiscriminate firings of federal scientists. These efforts that if successful, will hobble not just scientific research – and universities more broadly – in the short term, but effectively destroy one of the most successful and productive environments for generating knowledge ever created. We are already seeing numerous tangible impacts, including:

-  [**Large numbers of layoffs of federal scientists**](https://www.science.org/content/article/wrecking-ball-rfk-jr-moves-fire-thousands-health-agency-employees);

**What is a grant? How are they selected?**

Today, a lot of scientific research and development within the US is funded through grants, which often come from government funding. The development of grant programs administered by government entities like the National Science Foundation (NSF) or the National Institute of Health (NIH) mostly occurred after World War II. For both [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/about/history#why-was-nsf-formed-bf0) and [NIH](https://history.nih.gov/display/history/WWII%20Research%20and%20the%20Grants%20Program), a large part of the motivation for developing grant programs was the recognition of the huge economic benefit provided by scientific research, something that became extremely clear during the WWII period where the government funded war effort also funded a lot of science, but also that relying on private foundations to fund scientific research was extremely limiting. It wasn’t just that these private foundations had limited money, but more importantly that it restricted “curiosity driven” science, as in science which was funded based on what particular philanthropists were interested in rather than what scientists were interested in or what might benefit society as a whole. There are different grants depending on the subject area, and they fund everything from pharmaceutical development to earthquake research. At present, other funding sources can include private organizations and companies, although the public sector now funds the vast majority of scientific research and development at universities in the US. Public and private funding are not fungible, either: [privately-funded research is more likely to be patented, with the patent held by a private company](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28160).   

The process for receiving this funding starts with a proposal to the funding institution, which is often a federal agency like the NSF or NIH. Within each agency, there are different “programs” that effectively represent different pots of money. Each program will have a theme and particular mission and scientists choose which program best fits the research they want to propose. Many of these themes are extremely broad, e.g., [the NSF program for studying the structure of the Earth](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/spse-structure-physics-solid-earth), giving scientists wide latitude to follow past innovations and their own interests in developing a proposal. That is to say, while the themes of the programs are defined by the agency, the actual research that is proposed and done, if the grant is awarded, is dictated by the scientists applying to the funding opportunities. Because funds are limited, these grants are highly competitive and developing the proposals – typically lengthy documents outlining the scientific rationale, prior work, and proposed new work, with numerous ancillary documents describing how data will be stored and distributed, graduate students will be mentored, and extremely detailed budgets with justifications for proposed expenses – is extremely time-consuming.  

One of the hallmarks of most federally funded proposals are that they are evaluated by other scientists in that field through a mixture of “ad-hoc reviews”, where the proposal is read by other scientists and critiqued, and during “review panels” where a group of scientists are assembled to go through the reviews, review the proposals themselves, and then rank them based on the novelty, feasibility, and importance of the proposed work. Those rankings are then used by program officers, who are employees of their respective agencies (e.g., NSF or NIH), but almost exclusively were also practicing scientists within their respective disciplines before taking positions as program officers, to choose which grants are funded. At all steps of the process, funding decisions are made exclusively by scientists, not politicians or bureaucrats. These scientists are independent, not affiliated with the funding agencies. 

---

**Why does it matter if active grants or proposal reviews are temporarily paused?**

There have been any number of [news articles](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/) about various pauses on either the review of new grant proposals or the active grants having funds frozen. Some of these are still in place, some of them are rescinded, and some of them appear to be approaching a form of Schrödinger's cat, both alive and dead depending on who is talking.  

It may be hard to understand why scientists are concerned about ""temporary"" pauses. One major reason – and why ""temporary"" is in scare quotes – is that in most of these cases, it's not actually clear how temporary these pauses really are. Beyond that, large portions of federally funded research are devoted to paying undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. These students and early career scientists are the backbone of modern science, not only doing a huge amount of the current work, but also are the future generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. For many of them, short delays in funding can be the [difference between them being able to stay in their chosen careers or having to leave](https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/trump-funding-freeze-national-science-foundation-suspends-salary-payments/).  Additionally, because each proposal represents huge time investments to prepare and the ""normal"" turnaround time between submission and decision is 6 months to a year, short-term delays compound an already slow process, leading to higher chances that students and other early career scientists who are living paycheck to paycheck will suddenly find themselves without any funding. Ultimately, short-term delays are bad enough, as they will disproportionately impact the next generation of scientists, but as we've seen, there are darker clouds on the horizon...

---

**Why are attacks on broadening participation in science damaging?**

Federal research grants often require specific sections of the proposal that discuss how other branches of science or society as a whole might benefit from the outcomes of the proposed work. For example, NSF proposals have a section called [Broader Impacts](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/learn/broader-impacts) that is required to be included by various US Congressional acts. At its core, broader impacts are meant to reflect how the project will benefit society as a whole, and these portions of funded projects often involve initiatives to promote human health and well-being, advances to key technologies or infrastructure, and a variety of efforts to improve STEM education and broaden participation in STEM fields, especially within groups which have been historically underrepresented or excluded from the disciplines. That means that while the executive order calling for a blanket halt on grant funding was rescinded, many grants remain in limbo while their broader impact sections are assessed to determine if they conflict with the still-standing executive order against federal support of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. 

While demographics vary between STEM disciplines, many fields have struggled to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, e.g., the [geosciences](https://www.americangeosciences.org/citations/closing-geoscience-talent-gap). At the same time, several are facing critical job gaps in the near future, as retirees in key fields are slated to outstrip new graduates available to replace them. Broadening participation in these disciplines meets a tangible societal need, and from a strictly pragmatic perspective, science as a whole benefits from the inclusion of people with diverse backgrounds, training, and experiences as shown in a variety of investigations across different fields (e.g., [this](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.3000421), or [this](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1700616114), or [this](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2200841119), or [this](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0278043) – and many more.

**What would proposed funding cuts do to science in the USA?**

This is really hard to answer. There is often a large difference between what US presidential administrations ask for in their budgets versus what Congress actually funds, and generally the US Congress has been unwilling to enact large cuts to major science funding agencies like the NSF and NIH. That being said, proposals like those from the Trump administration [asking for a &gt;60% cut to the NSF budget](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/white-house-budget-proposal-could-shatter-the-national-science-foundation/) would, without a doubt, cripple scientific research in the US if anything like this was adopted by Congress. Decades of cell lines would be lost, thousands of animals would be euthanized, and sensitive chemicals would be wasted, all in the name of ""saving money.""

It’s also critical to remember that a lot of both basic and applied science is not just done by federal grants to academics, but also by federally employed scientists working for agencies and organizations like the [NIH, CDC, NASA, USGS, FWS, USFS, NPS, EPA, NWS, NOAA, etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_research_and_development_agencies). The waves of [firings hitting these and other organizations](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/14/trump-musk-purge-thousands-federal-workers-fired/78606349007/) are going to further erode the scientific capacity of the US and have [large impacts beyond simply the advancement of science](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-team-looks-to-drastically-cut-noaa-staff-and-budget/)

---

**What are ""indirect costs"" and why does it matter if they're cut by a large amount?**

Most grant proposals contain requests for both ""direct"" and ""indirect"" costs in the budgets they submit to agencies. Direct costs are largely what they sound like: the direct costs of doing the proposed work, which might include salaries for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs working on the project, along with costs associated with analyses, field work, consumables (like chemicals), etc. That is, direct costs are typically costs that are tied *directly* to that proposed work and that proposed work only. On the other hand, indirect costs, sometimes called ""facilities and administration"" or just ""F&amp;A"", are the costs of essential services, resources, facilities and infrastructure, or staff support that is not tied to an individual proposal, but still need to be there for research to actually happen. There is a dizzying array of things covered at least in part by F&amp;A, including, but not limited to:

- **Paying utility bills:** It’s hard to do research if the lights are off, equipment has no power and there's no heating or cooling;

- **Hazardous chemical and biological waste management:** Someone has to deal with the messes that are created by running various experiments;

- **Libraries:** Journal subscriptions are expensive, but it's nearly impossible to stay current in your field and do good science without them;

- **Internet services:** It should go without saying that doing a lot of modern science would be impossible without consistent internet connection;

- **Administrative services:** Federally funded research is bound by an array of regulations. Scientists are not trained in navigating these regulations, and without administrative support, they would lose a large amount of time to work well outside their expertise, or lose their funding due to violation of these regulations; 

- **Facilities and equipment maintenance:** It’s hard to do good science if your fume hoods aren’t safe to use, your growth chambers don’t maintain the correct temperature and humidity, and all your machines are broken;

- **Animal facilities and care:** While some portions of this may be covered by direct costs, they are often covered by indirect costs, meaning that lab animals can be affected, or they can even be euthanized;

- **Updating general equipment like computers:** Generic, but essential, equipment that is used across many different projects are often hard to include in direct costs because they don’t meet the requirement that these direct costs should be for things for to be used for that the proposed project *only*, so the funding agency expects these to be paid for by the university, whose funds come from indirect costs; 

- **And many more**, depending on the needs of the individual research proposals.

The point is, things that are supported by indirect costs are *absolutely critical* activities and services that have to happen for science to be done, but they extend beyond individual research projects. It’s also important to understand what the numbers cited for indirect costs mean. A 50% indirect cost rate does not mean that half of the total grant award goes to indirect costs. In an example provided by MIT in 2017, a 54.7% indirect cost rate resulted in 28 cents of each award dollar going to overhead— 18 cents to facilities costs, 10 cents to administrative costs, 72 cents to direct research costs. The disconnect is because the ""indirect rate"" is only applied to some portions of the budget.

A common argument is that many things that are included in indirect costs could be viewed as direct costs, and while true to a certain extent, that ignores a variety of realities. The first is just that proposal budgets are already exceedingly complicated, and having to calculate things like what portion of the average monthly power bill for your lab space should be covered by a new proposal or *precisely* how many gallons of chemical waste you will generate over the course of a proposed project to be able to convert all the indirect costs to direct costs is a massive effort. Similarly, if you're wrong about any of those things, you actually end up generating a lot more waste than you thought you were going to, right now it doesn't matter because the indirect cost part of the proposal is effectively a fixed percentage tax that doesn't actually track how much you use those resources. If it was part of the direct costs, you'd have to rebudget your remaining funds every time some small detail changed. That is currently rolled into *all the things* covered by indirect costs. Switching all of those to direct costs would make the entire process much less efficient than it already is, and leading to more uncertainty in how much research can be done. 

The indirect cost rates vary between institutions. They are negotiated between institutions and the federal government based on the actual facilities and administrative costs for each institution in previous years, which are influenced by local cost of living as well as the types of facilities available at each institution. Indirect costs include facilities costs and administrative costs. There has been a maximum cap of 26% of F&amp;A that can go toward administrative costs since 1991; even as federal regulations have increased, the share of administrative costs in total indirect costs has remained flat, so the narrative that increases F&amp;A represents administrative bloat is largely overblown. Finally, in most cases, the indirect costs acquired through federal grants are insufficient to actually fully pay for all of the indirect costs incurred by universities as part of doing research. That is to say, federally funded scientific research generally does not fully pay for itself in terms of the resources it requires from the universities where this research is done. Suffice to say, sudden, dramatic, and draconian reductions in F&amp;A rates to [rates well below current negotiated rates](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/new-nih-policy-will-slash-support-money-to-research-universities/), if they come to fruition, will cause massive budget shortfalls at a large number research universities that are *already operating with a loss with respect to research activities*. That will generally mean that staff will be let go, programs will be shut down (i.e., individual majors or entire divisions will cease to exist), and the programs and faculty that remain will have significantly fewer resources to do the work they are trying to do, which is push scientific progress and educate the next generation of STEM professionals. Thus, reducing indirect costs unilaterally like what is proposed will lead to *less science being done, not more*. If you want to read more about what indirect costs are and what  activities on campuses they do (and don’t) support, this [FAQ from the American Association of Universities](https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/frequently-asked-questions-about-facilities-and-administrative-fa-costs-federally) is quite comprehensive.

**What can I do?**

If you're a US citizen, you can **contact your elected representatives** to tell them that you're worried about the funding of science and the loss of scientists in the federal workforce. [**You can find your elected members of Congress here.**](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member) 

If you're looking for more facts on how this will affect you, it's easy enough to find direct impacts by state or federal science funding. For example, [this page from the NSF](https://new.nsf.gov/about/fact-sheets#nsf-in-your-state-a2f) allows you to quickly see just how much of this money goes back into education and private industry in your given state from NSF funding. Similar resources exist for [NIH funding](https://report.nih.gov/) as well.

1mx7gl1,askscience,"If a human being consumed only the most purely necessary chemicals and nutrients to survive, what would their excrement look like?","I started wondering this because of what I’ve learned about urine. From what I’ve been told, urine is used to flush waste and harmful chemicals out of the body, which is why drinking lots of water will end up with more clear pee, because there’s less chemicals that need to be flushed out. That got me to thinking, well, what if a person drank only absolutely molecularly pure H2O, what would it look like then? Well, probably not fundamentally different, because there’s still other chemicals they consume or that the body creates that need to be flushed out. So, what if they only ate purely (on a chemical level) the basic fundamental nutrients needed to function?


This isn’t a question of quantity, but of quality. In this hypothetical, the person is not on starvation rations eating barely enough to cling to life, they’re eating enough to function healthily, but this person is just somehow chomping down on blocks of pure sodium and whatnot for lunch (disregarding however they would manage to do that). As the body constantly uses up different nutrients at different times, the person would be eating different amounts of whatever chemicals on different days based on what their body most and least needed at the time. 

Would they just barely ever need to use the restroom, and flush out close to nothing when they did? Or would their excrement still at least slightly comparable to that of a normal persons?

Earlier this week, we announced the first major results from scientists around the world who have been investigating tiny fragments of that sample.

[These grains of rock show that the building blocks of life and the conditions for making them existed on Bennu's parent body 4.5 billion years ago](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-asteroid-bennu-sample-reveals-mix-of-lifes-ingredients/). They contain amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - as well as all five of the nucleobases that encode genetic information in DNA and RNA.

The samples also contain minerals called evaporites, which exist on Earth, too. Evaporites are evidence that the larger body Bennu was once part of had a wet, salty environment. On Earth, scientists believe conditions like this played a role in life developing. The sample from asteroid Bennu provides a glimpse into the beginnings of our solar system.

Prion diseases are terrifying, the prions can trigger other proteins around it to misfold, and are absurdly hard to render inert even when exposed to prolonged high temperatures and powerful disinfectant agents. I also don’t know if they decay naturally in a decent span of time.

So… Why is it that they are so rare…? Nigh indestructible, highly infectious and can happen to any animal without necessarily needing to be transmitted from anywhere… Yet for the most part ecosystems around the world do not struggle with a pandemic of prions.

To me this implies there’s something inherent about natural environments that makes transmission unlikely, I don’t know if prion diseases are actually difficult to cross the species barrier, or maybe they do decay quite fast when the infected animal dies.",703,0.9,703,0,791.0,88.0,151,1743190431.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1jm3i95/how_does_nature_deal_with_prion_diseases/,False,True

Maybe this is a super basic question, but I genuinely have no idea.

I was opening a bottle of sparkling water and, as usual, gas started escaping and bubbles started rising to the top. You know, nothing weird. But then I realized I actually don’t understand what’s going on before that moment. Where is the gas coming from?

When the bottle is closed, the liquid doesn’t really have visible bubbles, so where is all that gas stored? Is it somehow trapped inside the water? That doesn’t make much sense to me. If you added up the volume of all those bubbles after opening it, it seems like it should take up a lot of space. So shouldn’t the liquid level be higher before opening it?

And then I started thinking about those machines that let you make sparkling water at home (like a SodaStream). How do they even manage to get gas the water? Is the gas somehow between the water molecules? Wouldn’t that take a lot of pressure?

As I read this my question I feel it sounds like I’m either a toddler or drunk. I swear I’m neither. I’m just a very confused economist trying to understand bubbles. Google didn’t help, so here I am asking you.

1m1c2mm,askscience,Are you actually conscious under anesthesia?,"General anesthesia is described as a paralytic and an amnesiac. So, you can't move, and you can't remember what happened afterwards.

Based on that description alone, however, it doesn't necessarily indicate that you are unaware of what is happening in the moment, and then simply can't remember it later.

In fact, I think there have been a few reported cases of people under general anesthesia that were aware of what was going on during surgery, but unable to move...and they remembered/reported this when they came out of anesthesia. 

So, in other words, they had the paralytic effect but not the amnesiac one.

My question, then, is: when you are under general anesthesia are you actually still awake and aware, but paralyzed, and then you simply don't remember any of it afterwards because of the amnesiac effect of the anesthesia?

On significantly rarer occasions, someone will walk by my apartment playing music from a speaker, and even though that's about the same volume, I can very clearly tell that it's quieter at the source but closer to me. The same effect happens when you're near a concert venue or club, and you can tell that music is being blasted from far away rather than played at a normal volume close to you, or when you hear a loud noise in the distance.

Why are we able to perceive distance and and source volume? In theory, since sound follows the inverse square law, it should be the same information reaching us at different volumes, and we'd need to either look for the source or move our heads around to narrow down the origin point of a sound, but I can hear a sound and pretty immediately know now just the direction it's coming from but the angle as well.

Glaciers are of course desolate areas inhospitable to plants, and most animals either depend on the sea in some way or are simply moving through to somewhere else.

In those interglacial periods there must've been huge areas of forest, grasslands and such that were rendered inhospitable by the advancing cold, and later totally destroyed by glaciers. So a continent-sized area was effectively sterilized outside of microorganisms, relative to its prior conditions.

So what happened to everything that lived there? It's obvious what happened to the individual plants and such; they just died. Animals probably went south with the climate, and plants gradually migrated south by propagating there, but south of that there were already existing animals and ecosystems that were themselves being displaced by the cold, up to a point closer to the equator.

I’ve noticed that COVID-19 has led to a wide range of persistent symptoms in many people, often called Long COVID: including things like fatigue, brain fog, dysautonomia, and more. Meanwhile, other respiratory illnesses like the seasonal flu don’t seem to cause such widespread or long-lasting effects in most cases.

What is it about SARS-CoV-2 or the body’s response to it that leads to these prolonged symptoms? Is it related to the virus itself, the immune response, or something else? And why don’t we see similar post-viral syndromes as commonly with other viruses?

Your thymus gland produces most of your T-cells before birth. The rest are made in childhood and you’ll have all the T-cells you need for life by the time you hit puberty.”

I also understand that the instance of the non-disjunction events occurs more frequently the older the mother is simply due to the eggs getting older and more mistakes are likely to be made during meiosis.

What I don’t understand is how is this possible if the statement ‘a baby girl is born with all of the eggs she will ever make’ is true? I understood that as meiosis occurring in the ovaries of the foetus, so the ovaries of a newborn baby girl are already formed and full of eggs at birth.

So how, then, does non-disjunction occur during meiosis in older eggs if meiosis has already occurred at the foetal stage?

1m6pyr5,askscience,Is there a function that flips powers?,"The short question is the following:
Is there a function f(n) such that f(p^q) = q^p for all primes p and q. 

My guess is that such a function does not exist but I can't see why. The way that I stumbled upon this question was by looking at certain arithmetic functions and seeing what flipping the input would do. So for example for subtraction, suppose a-b = c, what does b-a equal in terms of c? Of course the answer is -c. I did the same for division and then I went on to exponentiation but couldn't find an answer.

After thinking about it, I realised that the only input for the function that makes sense is a prime number raised to another prime because otherwise you would be able to get multiple outputs for the same input. But besides this idea I haven't gotten very far. 

My suspicion is that such a funtion is impossible but I don't know how to prove it. Still, proving such an impossibility would be a suprising result as there it seems so extremely simple. How is it possible that we can't make a function that turns 9 into 8 and 32 into 25.

I would love if some mathematician can prove me either right or wrong. 

Edit: To clarify, when I say ""does a function exist such that... "" I mean can you make such a function out of normal operations (+, -, ÷, ×, ^, log(, etc.). Defining the function to be that way is not a really a valid solution in that sense.

Edit 2: On another sub someone answered my question:
""[Here is an example of an implementation of your function in desmos using only common functions.](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7wiy7j0ja1) Note that it is VERY computationally expensive and not viable for very large numbers.""

1. Skyscrapers are built to sway a bit in the wind to preserve structural integrity. This made me wonder if even smaller structures, like a house or a shed, move (or are deformed) by wind, even if it would extremely hard to measure that movement or deformation. 

2. The above thought made me remember a old conversation I had with my high school physics teacher. The problem was related to measuring the angle of deformation if a weight were hung on a  metal rod. It seems to me that a small enough weight (say an empty hanger) on a metal closet rod, would not result in any deformation. But whatever formula we were using would result in some small angle for even the slightest weight.  

It seems intuitive that there is some weight an object can take without any deformation or movement before it starts to move or deform. Is this correct, or is there anyways some slight deformation / movement when a force is applied?",396,0.9,396,0,446.0,49.0,84,1760020184.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1o27g5c/does_an_applied_force_always_deform_or_move_an/,False,True

1ikt0o0,askscience,"If you had both a viral and bacterial infection, how would the immune system react?","Hello! I'm not quite sure how to phrase this question. 

I was wondering if you had a bacterial infection that the immune system was responding to, while then contracting a viral infection, how would the immune system react? For example, let's say I have strep throat and then I contracted COVID 19 at the same time. If my immune system was already recruiting cells to fight the strep throat, would that make it easier to fight a subsequent infection (like the COVID in this example)?

I only have some rudimentary knowledge on the immune system. I know there are cells that deal with viruses and different ones that deal with bacteria. But if the bacterial and viral infection is in the same place (i.e. respiratory tract) would the inflammation help the immune system recruit cells for both?

What about having infections in two different places? Like bacterial vaginosis and COVID? Would one of the infections triggering a fever help fight the other infection?

I'm not sure if I'm making sense, but if someone understands what I'm asking, let me know if you have some info! Thank you!

1kandgx,AskHistorians,Joint Subreddit Statement: The Attack on U.S. Research Infrastructure,"Many of you are likely familiar with the news of the Trump Administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminating grants and budgets at the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-under-orders-cancel-2-6-billion-contracts) (NIH), the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/science/trump-national-science-foundation-grants.html) (NSF), the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.wired.com/story/institute-museum-library-services-layoffs/) (IMLS), and the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/03/nx-s1-5350994/neh-grants-cut-humanities-doge-trump) (NEH), as well as posturing around the [Smithsonian Institution](https://fortune.com/2025/03/28/trump-smithsonian-museum-vance-doge-budget-cuts-science-arts-culture-diversity-dei/) and the [National Gallery of Art](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/washington-dc-national-gallery-of-art-gets-a-visit-from-doge).  There is no way to sugarcoat it.  These actions endanger the intellectual freedom of every individual in the United States, and even impact the health and safety of people across the world by willfully tearing down the nation’s research infrastructure.  As moderators of academic subreddits, we engage with public audiences, every one of you, on a daily basis, and while you may not see the direct benefits of these institutions, you all experience the benefits of a federally supported research environment.  We feel it is our responsibility to share with you our thoughts and seek your help before the catastrophic consequences of these reckless actions.

Granting of research awards is  a dull bureaucracy behind exciting projects.  Each agency functions differently, but across agencies, research grants are a highly competitive process.  Teams of researchers led by a Primary Investigator (or PI) write an application to a specific grant program for funding to support a relevant project.  Most granting agencies,  require a narrative about the project’s purpose, rationale, and impacts, descriptions of anticipated outputs (like a website, a public dataset, software, conference presentations, etc), detailed budgets on how funding would be spent, work plans, and, if accepted, regular updates until project completion.   Funding pays for things like staff, equipment, travel,  promotional materials, and most importantly, the next generation of scholars through research assistantships.  PIs rarely see the total sum themselves, rather universities receive the grant on behalf of a project team and distribute the funds.  Grants include “overhead” meaning a university receives a sizable portion of the funds to pay for building space, facilities, janitorial staff, electricity, air conditioning, etc. Overhead helps support the broader community by providing funds for non-academic employees and contracts with local businesses.

Grants from NIH, NSF, IMLS, and NEH make up a very small portion of the federal budget.  In 2024, the NIH received [$48.811 billion](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R43341#:~:text=In%20FY2024%2C%20NIH%20received%20a,increase%20(less%20than%201%25).), the NSF [$9.06 billion](https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2024/appropriations), IMLS received [$294.8 million](https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/what-happens-to-libraries-if-imls-goes-away) and the NEH was given [$207 million](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48255#:~:text=National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Humanities,-NEH%20supports%20grants&amp;text=The%20Federal/State%20Partnership%20program,in%20the%20FY2023%20appropriations%20act.&amp;text=individuals%20with%20the%20exception%20of,or%20American%20Jazz%20Masters%20Fellowships.&amp;text=Statement%20Regarding%20Consolidated-,Appropriations%20Act%2C%202024%2C%20Congressional%20Record%2C%20vol.,S1175%2C%20S1858.&amp;text=Statement%20Regarding%20Consolidated-,Appropriations%20Act%2C%202024%2C%20Congressional%20Record%2C%20vol.,S1175%2C%20S1858.).  These numbers sound gigantic, and this $58.37 billion total sounds even more massive, but it’s less than 1% of the [$6.8 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61181) federal budget.  These are literal pennies for the sake of supposed efficiency. 

For Redditors, one immediate impact is [NSF defunding of research grants related to misinformation and disinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/science/trump-national-science-foundation-grants.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CE8.j1wq.BnsNtONSjcFk&amp;smid=url-share).  As moderators of academic communities, fighting mis/disinformation is a crucial part of our work; from vaccine conspiracies to Holocaust denial, the internet is rife with dangerous content.  We moderate harmful content to allow our subscribers to read informed dialogue on topics, but research on how to combat misinformation is “[not in alignment with current NSF priorities](https://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities)” under this administration.

For the humanities, the NEH terminated grants to reallocate funds [“in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”](https://newrepublic.com/article/193628/trump-grantee-termination-letters-education)  Every presidential administration will shift research interests, but these new guidelines are not in the interest of academic research, rather they seek to curate a specific vision and chill research ideas that disagree with a political agenda.  Under the executive order to restore [“Truth and Sanity to American History,”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/) honest inquiry is subservient to nationalistic ideology, a move that [r/AskHistorians strongly opposes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jmmj3w/megathread_truth_sanity_and_history/).

Other agencies that provide key sources of information to academics and the public alike face layoffs including the [National Archives](https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-archives-firings-layoffs-historical-recordkeeping-559027fdd2f634263bea7774a78d66fe) and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://apnews.com/article/noaa-job-cuts-weather-forecasts-trump-doge-musk-7e35e9d5d757d8fc3f0f50b2bd71c87d).

[The NIH is seeking to pull funding from universities based on politics](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/21/us/nih-bans-grants-universities-dei-programs/index.html), not scientific rigor.  Many of these cuts come from the administration’s opposition to DEI or diversity, equity, and inclusion, and [it will kill people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/hiv-research-funding-cut/index.html).  Decisions to terminate research funding for HIV or studies focused on minority populations will harm other scientific breakthroughs, and research may answer questions unbeknownst to scientists.  Research opens doors to intellectual progress, often by sparking questions not yet asked.  [To ban research on a bad faith framing of DEI](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5289912/unprecedented-white-house-moves-to-control-science-funding-worry-researchers) is to assert one’s politics above academic freedom and tarnish the prospects of discovery.  Even where funding is not cut, [the sloppy review of research funding](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/31/nx-s1-5282162/scientists-grants-frozen-trump-executive-actions-dei-deia) halts progress and interrupts projects in damaging ways.

Beyond cuts to funding, the Trump administration is attacking the scholars and scientists who do the work.  At Harvard Medical School, [Kseniia Petrova’s work may aid cancer diagnostics but she has been held in an immigration detention center for two months](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-detain-kseniia-petrova-protest-harvard-cancer-research-rcna202180).  [The American Historical Association just released a statement condemning the targeting of foreign scholars](https://www.historians.org/news/american-historical-association-condemns-targeting-of-foreign-scholars/).  This is not solely an issue of federal funding, but an issue of inhumanity by the Trump Administration’s Department of Homeland Security.

The unfortunate political reality is that there is little we can do to stop the train now that it’s left the station.  [You can, and should, call your member of Congress](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member), but this is not enough.  **We need you to help us change minds.**  There are likely family members and loved ones in your life who support this effort.  Talk to them.  Explain how federal funds result in [medical breakthroughs](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/malaria-vaccines-provide-strong-lasting-immunity), how [library and museum grants](https://www.ala.org/news/2025/04/imls-cuts-put-americas-public-libraries-risk) support your community, and how [humanities research](https://nhalliance.org/nha-statement-neh-doge-threats/) connects us to our shared cultural heritage.  Is there an elder in your life who cares about [testing for Alzheimer’s disease?](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/accurate-blood-test-alzheimer-s-disease) A mother, sister, or daughter who cares about [the Women’s Health Initiative](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/womens-health-initiative-whi)?  A parent who wants their child to [read at grade level](https://www.imls.gov/our-work/partnerships/campaign-grade-level-reading)?

We will not escape this moment ourselves.  As academics and moderators, we are not enough to protect our disciplines from these attacks.  We need you too.  [Write letters, sign petitions, and make phone calls](https://www.aclu.org/writing-your-elected-representatives), but more importantly talk with others.  Engage with us here on Reddit, share with your friends offline, and help us get the word out that our research infrastructure matters.  So many of us are privileged to work in academic research and adjacent areas because of public support, and we are so grateful to live out our enthusiasms, our zeal, our obsessions, and our love for the arts, humanities, and sciences, and in doing so, contributing to the public good.  Thank you for all the support you’ve given us over the years- to see millions of you appreciate the subjects that we’ve dedicated our lives to brings us so much joy that it feels wrong to ask for more, but the time has never been more consequential- please help us.  Go change one mind, gain us one more advocate and together we can protect the U.S. research infrastructure from further damage.

We ask that experts in our respective communities also share examples in the comments of the dangers and effects of these political actions.  Lists of terminated grants are available here: [NIH](https://fedinvent.substack.com/p/hhs-published-a-list-of-canceled), [NSF](https://airtable.com/appGKlSVeXniQZkFC/shrFxbl1YTqb3AyOO?jntvk%3Aview=plaeS6fTnZvbmtQRS&amp;jntvk%3Asort=eyJwZWw4ZlRSME8ycmFObWNUYyI6eyJjb2x1bW5JZCI6ImZsZDM1bDhTVUJTeUhtbktNIiwiYXNjZW5kaW5nIjp0cnVlfX0), [IMLS](https://www.cosla.org/imls-grant-cancellations), and [NEH](https://impact.ach.org/).

“Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves.

Miep told us about someone who’d managed to escape from there. It must be terrible in Westerbork. The people get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink, as water is available only one hour a day, and there’s only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women sleep in the same room, and women and children often have their heads shaved. Escape is almost impossible; many people look Jewish, and they’re branded by their shorn heads. If it’s that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and uncivilized places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of them are being murdered. The English radio says they’re being gassed. Perhaps that’s the quickest way to die. I feel terrible.

1nj1qbl,AskHistorians,What happened to the “leave in for 2 minutes” instructions on conditioner bottles?,"I grew up in the 1980s, when shampoo and conditioner bottles nearly always had instructions like *“Leave on hair for 2 minutes before rinsing.”* And I, being a prolific reader of bathroom products (a captive audience if ever there was one), took this very seriously.

Then, sometime around the late 1990s or early 2000s, it seemed like every brand — across the board — quietly dropped those wait times. Suddenly the bottles just said “apply and rinse” or maybe “leave on as desired.” And I remember being baffled:

* Did the chemistry of conditioner suddenly leap forward so much that my hair no longer needed two full minutes of marination?
* Was the “2 minutes” rule just made up in the first place?
* Did the industry realize it was bad marketing to remind consumers how long they were standing around, dripping wet, counting Mississippis in the shower?
* Or (my personal suspicion at the time) was this a sneaky ploy to make me use twice as much conditioner in half the time, so I’d run out faster?

Because the shift happened so widely and almost simultaneously, it feels like there must have been some kind of industry-level change — whether in cosmetic chemistry, FDA labeling guidance, or just a new marketing philosophy.

So my question is: **Why did those “leave in for 2 minutes” instructions vanish from shampoo and conditioner bottles around 2000? Was it a matter of science, regulation, or business practice?**

Carr wrote in *What is History?*, “we can view the past, and achieve our understanding of the past, only through the eyes of the present.” Historians work in the contemporary, and ask questions accordingly.  It's why we see scholarship on U.S. History incorporate more race history in the wake of the Civil Rights movement and why post-9/11 U.S. historians began writing significantly on questions of American empire.  In our global context now, you see historians focusing on transnational histories and expect a lot of work on histories of medicine and disease in our post-pandemic world.  The present inspires new perspectives and we update our understanding of history from knowledge gleaned from new interpretations.  We read and discern from primary sources that existed for centuries but approach them with our own experiences to bridge the past and present.    
  
The Trump Administration is taking the truth- that history is complicated and informed by the present- to distort the credibility of historians, museums, and scholars by proclaiming this is an ideological act rather than an intellectual one.  Scholarship is a dialogue: we give you footnotes and citations to our sources, explain our thinking, and ask new questions.  This dialogue evolves like any other conversation, and the notion that this is revisionist or bad is an admission that you aren’t familiar with how scholarship functions.  We are not simply sitting around saying “George Washington was president” but rather seeking to understand Washington as a complex figure.  New information, new perspectives, and new ideas means that we revise our understanding.  It does not necessarily mean a past scholar was wrong, but acknowledges that the story is complicated and endeavors to find new meaning in the intricacies for our modern times.    
  
We cannot tell the history of the United States by its great moments alone: World War II was a triumphant achievement, but what does that achievement mean when racism remained pervasive on the home front?  The American Revolution set forth a nation in the tradition of democracy, but how many Indigenous people were displaced by it?  When could all women vote in that democracy?  History is not a series of happy moments but a sequence of sophisticated ideas that we all must grapple with to understand our place in the next chapter.  There is no truth and no sanity in telling half the story.

The moderator team invites users to share examples from their area of expertise about doing history at the intersection of politics and share instances of how historical revisionism benefits scholarship of the past.  Some of these posts may be of interest:

1n91pjg,AskHistorians,"I'm Dr. Elizabeth Reis and the US Naval Academy banned my book, Bodies in Doubt: An American History of Intersex, from their library last spring. Ask Me Anything!","When I first published [*Bodies in Doubt: An American History of Intersex*](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/bodies-doubt) in 2009, not many people had even heard of “intersex,” though of course individuals have always been born with innate variations of sex characteristics such as genitals, chromosomes, hormones, and gonads. Johns Hopkins University Press asked me to write a new edition (2021) because more than a decade later, much has changed. Intersex is [now in the public eye](https://msmagazine.com/2018/10/26/intersex-people-wontbeerased-either/), in large part due to the efforts of determined advocates who have been working since the 1990s to change the medical standard of care for intersex children.

*Bodies in Doubt* is a history of the medical management of intersex from early America to the present. I analyzed historical medical journals and doctors’ case reports of those born with anatomical characteristics that often made their sex difficult to determine. Many of these people lived much of their lives without needing medical attention; when they did see a doctor (often for something unrelated to intersex), physicians wanted to make sure that a person’s professed gender identity aligned with heterosexual desire. In other words, doctors worried that someone who wasn’t sure of their own sex would partner with the “wrong” sex. Adults were difficult for physicians to deal with because they had already formed their gender identity. So, in the 1950s, when John Hopkins University Hospital psychologist John Money and his colleagues suggested “fixing” children’s bodies in order to avoid later problems, his ideas took off. 

We know from countless intersex people today that surgically and hormonally altering children when they are too young to provide consent is not a good idea; there are lasting psychological as well physical consequences (scarring, incontinence, sterility, and enforcing the wrong gender, for example), and [today’s advocates](https://interactadvocates.org/) are working to stop nonconsensual intersex surgeries on infants and children.

I’m looking forward to answering questions about intersex management, then and now. Intersex and transgender issues are related, but not the same. Today’s anti-transgender bans often include an exception for intersex medical intervention. In other words, they ban gender affirming care for transgender teenagers but say that it’s OK for intersex kids to receive hormones and surgery, often when they are still babies or toddlers. This undermines the years of advocacy work trying to convince physicians and parents that letting kids decide for themselves how their bodies look and function is the best way forward. 

EDIT: Thanks everyone! This was my first time on Reddit, and so I didn't know what to expect. I really enjoyed answering all your questions! I'll continue to answer the ones I didn't get to today, so please check back.

1hris1s,AskHistorians,"In letters and speeches, 19th century author Charles Dickens repeatedly called for the physical “extermination” of subcontinental Indians and applauded the “mutilation of the wretched Hindoo.” Was this kind of extreme racism considered acceptable by the standards of Victorian society? ","To use just one example: 

In an 1857 letter to Madame de la Rue, Charles Dickens wrote:

&gt;You know faces, when they are not brown; you know common experiences when they are not under turbans; Look at the dogs – low, treacherous, murderous, tigerous villians.

&gt;I wish I were Commander in Chief over there \[India\]! I would address that Oriental character which must be powerfully spoken to, in something like the following placard, which should be vigorously translated into all native dialects, “I, The Inimitable, holding this office of mine, and firmly believing that I hold it by the permission of Heaven and not by the appointment of Satan, have the honor to inform you Hindoo gentry that it is my intention, with all possible avoidance of unnecessary cruelty and with all merciful swiftness of execution, to exterminate the Race from the face of the earth, which disfigured the earth with the late abominable atrocities.”

Why did Charles Dickens target Indians specifically? He nowhere expresses the same level of hatred for other races.  How did Dickens reconcile his racist anti-Indian beliefs with his support for humanitarian causes? How has the image of Charles Dickens as the epitome of all that was good in the nineteenth century managed to persist despite these inflammatory racist comments?",2638,0.96,2638,0,2753.0,115.0,113,1735783169.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hris1s/in_letters_and_speeches_19th_century_author/,False,True
1heqhmd,AskHistorians,"Whenever the question is asked here, the answers are often that medieval/early modern Western society wasn't nearly as conservative as people think (prostitution was rampant to an extent we'd find bizarre even today.) Do our modern perceptions of ""traditionalism"" solely come from about 1800-1955?","Even when there were laws against stuff it seems like there were a LOT of people slipping through the cracks

In addition to the prostitution stuff (which even Catholic thought leaders like Thomas Aquinas conceded was so widespread that it wouldn't be worth banning) there was also a Renaissance painter nicknamed [""Il Sodoma"" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Sodoma)and somehow despite related laws technically having a maximum penalty of death he apparently signed his work as that and gladly embraced the nickname

And needless to say you wouldn't see anything akin to that in ultraconservative modern day states like Saudi Arabia or Iran (even if it was a joke why would you joke about something that could get you in massive trouble) plus this guy even corresponded and met with the Pope so he was hardly laying low from the public eye of morality

Italy in particular seems to be the center of medieval debauchery in this era especially Florence whenever I look at stories on the topic

So would a relatively recent Western cultural era ACTUALLY be the most ""sex-negative"" in recent history? There's far more detailed historical recordings of the 1950s and you don't hear about this type of stuff out in the open.

The massive success of Pokémon as a franchise quickly rocketed Pikachu to stardom, with the electric mouse serving as mascot ever since. The original two games even got a remake as *Pokémon Yellow*, which was designed to resemble the anime, giving the player a buffed starter Pikachu who follows you on-screen.

It's fair to say that Pikachu has been nothing short of a marketing gold mine for Nintendo/GameFreak/Creatures Inc.

I’m going to ask for a higher interest rate to be persuaded to hold this,’ then we could have a real accident on our hands.” He goes on to say that there may be measures beyond austerity (i.e. beyond what we saw in Greece in the 2010s), with potentially huge geopolitical and economic implications.

Some context:

* During WWII, the house was **occupied by Nazis** before my family lived there.
* The document is typed on **very thin “pelure” paper** with a typewriter, and uses **I for 1 and O for 0** (common for machines of the 1930s-1950s).
* It contains **people’s names** (e.g. Suzanne \[something\], Achille Chiche, Pierre Rost…), followed by several **5-6 digit numbers**, sometimes **consecutive** (e.g. 147653 / 147655 / 147654).
* At the bottom, there’s something like **“FURAN 4964”** — which might refer to an old telephone exchange (“Furan” is also the name of a river in Saint-Étienne, France).
* My grandfather showed it to the army years ago; they said something about “code names,” but they weren’t sure either.

We’ve been trying to figure this out for **decades** with no luck.

**Questions:**

* Could these be **ration ticket serial numbers** assigned to people during or after WWII?
* Or some sort of **resistance network codes**, aliases, or safehouse lists?
* Could “FURAN 4964” confirm a **telephone number** or a **location**?
* Has anyone seen a similar **format of typewritten sheets** from the 1940s-1950s in France?

The project involved building a massive salvage ship, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, which lowered a huge claw to the sea bed and lifted the sub to the surface. While the mission was not a complete success, with a large portion of the submarine breaking away and falling during the lift, about a third of the submarine was retrieved.

We still don't know everything the Americans found in the wreckage, but we do know that the remains of six Soviet sailors were found.

1of672r,AskHistorians,I just watched a terrific German movie from 1946 that ended up feeling inappropriate. Can someone add some historical context to this unusual film?,"The title of the movie is *Die Mörder sind unter uns*. It's a powerful story of a concentration camp survivor who returns to her ravaged Berlin home to find a strange man living there. The man ends up lingering on and a romance blossoms. The man is a former soldier in the German Army and we follow him as he comes into contact with his former captain in the Army, a man who is evidently responsible for terrible crimes during the War.

It's incredibly well composed and written. It contains marvelous shots of post-War Berlin.

Anyway, the crazy thing about the movie, the first German film made since the end of the War, is that not a single mention is made of Jews. The female lead survived a concentration camp, but no reference is made to why she was put there. At some point, one character mentions that it was due to something that her father did. Which sort of implies that her internment wasn't due to any Jewish heritage of hers.

That's the one crazy, unexpected element.

Then towards the very end, we find out what it is that the captain character exactly is guilty of. Let's just say that he victimized civilians during the War. Again, no reference to Jews, at all. Then, the very last shots come and we get to see a view of a vast cemetery, signifying the innocents lost during the War. The shot of the cemetery is one of a cross-studded field..

Hmm. Am I being silly when I feel like the movie almost whitewashes that history?

It gets even worse, and here's a SPOILER coming, because in the end, the captain war criminal's life is saved and the filmmakers argue that it isn't for us, the common man, to pass judgement on war criminals.

I can't imagine the risk of infection and complications wasn't extremely high, especially in cases where not only the testicles but also the penis were removed. The procedure alone being often done without anaesthetics would have killed some people, as extreme pain can lead to shock and cardiac arrest, no?

There is a video on YouTube about ""brothel boys"" during the Qing Dynasty that depicts the young victims being buried up to the head in sand after the castration for 3 days.

The video itself is not of very high educational quality and rather disturbing in the casual way it's presented and lacks citations and in-depth explanations, but since I unfortunately watched it, I'm left with quite a few questions around that.

[Kore from Chios](https://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/en/statue-kore-kore-chios). Am I supposed to believe that the sculptors carved single strands of hair and folds in the clothes and then decided to paint it all over with no shading at all, loosing a lot of detail instead of adding any?

1ihxq48,AskHistorians,"In medieval Islam, anyone could criticize Islamic teachings and draw images of the prophet Mohammed without risk of prosecution for blasphemy. So what explains why blasphemy in Islam is such a big deal in modern times, often resulting in severe persecution and capital punishment for offenders?","The legal historian Sadakat Kadri writes:

&gt;And though **actual prosecutions for blasphemy are extremely infrequent in the historical record** — with one of the few known cases ending in an acquittal — Islam's penal resurrectionists have been increasingly likely in recent decades to call for its punishment. Many of their arguments have a familiar ring. Criminalising hostility towards Islam is said to safeguard communal cohesion. It supposedly protects the faith against external subversives, just as apostasy defends against enemies within. It is, in other words, another branch of religious high treason.

— Heaven on earth (2012)    

Moreover, the prophet Mohammed has been depicted extensively in the Indian, Persian and Ottoman Muslim artistic tradition. For example, here is an [illustration of the prophet Mohammed with the angel Gabriel in a medieval Iranian manuscript published in 1307 CE.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mohammed_receiving_revelation_from_the_angel_Gabriel.jpg) None of these artists ever risked death for blasphemy.

From this perspective, the 1989 fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Salman Rushdie for blasphemy seems unprecedented. What happened in 20th century Islam that made it acceptable for conservative and fundamentalist Muslims to kill people for what they consider blasphemy i.e. criticizing Islamic teachings or drawing pictures of the prophet Mohammed?

AMA!","Hi folks! I’m John Kinder, a historian of war and society at Oklahoma State University. I write about all sorts of things, but lately, I’ve been interested in one question above all others:

**What happens to zoos when nations go to war?**

That’s the topic of my recent book, [World War Zoos: Humans *and Other Animals in the Deadliest Conflict of the Modern Age*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo245346797.html), which was published by the University of Chicago Press in April 2025. 

Here’s a blurb from the press:

""**A new and heartbreaking history of World War II as told through the shocking experiences** **of zoos across the globe.** As Europe lurched into war in 1939, zookeepers started killing their animals. On September 1, as German forces invaded Poland, Warsaw began with its reptiles. Two days later, workers at the London Zoo launched a similar spree, dispatching six alligators, seven iguanas, sixteen southern anacondas, six Indian fruit bats, a fishing cat, a binturong, a Siberian tiger, five magpies, an Alexandrine parakeet, two bullfrogs, three lion cubs, a cheetah, four wolves, and a manatee over the next few months. Zoos worldwide did the same. The reasons were many, but the pattern was clear: The war that was about to kill so many people started by killing so many animals. Why? And how did zoos, nevertheless, not just survive the war but play a key role in how people did, too?""

I’m here to answer your questions about what happened to zoos--in the US, Europe, Asia, and elsewhere--during World War II. I can also *try* to answer some of your questions about zoos in contemporary conflicts.

As some of you might know, my other research focus is the history of disabled veterans in the United States. I’m the author of [Paying with Their Bodies: *American War and the Problem of the Disabled Veteran*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo19289631.html) and co-editor, with Jason Higgins, of [Service Denied: *Marginalized Veterans in Modern American History*](https://www.umasspress.com/9781625346537/service-denied/), so if you’ve any questions about disabled vets, I’m happy to take a crack at them as well!

Ask me anything...and I’ll do my best.

  
Note: I'll check in around 11:00 pm CST and then throughout the day until I get exhausted or the questions dry up. ",1472,0.97,1472,0,1519.0,47.0,151,1750685854.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ligsyk/my_name_is_john_kinder_im_here_to_talk_about_my/,False,True

1lbs9nt,AskHistorians,What was the laughter about when hitler read names of certain countries from FDR's letter?,"There's a video of Hitler from 1939 giving a speech and a there’s a moment where he reads excerpts from Roosevelt’s letter, demanding that german troops do not attack following independent nations, lithuania, estonia, latvia, norway, sweden, denmark, switzerland, , netherland, belgium, great britain, ireland, france, portugal, spain, lichtenstien, luxembourg, poland, hungary, romania, yugoslavia, rusia, bulgaria, turkey, iraq, arabia, syria, palestine, egypt.

The audience laughs out loud when he mentions certain countries, it starts at mention of Ireland and picks up at France, slowly continues and peaks against at mention of Poland then quiets down as hitler continues and then explosive laughter from the attendees as he mentions Syria, Palestine and Egypt at the end of the list that contained some 30 names.

What exactly was the laughter outburst about?

1nebxvr,AskHistorians,"How do I efficiently debunk the claim that ""Sexual Liberation"" is the Death Knell of Civilizations?","Recently, u/Remarkable_Run_5801 proposed a historical theory that sounded absolutely insane to me, but I'm not a historian and I feel like the way I'd approach responding to it isn't the right way to go about it. Here's their claim:

&gt;There's a canary which indicates the inflection point at which a civilization begins its rapid fall:

&gt;So-called ""sexual liberation.""

&gt;It's the death knell of society beyond which no empire or civilization has ever sustained itself.  We're deep in it.

&gt;Promiscuity, in particular, is like dumping out your used motor oil in your yard. If a few people are doing it, there's basically zero effect. If lots of people are doing it, everything goes to hell.

&gt;Civilizations rise by channeling reproductive energy into stable family units, which serve as the foundation of economic productivity, cultural continuity, and intergenerational investment. “Sexual liberation” we'll take as t**he removal of constraints on promiscuity, divorce, and non-reproductive sexuality.**

&gt;It systematically undermines this foundation. Fertility rates collapse as individual gratification overrides the collective imperative to reproduce.

&gt;Investment in long-term provision declines when paternity certainty erodes, while female investment in childrearing declines as opportunity costs rise. The result is **atomization**: **fewer children, weaker kinship networks, and higher dependency ratios.**

&gt;Historical cases, from **late Rome to post-Weimar Germany,** show the same pattern: **sexual norms loosen, birth rates plunge, and the state compensates by expanding coercive control, ultimately collapsing under demographic and social strain. Thus, sexual liberation is not “freedom” but demographic suicide.**

Isn't part of the core problem with this theory that in order for it to make sense we have to apply a moving goalpost for what ""sexual liberation"" even means? Or maybe what they're referring to is correlation not causation, because whatever a given era would describe as sexual freedom would happen to rise after that civilization has reached a level of prosperity that's also associated with decline for unrelated reasons?

1m1f005,AskHistorians,"Why did the US attack Iraq, instead of going after Saudi Arabia after 9 11 attack?","15 of the 19 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia. I might be stupid for thinking like this, but there has to be some very active group operating in their country that was radicalising so many young men—there's no way their government or the US wasn't aware of that.

We all know Wahhabism — ultra-conservative, radical, and hardline — originated in Saudi Arabia and was state-sponsored for decades. In fact, during the 1970s and the following decades, Saudi Arabia and a few other Arab countries funded numerous Wahhabi madrasas globally, spreading radical extremist ideas among the youth in both the Arabian Peninsula and South and Southeast Asia. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has certainly begun to distance itself from this legacy.


So back to my point, ​If the US's goal was really to fight terrorism, then why go after Iraq or Afghanistan instead of cracking down on those actually funding radical organisations? In fact, Saudi Arabia has always been a long-time ally of the US—so why did the US let the radicals rise? And why did they attack Iraq? Because it's safe to say it was not to fight terrorism, and we all know the claim about Iraq possessing chemical weapons was a cover-up.

What was their beef with Saddam Hussein? During the Iran-Iraq war, America backed Saddam Hussein. In fact, America even shot down an Iranian aircraft carrying more than 200 Iranian civilians during the Iran-Iraq war, which finally put a halt to the conflict. I used to believe our governments actually wanted to combat terrorism, but now I feel like a big fool.

For the longest time, I wasn’t sure who to side with—Israel or Gaza. But now that I think of it, if Netanyahu truly wants to fight terrorism, then why not go after their real bosses sitting in Qatar? Qatar is an ally of the US, so it shouldn’t be hard for them to turn off the funding flowing into Gaza.

(​Yeah Ik in the end it's all about money and influence. With Saudis they buy a lot of oil and sell weapons worth tens of ​billions of dollars. ALso ur enemy's enemy is ur friend, so both have the common enemy Iran)

Edit:To the few people defending Saudi Arabia and saying it doesn't matter where those guys were from — I personally think it matters a lot. In fact, it explains a lot about the chaos in the Middle East. There was growing discontent among the youth about U.S. interference in their region. Add rising radicalism to that, and you get a fatal combination.

And Bin Laden was not ousted because of his radical ideologies. In fact, from 1979 to 1989, during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, he was a U.S. ally. It was only during the Gulf War, when U.S. troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia, that Bin Laden publicly opposed the Saudi government for allowing them in. ​So now we have a country breeding radical extremists, many of whom were livid about the U.S. — so it’s no coincidence, and it certainly explains why most of those guys on 9/11 were Saudis.",1278,0.88,1278,0,1480.0,202.0,189,1752678321.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1m1f005/why_did_the_us_attack_iraq_instead_of_going_after/,False,True

1olmklw,AskHistorians,"Why does it seem like people became ""kinder"" starting around the 1700s?","Edit: Seems like this question has attracted people who are enamored with the narrative that ""Europeans improved everything and colonialism was good actually"" which seems obviously false because many of these movements were actually against everything that created colonialism: Monarchies, slavery, racism... that sort of things

If anything, maybe the fact that colonialism increased all of these evils, while at the same time making the world more interconnected, helped raise a sort of awareness that this was all wrong... But that's just one hypothesis

I considered taking this question down, but I figure someone else could post another version of it, so I'll leave it here

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The world used to be a really cruel place. Slavery was common, different forms of mutilation were common punishments, and sometimes people would be mutilated for social reasons, like women with bound feet, or eunuchs. Executions were common, and public! Armies would not only take cities for massacre them, and killing tens of thousands of war prisoners wasn't unheard of 

I could keep going, but you get the point. We have a lot of problems today, but I get the impression the world just isn't as cruel as it used to be. Even the worse atrocities of recent times are tame compared to what used to happen regularly

And it seems to me that the world began to change this way around the 1700s

Of course, plenty of people had been promoting humanist ideas for millennia: Jesus, Confucius, Zoroaster... Siddhartha Gautama was probably the most radical, advocating for compassion towards all sentient beings, not just other people

And sure, the value of these ideas was recognized, but even if people wanted to put them in practice they were very limited by the world they lived in. Bartolomé de las Casas comes to mind, who tried to advocate for the human rights of the Native Americans, to much failure

But then starting in the 1700s there are movements like Abolitionism, who sought to outlaw slavery, and although it would take them centuries, they would succeed, and later there would be movements advocating for democracy, gender equality, animal rights, outlawing child labor, among many others, and they would succeed in making the world a better place

One of the soldiers, however, thinking, perhaps, he could do more mischief by killing some of us, had posted himself on a point of rocks, at the southern extremity of the Island, and kept firing at us as we passed along the bank. Several of his shots passed between our files, but we took little notice of him, thinking he was so far off that he could do us but little hurt, and that we could do him none at all, until one of the guard asked the officer if he might discharge his piece at him; as it was charged and would not hinder us long, the officer gave his consent. He rested his old six feet barrel across a fence and sent an express to him. The man dropped, but as we then thought it was only to amuse us, we took no further notice of it but passed on. In the morning, upon our return, we saw the brick coloured coat still lying in the same position we had left it in the evening before: it was a long distance to hit a single man with a musket, it was certainly over half a mile.”

1k40oyw,AskHistorians,"Why did so many ""Cowboys"", Army officers, outlaws, and other people wear their revolvers backwards?","I'm from Texas. I have two quick draw youth trophies and have been around revolvers for most my life. Hell, I will own  a Model 3 Schofield Revolver that's been passed down from my great great grandfather once my father passes. So I love revolvers, but I've never fully understood why some troops/outlaws/sheriffs wore their revolvers backwards. Why? Of course you don't' see someone with a Schofield doing that. Thing is just too big, so you see it more commonly with Colts and other like slimmer firearms. 

I just don't know why. I know that it's situational for each person. Like gamblers and those who sat a lot had a cross draw, those who were more on the range had a lower mid thigh draw, and of course the classic hip draw was seen a lot. But where did backwards revolver carrying come from? What are the advantages (if any) to carrying that way?

1o66604,AskHistorians,"In the case of the Roman sponge-on-a-stick, why isn't the answer ""obviously not""?","I won't bother linking a ton of citations because it's so widespread, but there's this constantly referenced idea that Romans used a shared sponge-on-a-stick to wipe up after going to the bathroom. It's frequently referenced by semi-serious pop-history dudes, as an example of weird ways people behaved in the past. 

Browsing the Wikipedia entry, it seems there's really not a ton of textual evidence that this is the case, but it seems to be a matter of debate among historians.

But the thing is - they obviously didn't, right? Sure, lots of things that we find weird or acceptable today are mere modern social constructions, and all kinds of things were different in the past.

But surely not poop, right? There are both strong biological and cultural reasons people are disgusted by other people's poop - most cultures most basic swear word is a word for excrement. Humans, no matter when they were alive, clearly don't like other people's droppings.

So when it comes to the sponge-on-a-stick, why do historians entertain this idea? That a bathroom had one communal poop-stick, instead of it being something more obvious, like a toilet brush?

I suppose what I'm asking is - isn't there a point where historians say ""wait that's absurd"" and search for other answers?",1125,0.96,1125,0,1174.0,49.0,144,1760416623.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1o66604/in_the_case_of_the_roman_spongeonastick_why_isnt/,False,True
1ijbumx,AskHistorians,Did humans used to have higher pain tolerance in the past or were suicide rates for pain issues much higher?,"Was thinking about this the other day.

One of the worst pains of my life was a tooth infection. It had gotten so bad that if I ate or drank anything, my jaw would ache for hours. I could barely talk and could barely sleep. Without the means to get it fixed in a matter of days I'm not sure what would have happened long term. 

A coworker is currently experiencing gallbladder pain and they feel like they are having a continual heart attack. They cannot stand for long periods, they break out in sweats easily, likewise cannot get much sleep. Again, something that they are likely going in for surgery soon.

Both of these conditions, if untreatable, would make life pretty unbearable.

Did ancient people just....accept this? I feel that either of these conditions would have eventually lead to death, due to the pain making doing other activities eventually impossible.

Or was it a matter of cases like both of these instances just resulting in people wasting away due to dehydration?",1118,0.97,1118,0,1154.0,36.0,38,1738872124.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ijbumx/did_humans_used_to_have_higher_pain_tolerance_in/,False,True
1ou4dhr,AskHistorians,"How did bright yellow become a neutral skin colour in media? (emojis, Lego, Simpsons)","Emojis, Lego, and the Simpsons are ubiquitous today and all share bright non-human yellow skin tones and I was wondering if there is some shared origin to them.

Wikipedia lists the first yellow smiley face as being created in 1962. Next are the Lego minifigures of the 1970s that originally didn't have faces, followed by the Simpsons in 1989, and emojis in the 2000s.

1li3cvc,AskHistorians,"The Silk Road looks absolutely brutal, even in modern times.  Is it as desert-y and deserted as google maps makes it look?","I kind of thought the Silk Road went through the lush parts of India, but it actually goes North around the Tibetan plateau.  It looks like an absolutely brutal, hellish march through the Gobi Desert, and modern-day Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan don't look like a mountain picnic either.  Even driving it in a car in 2025 is still probably quite the adventure, I can't imagine riding on horseback from Xi'an to the Caspian Sea two thousand years ago.  Hell...back then did they even know where they were going???

Even in modern times there's almost nothing from Xi'an to Dunhuang, Dunhuang to Kashgar looks even worse on google maps, and...well it isn't until crossing or walking around the Caspian Sea that things look even the least bit green.
